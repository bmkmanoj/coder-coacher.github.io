featured Android apps with the one
restriction that they can't be installed
by themselves they have to be packaged
into another app to be installed on a
device Android apps tend to consist of a
whole lot of file so while you can
totally create an Android library by
hand it's a lot easier to use the wizard
let's check out how to do that if you
right-click on the root of your project
and select new module under phone and
tablet applications select Android
library you can give your library a name
and a min SDK and then just like a
normal app you can choose what kinds of
activities you want to add let's add a
blank activity with a fragment we'll
give it a name now on my library folder
has been added to the root of your
project with all the familiar source and
res and even a manifest that you'd
associate with a normal Android app also
the wizard is nice enough to add your
new library as a sub project in the
multi project build so the last thing
you need to do to be able to use your
new activity in your base app is to head
over to the build.gradle file in the app
directory and then we'll need to add a
compile-time dependency on the project
my library that's all there is to it
let's check out a working example so
here's the demo from the course code
which I strongly suggest you go check
out we've added this image activity
Android library to our project
this library defines an activity with
its own layouts and with its own values
like strings so here's the message that
the activity is going to display and
this drawable of the Gradle logo is also
wrapped up inside our Android library in
settings dot Gradle image activity is
added as a sub project and in the build
Gradle file of the app directory we have
a compile time dependency on the image
activity project so that means in the
main activity of our main Android
project we can import image activity and
set up an intent to go launch it if we
go ahead and deploy that to our test
device here's the activity from our app
module and our button which then
launches the activity from our Android
library there we go we've made an
activity that's easy to reuse between</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
