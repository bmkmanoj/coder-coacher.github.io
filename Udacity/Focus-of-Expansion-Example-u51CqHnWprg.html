a great old slide I think this slide is
actually from the psychology of computer
vision book by Pat Winston which I think
was 1975 I don't know it's just such a
cool because they it was before we could
do it it's just beautiful anyway so the
idea is here is image on the left and
another image on the right and the
question is taking a time 1 and time 2
how are things moving well if I you just
look at these two pictures it's a little
hard to tell but if I give you the flow
field it's very clear what's going on
right what's going on is the camera is
moving forward all right camera is
moving forward which is inducing this
flow field all right and that's the flow
field of a plane that's gonna be a
homography and there is another flow
field here and you realize this thing
called a demon and that's what's so cute
because back in the old days in AI when
you had little list programs running in
the background and and little things
would run on their own and have their
own behavior they were called demons so
this is a lisp joke anyway so you can
see this demon is actually just a
plainer cardboard thing that is moving
sort of forward and to your right it's
left and you can see that from the flow
field and if you cut up this image into
this area and then that area you would
have two different flow fields both of
which would be homography so they would
both be model flow all right so I'm
gonna show you a couple different things
some is more math some is less math but
it's basically the mathematics behind
models flow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
