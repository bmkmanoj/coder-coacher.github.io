Association in the new dsm-5 criteria to
be diagnosed with major depressive
disorder one must have a depressed mood
or loss of interest or pleasure in daily
activities for at least two consecutive
weeks now remember that this mood must
represent a change from the person's
baseline that is it has to be different
from the way the person usually acts
they must meet at least five of nine
specific symptoms associated with major
depression almost every day for at least
two weeks a depressed or sad or listless
mood that stays low all day for several
days a reduced interest or pleasure in
doing anything a significant change in
body weight that can be either an
increase or decrease in body weight
sleep disturbances sluggishness or
restlessness daily fatigue or loss of
energy daily feelings of worthlessness
self-reproach or excessive guilt lack of
ability to concentrate or think clearly
recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal
ideation now most importantly these
symptoms must significantly affect daily
functioning in terms of both social and
work-related context and also be a
source of distress notice that there's a
wide variety of symptoms and a person
must experience at least five of these
symptoms to be diagnosed with major
depression however it's up to your
doctor to diagnose you with major
depression so if you experience any of
these symptoms and are concerned about
it you should consult your doctor or
counselor check out the PDF we put in
the instructors notes box if you're
interested in finding a therapist this
document can help you now you can see
how these symptoms differ from our
occasional sad or blue moods this is a
lot different than being rejected by
someone or doing poorly on an exam or
realizing you gained a few pounds last
year in the sad moods that can accompany
those events this can be different than
being rejected by someone or doing
poorly on an exam
realising you gained 15 pounds last year
these can be disappointing and produced
negative moods but as far as
debilitating symptoms of major
depressive disorder they just don't cut
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
