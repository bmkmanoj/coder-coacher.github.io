and we want to find out what value
corresponds to this in a normal
distribution with a mean of 50 and a
standard deviation of 10 so here we have
our setup so all we do is multiply 0.56
by 10 and then add 50 so this gives us
55 point 6 so basically what we did is
we took a pretty spread out distribution
with mean 190 and standard deviation 36
we converted it to the standard normal
distribution with mean of 0 and standard
deviation 1 and then we converted that
to a normal distribution with mean of 50
and standard deviation 10 so the score
for each of these distributions
corresponds with the same percentage
less than that score so a score of 210
here the proportion less is exactly the
same as a score of 0.56 here and that's
exactly the same as the proportion less
than a score of 55 point 6 in this
distribution hopefully that makes sense
and if it doesn't don't worry it's going
to make more and more sense as you get
used to working with normal
distributions and in the next lesson
you're going to learn how to calculate
the percentages less than or greater
than certain values on the x-axis good
