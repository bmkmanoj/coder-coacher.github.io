data sets in each of these samples our
sample size is only 10 so here we don't
exactly have fifty percent of the data
but it's pretty close and this will more
and more closely approximate fifty
percent as the data set gets larger
think of it this way we split the data
in half we split it in half and you
split it in half here if this is
twenty-five percent this is another
twenty-five percent another twenty-five
percent and another then here between q1
and q3 we'll have about fifty percent
this one's false we could make this one
a lot bigger and the IQR would still be
the same however we could change this if
we made it safe 59,000 then the IQR
would get a little bigger if we made
fifty 4135 bigger than 60,000 181 then
this would be the new q3 so sometimes
certain values can influence the IQR but
it's not affected by every value in the
data set and the same concept applies
here we have this outlier but even if
this were something closer to the data
set like 63,000 the IQR would still stay
the same so this one's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
