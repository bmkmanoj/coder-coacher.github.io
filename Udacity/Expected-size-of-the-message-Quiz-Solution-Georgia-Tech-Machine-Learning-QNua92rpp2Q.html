will need to know the frequency of a b c
and e but we already know that you will
also need to know how many bits each of
those symbols require now we also know
that so we will calculate the expected
number of pits to transmit each symbol
and then add them up so for any symbol
the expected number of pits is given by
the probability of seeing that symbol
into the size required to transmit that
symbol and we add them up for all the
symbols in the language this is going to
give us 1.75 bits on an average now
since we had to ask less questions in
this language then the previous language
this language has less information this
is also called as variable length
encoding this should give you some idea
into figuring out why some symbols in
Morse code are smaller than others in
the English alphabet the letters E and T
occur most frequently that's why in the
Morse code e is generated by a dot and T
is generated by a dash since e and T
occur more frequently they have the
smallest message size this measure which
calculates the number of bits per symbol
is also called as entropy and it is
mathematically given as this formula to
make it more legible we need to find out
how to denote the size of s more
properly the size of s is also given by
the log of 1 upon the probability of
that symbol so the formula of entropy is
given as this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
