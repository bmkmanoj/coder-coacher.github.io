wondering about well how do actually
bodies move can we tell I used to in
front of my class take a couple of balls
and drop them in front of the class and
I've asked i asked the members of the
class what do you see and most of the
students coming from engineering or
science said you see all the bodies
accelerating in free fall and i would
come back at them eventually and say no
i didn't ask you what you told you were
told you ought to see what do you
actually see and if you try it you'll
find that you don't see much you see the
hands holding the ball you see the hands
