beautifulsoup to parse this HTML so that
we can extract the values we need to
pass along in our post request let's
talk about why these values are here
well as many websites do this particular
data source uses these values to
validate each request that comes in and
if you're really interested in
specifically how for example viewstate
is used I'd encourage you to look in the
ASP documentation to see how those types
of servers use that particular type of
value ok so just in case it's not clear
what we have to do first is submit an
initial request and then use the
response that we get back specifically
the values for view state and event
validation in order to make any
subsequent post requests so let's take a
look at the code now one thing I want to
point out something I didn't mention
last time is that here we've actually
hard-coded in the value for airport list
and carrier list but of course what we'd
be doing is actually looping through all
possible combinations of values in our
Airport list and carrier list from the
data that we extracted using this code
okay so in this code we're making an
initial get request parsing the response
to get the viewstate and event
validation and then submitting a
subsequent post request let's run it
okay here we're writing this out to a
file called virgin and Logan Airport
that HTML let's go take a look at that
file here it is and of course we're
going to lose the style information
because the relative references will all
be broken we're not actually pulling
down the CSS or the JavaScript files
that are referenced in this HTML file so
instead of the data that we wanted
instead we're getting a syntax error so
we need to figure out what's going on
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
