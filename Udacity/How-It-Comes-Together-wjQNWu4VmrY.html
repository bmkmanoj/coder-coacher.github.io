bit I just want to write down sort of
summarize what it is that we've talked
about so far and how it all kind of
comes together and I think it's actually
going to push this back to the very
first slide so we've done MVPs we talked
about SMD PS we talked a little about
what options actually do for you and we
talked a little bit about state
abstraction before this all brings us to
a bunch of neat little facts the first
one is that because we are doing this
SMD p type thing because we are doing
options we get to inherit all of the
optimality guarantees up to a point of
what we had before in regular MVPs with
regular actions so in particular we get
all the convergence proofs we get all
the stability proofs in other words
everything is all nice and welding good
at smtp land as it was in MVP lamp
there's a slight caveat to that which is
worth mentioning and it's really what
you brought up over the quiz which is
well if we don't pay attention to all
these things and we live around in the
option space are we actually going to be
able to really be optimal we really
going to be able to solve the problem do
I need to know all of these things and
the answer is well if you got the right
set of options in the right side of
world rights kind of world then in fact
everything's good but you cannot
guarantee that if all you do is reason
over options that you will in fact end
up with an optimal policy we have
another notion called hierarchical
optimality and that's the notion that
given the set of options that you have
you can in fact converge to an optimal
policy with respect to those options
okay and I think that makes sense and of
course whether you allow those options
to pay attention to all of the state
space also affects whether you're going
to get the true optimality that you
would have or only a sort of optimality
with respect to the particular set of
options and the states the state
features that you happen to be paying
attention to but I actually don't think
this is a big deal right because I think
this is true for the problem in general
so I've got an MDP and I have a bunch of
states I made up the state's anyways if
we've talked about before we talked
about Palm DPS and PSRs it's not clear
these dates I
actually exists in some very real sense
I came up with the state features i
described the way the world was supposed
to be there clearly some ways of
describing the state of pac-man that
make learning easier and some that make
it harder some that allow us to be truly
optimal and some that don't like if I
came up with state features that only
track the closest dots to me I may not
be optimal but another hand it might be
easier to learn and these are trade-offs
that we make all the time so in some
sense we're always dealing with a
limited notion of optimality which we
define with respect to the set of
actions we decide that we're going to
consider and the set of state features
that we're going to pay any attention to
at any given time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
