worm so there's several interesting
things about this internet worm probably
the main one is that it was one of the
first worms that actually got widespread
attention they got this attention for
good reason so if you remember 1988 the
internet was not particularly well known
to the general public and I had a
relatively small number of users and
even so this worm infected an estimated
six thousand machines and while this is
a really tiny number compared to a
modern worm or a modern botnet or
something like this but this is a
substantial fraction of the number of
machines connected to you internet at
the time so the way this worm spread is
used computers internet connections to
exploit known vulnerabilities in the
UNIX hosts of the time of course at the
time the existence of a remotely
exploitable bug wasn't considered nearly
as serious as it would be considered
today because of course the 1988 worm
and all of the subsequent ones hadn't
happened yet one of these bugs was a
buffer overflow exploit in the finger
demon and this was a surface that would
run on UNIX machines of the time and the
finger demon would let you query a
remote machine to learn about whether a
user was logged into that machine and
some other stuff and so now let's ask
the question would random testing have
changed the outcome well it seems
extremely likely not because these were
these bugs were known at the time on the
other hand let's ask a little bit
different question could this bug in
finger demon and lots of other bugs like
it have been found by random testing the
answer to this question is probably yes
in fact if we go back to the original
fuzzing paper one of the buds that was
found was caused by the same programming
practice that provided one of the
security holes to the internet worm so
basically even even in its original
fairly weak form where fuzzing was done
with completely random data it was
finding the kind of bugs they were
causing security holes this remains true
to this day buzzers are used to find a
lot of exploitable vulnerabilities in
hosts that have internet facing services
so in summary but it could have found
the kind of bugs that the worm exploited
and others like it had people been
running fuzzies a couple of years
earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
