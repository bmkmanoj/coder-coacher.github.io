production to Ravens progressive
matrices before we actually talk about
how our agents will do it we can think
of how we would do it when we're solving
a matrix what are the smaller or easier
problems that we're actually breaking it
down into how are we solving those
smaller problems and how are we think
combining them and do an answer to the
problem as a whole once we know how
we're doing it how your agent actually
be able to do the same kind of reasoning
process how will it recognize when to
split a problem into smaller problems
how will it solve those smaller problems
and how will it then combine those into
an answer to the problem as a whole
during this process think about what
exactly is it that makes these smaller
problems easier for your agent answer
than just answering the problem as a
whole and how does that actually help
you solve these problems better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
