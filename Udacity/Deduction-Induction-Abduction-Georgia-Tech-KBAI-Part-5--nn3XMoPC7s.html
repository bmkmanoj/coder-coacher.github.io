understand these similarities and
difference between deduction abduction
and induction let us look at the
relationship between a rule cause and
effect let's consider a simple rule like
if it is cloudy it rains so it is cloudy
is the cause it rains is the effect if
it is cloudy then it rains is the rule
another example of a rule would be the
rule that Bob HL so Bob HL so whenever
Joe walks in Bob leaves the cause is Joe
walking in the effect is Bob leaving and
the rule is Bob hates Joe you've already
come across yet another instance of this
particular arrangement when we were
talking about flu and fever so the rule
might be if flu then fever flu is the
cause fever is the effect now in
deduction in one fundamental kind of
inference we know the rule and the cause
and we need to deduce the effect so
given the rule if it is cloudy then it
rains and given the cause it is cloudy
we can deduce that it rains similarly in
our rule that Bob hates gel we can say
that if Joe just walked in we can deduce
the Bob will leave or if the rule is if
flu then fever and we know that Ashok
has flu then we can deduce that Ashok
has fever this is simply an instance of
modus ponens and we discuss this in
detail when we were talking about logic
now let us look at induction give it a
relationship between a consonant effect
we can try to induce a rule for example
if we observe repeatedly that when it is
cloudy it rains it may be inducer rule
if it is cloudy then it rains
same thing with Bob and Jo if we observe
repeatedly that every time Joe arrives
Bob leaves we can induce a rule the Bob
must hate gel if every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu and the
patient has fever then we can induce a
rule of flu then fever in case of
abduction given a rule and an effect we
can abuse a cause as an example given
the rule if it is cloudy then it rains
and the effect that it is raining we can
ask ourselves is it cloudy and once
again with Bob in gel given our
rule that Bob hates Joe and given that
we just arrived at a party and we see
that Joe is here but not Bob we might be
able to abdusamad left when Joe arrived
or given the rule a flu then fever and
the fact that Ashok has fever we might
be able to abuse that Ashok has flu
first of all notice that we are back to
diagnosis diagnosis as an instance of
abduction but notice several other
properties first deduction is truth
preserving if the rule is true and the
cause is true we can always guarantee
that the effect is true as well
induction and abduction are not truth
preserving we may know something about
the relationship between cause and
effect for some sample that does not
mean that the same relationship holds
for the entire population induction does
not always guarantee correctness same
for abduction we may know the rule and
the effect and we may suppose that it
causes true but that need not
necessarily be true it may be the case
if flu then fever and a shock may have
fever but there does not necessarily
mean that a show-cause flu fever can be
caused by many many things the reason
that fever does not necessarily mean
that Ashoka's flu is because there can
be multiple causes for the same effect
multiple hypotheses for the same data
this is exactly the problem that we had
encountered earlier when we were talking
about what makes diagnosis hard we said
the deduction induction and abduction
are three of the fundamental forms of
inference we can of course also combine
these inferences science is a good
example you and I a scientists observe
some data by the world then we abuse
some explanation for it having abuse
that explanation for it we induce a room
having induced a rule now we can use
production to predict new data elements
we go and observe some more again we
abuse induce reduce and we continue the
cycle might be cycle also explain
significant part of cognition is this
what you and I do on a daily basis abuse
induce
reduce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
