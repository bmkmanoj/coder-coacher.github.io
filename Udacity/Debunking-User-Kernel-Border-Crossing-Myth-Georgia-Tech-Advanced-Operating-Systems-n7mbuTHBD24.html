systematically debunks all of the myths
I detailed in the previous slide the
first myth is the border crossing myth
that is the user space to kernel space
switching now l3 accomplishes this
border crossing in 123 processor cycles
and this includes the TLB misses that
may be incurred because of the fact that
we are going from user space to kernel
space as well as cache misses that may
be incurred because we are starting to
execute some code in the microkernel all
of that put together every shows by
proof of construction that you can do
that border crossing and 123 processor
cycles and l3 goes one step further it
actually counts through a
back-of-the-envelope calculation what
will be the minimum cost involved in
doing this border crossing or in other
words how many cycles will the
instructions that are needed in order to
do this border crossing take on a
particular processor architecture and
they count the number of processor
cycles and they show that the number of
processor cycles needed is about 107 and
l3 microkernel accomplishes that in 123
processor cycles or in other words this
is debunking the myth that border
crossing is going to be expensive and
microkernel based design it's as close
to what it would take
minimally in the processor even if you
hand code through machine instructions
what needs to happen to go from the user
space to the kernel space so that is
proof that microkernel based design is
not going to be incurring any more
overhead for border crossing it turns
out that CMU's mark operating system on
the same hardware takes nine hundred
cycles as opposed to the 123 cycles
taken by l3 for border crossing spin and
exokernel that we have looked at and
fairly great
used mark as the basis for decrying
microkernel based design saying that
well border crossing in microkernel
based design is expensive because it
takes this much time but what l3 has
shown is that it need not take this much
time it can be done in much shorter
amount of time which is close to what
the hardware can actually do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
