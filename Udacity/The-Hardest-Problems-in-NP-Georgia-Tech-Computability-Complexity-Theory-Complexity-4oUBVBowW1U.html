classes P and NP in mind you can
visualize the classes like this clearly
P is contained inside of NP and we're
pretty sure that this containment is
strict that is to say there are some
problems in NP but not in P where the
answer can be verified efficiently but
it can't be found efficiently but no one
knows how to prove this yet in this
picture then you can imagine the harder
problems being at the top now suppose
for a moment that you encounter some
problem where you know how to verify the
answer but where you think that finding
an answer is intractable unfortunately
your boss or maybe your adviser doesn't
agree with you and keeps asking for an
efficient solution how would you go
about showing that the problem is in
fact intractable one idea is to show
that the problem is not in P that would
indeed show that it is not intractable
but it would do much more it would show
that P is not equal to NP you would be
famous as we talked about in the last
lecture whether P is equal to NP is one
of the great open questions in
mathematics so I'm going to cross that
out I don't want to discourage you from
trying to prove this theorem necessarily
you should just know what you're getting
into another option is to reduce another
intractable problem to your problem if
you are working in the early or
mid-1970s you might have reduced linear
programming to your problem practical
methods for solving some linear programs
were available but most people thought
that in general it was not polynomially
solvable since a solution to your
problem would solve any linear program
your problem must be harder the trouble
with this approach is that it was later
shown that linear programming actually
was polynomial solvable hence the fact
that your problem is as hard as linear
programming doesn't mean much anymore
the class P swallowed linear programming
why couldn't it swallow your program as
well this type of argument isn't
worthless but it's not as convincing as
it might be it would be much better to
reduce your problem to a problem that we
knew was one of the hardest in NP so
hard that if P were to swallow it it
would have had to have swallowed all of
NP in other words we'd have to move this
line here all the way up to the top
such a problem would have to be
np-complete meaning that we can reduce
every language in NP to it remarkable as
it may seem it turns out there are lots
of such languages satisfiability being
the first one for which this was proved
in other words we know that it has to be
at the top of this image turning back to
how to show that your problem is
intractable short of proving that P is
not equal to NP the best we can do is
reduce an np-complete problem like Sat
to your problem then your problem would
also be np-complete and the only way
that your problem could be polynomial a
solvable is if this line moves up here
and everything in NP is polynomially
solvable there are two parts to this
argument the first is the idea of a
polynomial reduction we've seen
reductions before in the context of
computability here are the reductions
would not only have to be computable but
computable in polynomial time this idea
will occupy the first half of the lesson
the second half will consider this idea
of NP completeness and we'll go over the
famous cook-levin theorem which showed
that boolean satisfiability is
np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
