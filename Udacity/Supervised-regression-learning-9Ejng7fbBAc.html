learning that we're going to focus on in
the first part of this course is called
supervised regression learning those are
a few big words let's break it down word
by word we'll start in the middle here
with regression regression is a weird
word
I don't think whoever chose it to
represent what it means did a good job
but we're stuck with it all that
regression means is we're trying to make
a numerical approximation or a numerical
prediction that's as opposed to
classification learning where we might
be trying to classify an object into one
of several types as opposed to making a
numerical prediction supervised means
that we show the Machine the X and also
if you will the correct answer or Y in
fact we show the machine many many
examples of x and y and that's how it
learns okay when I see this X this is
the Y that's associated with it
that's the supervised component finally
when we say learning what we mean is we
are training with data in this class
we're taking historical stock data and
training the system to make a prediction
about the future usually about price
there are a lot of algorithms that solve
this problem and our supervised
regression learning techniques you've
probably heard of linear regression and
used it linear regression is a method
that finds parameters for a model so we
call it parametric learning K nearest
neighbor or K and n is an extremely
popular approach and in fact you're
going to build a KN n learner as part of
this class what's different between
parametric learning and instance based
which K and n is an example of is that
in parametric learning we take the data
munge it around to come up with a few
parameters and then throw the data away
in K nearest neighbor we keep all of
this historic data the x and y pairs and
when it's time to make a prediction we
consult that data that's what makes it
instance based anyways we'll spend a lot
of time talking
k-nearest neighbor two other techniques
that are really popular are decision
trees and decision forests as you might
guess the way decision trees work is
they store a tree structure and when a
query comes in
it essentially bounces down that tree
according to factors of the data each
node and the tree represents essentially
a question is this x value greater than
or less than this other value and
eventually we reach a leaf and that is
the regression value that's returned
decision forests are simply lots and
lots of decision trees taken together
and you query each one to get an overall
result so this is a definition of
supervised regression learning which
we're going to use a lot and these are
various algorithms that solve that
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
