looking at some variables that are
highly correlated this time we'll look
at the number of likes users received
from friends on the desktop version of
the site this is the ww likes received
we'll compare this variable to the total
number of likes users received which is
the likes received variable now you
could of course get likes received
through the mobile version but we're not
going to look at that here so now I'm
gonna hand it off to you I want you to
create a scatterplot of this variable
versus this variable and it should make
sense that likes received should be
higher than WW likes received since some
of the likes may be coming from other
sources either mobile or unknown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
