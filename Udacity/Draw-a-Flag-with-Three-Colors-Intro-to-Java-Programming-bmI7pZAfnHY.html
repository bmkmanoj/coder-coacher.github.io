again we're giving an arbitrary point on
the flag let's remember that X moves
this way Y moves this way so in this
case the y-value doesn't matter at all
what matters is where X is the total
width here is given to us so this cut
off here is width over 3 and this one is
width times 2 over 3 so the first
condition here is going to be X less
than width over 3 or maybe less than
equal width over 3 let's settle that so
let's assume that the width was 300 then
X could be any value between 0 and 299
the first hundred values from 0 to 99
should be blue the values from 100 to
199 should be white and the values from
200 to 299 should be red so the last
value that stays in this branch here
should be x equals 99 which is 300 which
over 3 is 100 so the less than is
correct we want to be less than 100 to
stay here as soon as we are between 100
and less than 2/3 of the width we want
to be in the middle branch branch and
finally if neither of those is true then
we want to be here and that's the code
the takeaway is if you need to make
multiple decisions then you use the if
else if else clause sarah has prepared a
bunch of practice problems for you so
that you get more exercises that involve
making these kinds of decisions have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
