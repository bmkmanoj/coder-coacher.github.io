difference learning so temporal
difference learning the algorithm that
we're going to look at originally by
Sutton is called TD lambda this is a
little lambda symbol so T descends for
temporal difference and what really it's
about is learning to make predictions
that take place over time and so as a
concrete example a concrete way of
looking at this we're going to look at
how we can from a sequence of states
state zero goes to state 1 goes to state
2 goes to let's say a final state and
each time there's a transition there's
some reward that's associated with with
that we're going to try to predict the
expected sum of discounted rewards from
that okay which is what we're trying to
do anyway yeah so this is going to be a
really important subroutine for trying
to do reinforcement learning because
we're going to use the the notion that
we can predict future rewards to try to
better choose actions to generate high
rewards ok that's fair all right so for
the kind of prediction problems that
we're going to be learning with temporal
difference methods it's helpful to have
a concrete example to kind of ground out
some of these terms so here let's say
let's take this as a Markov chain with
States s 1 s 2 s 3 S 4 S 5 and s F for
the final state I've labeled each of the
transitions with the reward that happens
when you make a transition from that to
the next and this particular transition
out of S 3 actually is a stochastic
transition with 90% probability going to
s 4 and 10% probability going to S 5 ok
what makes it what we'd like to learn
here is a value function of a function
that map's the state to some number
where that number is set to 0 for the
final state and for every other state
it's the expected value of the reward
plus the discounted value of the state
that we end up in averaged across all
the different states we might end up in
ok great
ok good then let's have a quiz ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
