suppose we want to find a shortest tour
for this graph and in order to help with
that we first find a minimum spanning
tree for the graph so let's mark the
edges that are part of the minimum
spanning tree in purple here like so so
if you were to take a tour along this
minimum spanning tree let's say starting
at a might do something like this
starting at a then through D&amp;amp;G and back
to d through e through h back to e bcf
and then all the way back along the
route back up to a so maybe you can see
that there are some redundancies in this
tour for example we go to d back down to
G and then back up to D so instead of
going along this tree route let's
optimize a bit let's instead of always
following the minimum spanning tree
let's compute this tree route first but
then instead of following it we look at
the next vertex in the tree route that
we haven't gone to yet and we take the
shortest path there so for example we
would start out at a and in the next
vertex along the path is d so we go
there and then G so we go there but then
the next vertex that we haven't visited
yet along the tree path is e naught D
and we can go there just by
short-circuiting here so we cut d out
and go straight to e then we'd go to H
and again the next unvisited vertex
along the tree path is B naught E but
there's no shorter path than this from H
to be so we would still follow it in
this case then C and F would still be
unvisited so we would follow them
exactly but then the next unvisited
vertex well is all the way back at a
since we'll just say that the first
vertex is unvisited well then what we
really want is the shortest path from F
to a not necessarily along the tree
route and you can see that shortest path
is actually along up here so instead of
following this tree path we have a
slightly shorter tour that sticks close
to the tree path but doesn't necessarily
follow it exactly now my questions then
are what percentage improvement do we
get in this tour versus the original
tree paths and second what approximation
factor do we achieve in this specific
instance now remember in order to figure
out the approximation factor you
need to calculate the optimal tour
length for this graph please input your
answers in the two boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
