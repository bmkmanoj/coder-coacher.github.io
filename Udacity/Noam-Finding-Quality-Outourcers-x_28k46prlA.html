vendors that's 1 million dollar question
it's so hard to find them to find them
it's it's even harder than hiring
because basically you are interested in
finding someone that we do the job that
you need to do right now in a cheaper
price but hopefully in a better quality
and this is hot and a lot of off showing
professional are still struggling with
finding the perfect Wendell because you
need the job to be perfect Oh at least
like in a very good standards you need
them to be video for you at all time to
be responsive you need them to be a will
of costs you need them to be cost
effective and you need them to really
work with you and share the culture with
you and finding this perfect fit for the
long term can be very challenging and
the best ways to find an outsourcer is
very similar to the best ways to find a
new employee within a new partner you're
going to reference to your colleagues to
people you value the opinion and you're
asking them who do you work with when
did you had a good experience with an
outsourcer you're going to events and
you're trying to find professionals that
are similar to you that are using
outsourcing services oh you're getting
lucky basically you're walking with an
elance odesk and you're trying and
you're starting to test them you're
doing a lot of professional exams grace
period you're basically testing the
waters and and eventually choosing one
and that that's what I did I worked with
a lot of outsourcing companies along the
years and about a year ago I found in
outsourcing company that now I can call
my partners and we work I'm walking with
them in like like and then walking with
them like they were in my team it's
about about 12 people that we're doing a
lot of a lot of stuff every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
