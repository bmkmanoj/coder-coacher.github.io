in a row in the last quiz we talked
about running time and space time but
now we're going to talk about how the
knn algorithm actually works and in
particular how different choices between
distance metrics values of K and how
you're going to put them together can
give you different answers okay so what
I have over here on the left is training
data this is a regression problem and
your training data is made up of XY
pairs X is two-dimensional okay so this
is a function from R squared to some
value in r1 okay so the first dimension
represents something and the second
dimension represents something and then
there's some particular output over here
and what I want you to do is given a
query point 4 comma to produce what the
proper Y or output ought to be given all
of this training data you with me yeah
okay so I want you to do it in four
different cases I want you to do it in
the case where your distance metric is
Euclidian okay the distance metric in r2
yes
oh I see because we're gonna measure the
distance between the query and the
different data points yeah okay so it's
Euclidean for a case of one nearest
neighbor and three nearest neighbor and
I want you to take for example in the
three nearest neighbor case I want you
to take their output and average them
okay okay now in the I also want you to
do the same thing but in the case where
instead of using including in distance
we use Manhattan distance but again for
both one nearest neighbor and three
nearest neighbor and in any case where
we have ties like in three nearest
neighbor where we absolutely have to
have at least three of these things show
up just let them average okay and we're
doing averaging instead of straight
voting because this is a regression
problem got it okay any questions maybe
let's see and so if there's ties we
would use the College ranking trick of
including everybody who's at least as
good as the K largest or K closest yes
exactly okay you know I think
then go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
