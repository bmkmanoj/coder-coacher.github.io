originally used in late 1970s on floppy
disks and became the standard and dos
and early Windows machines it is still
commonly used on solid-state and flash
memory devices like this one as these
storage technologies have evolved it has
gone through many iterations but the two
key ideas have remained the same the
first is that each file is represented
as a linked list of blocks normally when
we think of a linked list we think of
the links as being part of the nodes in
the list maybe the last part of the
block would give the ID of the next
block here however the links in this
list are represented in the file
allocation table which is indexed by
block number giving the starting block
number of a file I can find the next
block with a constant time access to the
file allocation table a special value
negative one in this example indicates
that a block is the last in the chain
this file allocation table also contains
a bit to say whether a block is free or
not in this example our file starts with
block two looking at the table I see
that the next block is six looking at
six in the table I see that the next
block is three again going back to the
table I see that the next block is five
and then I look at five in the table I
see that it's next has the special value
indicating that we've reached the end of
the file it's important to realize that
the file allocation table or fat for
short stores all the links for all the
files for instance there appears to be
another file occupying block four and
only block four since that it's the end
and also one occupying block one so the
file allocation table tells us how to
glue the blocks of a file together but
it doesn't tell us where to start these
chains of blocks that is the function of
the directory tables directories I
should say are indeed treated as files
and they use something called a
directory table format entries in the
table all have the same width and
contain the essential information
including the file name the starting
block and any other metadata associated
with the file such as permissions the
route file directory has a fixed address
on the disk so we always know how to get
started let's say that I wanted the
content of a file /foo
/ file.txt I would first consult this
root directory table it would tell me
that there is indeed a directory named
foo and give me the starting block of
that file I would then access that file
on the disk and since it's a directory I
would look through there for the file
name txt and it would tell me that the
starting block is 2 I can then chain
together the blocks on disk as we did
earlier using the file allocation table
to summarize then the fat or file
allocation table serves as the glue that
changed the blocks of a file together
the directory files capture the
hierarchy and the starting blocks for
the files and all the metadata</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
