have to look at Michael and we're going
to have to come up with some clever way
to look through them and this gets us
back to something that we've talked
about before which is the notion of bias
and in particular the notion of
inductive bias now just as a quick
refresher I want to remind you that
there's two kind of biases that we worry
about when we think about algorithms
that are searching through space one is
what's called a restriction bias and the
other is called preference bias so a
restriction bias is nothing more than
the hypothesis set that you actually
care about so in this case with decision
trees the hypothesis set is all possible
decision trees okay that means we're not
considering y equals 2x plus 3 we're not
considering quadratic equations we're
not considering non boolean functions of
a certain type we're only considering
decision trees and all that they can
represent and nothing else okay
so that's already a restriction bias and
it's important because instead of
looking at the infinite number
uncountably infinite number of functions
that are out there that we might
consider we're only going to consider
those that can be represented by a
decision tree over and you know all the
cases we've given so far discrete
variables but a preference bias is
something that's just as important and
it tells us what sorts of hypotheses
from this hypothesis set we prefer and
that is really at the heart of inductive
bias so Michael given that what would
you say is the inductive bias of the id3
algorithm that is given a whole bunch of
decision trees which decision trees
would ID 3 prefer over others so it
definitely tries B since it's since it's
making its decisions top-down it's going
to be more likely to produce a tree that
has basically good splits near the top
then a tree that has bad splits at the
top even if the two trees can represent
the same function good point
so good splits near the top right and
you said something very important there
Michael given two decision trees that
are both correct they both represent the
the function that we might care about it
would prefer the one that had the better
split near the top okay so any other
preferences any other inductive bias on
the on the id3 algorithm it prefers ones
that model the data better to ones that
model the data worse right so this is
the one that people often forget it
prefers correct ones to incorrect ones
so given a tree that has very good
splits at the top but produces the wrong
answer it will not take that one over
one that doesn't have as good splits at
the top but does give you the correct
answer so that's really those are really
the two main things that are the
inductive bias for id3 although when you
put those two together and particularly
when you look at the first one there's
sort of a third one that comes out as
well which is id3 algorithm tends to
prefer shorter trees to longer trees now
that preference for shorter trees
actually comes naturally from the fact
that you're doing good splits at the top
because you're going to take trees that
actually separate the data well by
labels you're going to tend to come to
the answer faster than you would if you
didn't do that so if you go back to the
example that we went before where one of
the attributes doesn't split the data at
all that is not something that ID 3
would go for and it would in fact create
a longer and unnecessarily longer tree
so it tends to prefer shorter trees over
longer trees so long as they're correct
and they give you good splits near the
top of the tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
