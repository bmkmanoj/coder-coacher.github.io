same amount of money every month which
means that the total amount of money
that he spent will increase
incrementally as each month goes by we
know then that the total amount of money
spent can't just be equal to the money
spent each month our answer down here
has to involve time to for example after
one year grant will have spent way more
money than he had after just one month
of being in business so that means that
this first answer right here can't be
right because it doesn't involve time
however since we know that the same
amount of money is spent each month the
second choice right here is the correct
one it says that the total amount of
money spent after a certain amount of
time is equal to the money spent each
month times the number of months that
have gone by these two bottom answers
don't involve the amount of money that
grant is spending so we can just
eliminate them also for good measure
great job on this quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
