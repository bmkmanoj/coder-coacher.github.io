just look at how UNIX does it for
example so you provide a user ID and
your password we use the user ID due to
select the entry in the password file
for this user that we're talking about
the salt is stored here the hash value
stored here is in it this is sort of the
data structure we keep to log in you're
going to supply your password so we
start on this side later on so this is
what is set up initially for create the
user account or set up the password at
that time we determine the salt and
compute the hash value and things like
that so later on a user comes types the
password well they saying who they are
you give your user ID login name based
on that we're going to find the hash
value and the salt so the salt and
password going to be put through this
hash function and it's slow because if
somebody is doing brute force pays to
slow them down so we pass these two
things through the hash function so this
is typed by the user based on the claim
by the user who they are this is what we
find in the file that we have where we
store the salt value so the two are
passed as input to this the result is
compared with the stored hash value if
the two match then we allow
authentication is successful if they
don't match then authentication fails so
this is what happens when we have make
use of salt to deal with different users
speaking the same password and a result
having the same hash value and I would
be a problem when you add salt the
rainbow based rainbow table based attack
think about what would happen to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
