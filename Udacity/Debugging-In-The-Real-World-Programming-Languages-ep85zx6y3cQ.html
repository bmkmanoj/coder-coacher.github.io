bit about debugging which is made up of
testing and then trying to localize or
isolate the fault and then fixing it I
actually had a chance to work at a
lovely company in santa barbara green
hills software where my job was to do
just that for just the sort of
interpreter that you're writing every
day I'd come in and there would be a
stack of input programs on my desk and
our interpreter or compiler was
currently computing the wrong answers
for them and I would do this sort of
hypothesis testing that we've been
considering here at say oh what if the
bug is in the top half of the program
then I can comment out the bottom half
and I should still see the bug now that
didn't work maybe I'll hypothesize now
that the bug is in the bottom half of
the program I'll comment out the top
half and we'll still see the bug and I
could refine my way down maybe it's in
the top fourth maybe it's in the top
eight until eventually I had a very
small input that still showed the bug
and then it was easy for me to localize
the fault and fix it the process was
relatively lockstep so lockstep in fact
that a few years ago a researcher
aundrea Zeller published a technique for
automating it his approach called Delta
debugging makes it systematic does this
systematic hypothesis testing by
dividing a program input in half and
half again until it finds the smallest
input that still reproduces the bug in
fact looking back on it now the job that
I had is almost completely automated
when you run into defects or bugs in
your code and you probably will I
certainly do all the time I want you to
apply that same level of formal
reasoning think about where the bug
might be make a test case that probes
are falsifies that hypothesis localize
the defect and then move in to fix it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
