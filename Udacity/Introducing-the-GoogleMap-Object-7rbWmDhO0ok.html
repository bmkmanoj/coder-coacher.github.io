fragment or a layout file and set
properties on it to get some pretty
interesting and cool maps we even had a
3d flyover of New York City that was
pretty cool right
well that just scratches the surface of
the types of app that you can build with
maps integration the XML based Maps
always start in the same location and
that can be limiting for a mobile app so
in order to get a little more power and
flexibility we're going to switch gears
and start using the Google Map objects
to complement the map fragment using
Java code once we've gotten that it then
becomes really easy to set properties
and respond to user events on the map
let's start with an example where we set
the different map types such as the
standard map the satellite view or the
hybrid view in this app you can see a
map of New York City and I have control
over this map by touch I can pan around
the map and as you can see I can pinch
to zoom in and out when I press the
buttons at the top of the map map
satellite and hybrid I can change the
map type so if I touch satellite I now
can see details of the buildings taken
from satellite pictures you can see
Madison Square Garden and even when i
zoom in I can begin to see some of the
seating plans in Madison Square Garden
and of course hybrid gives me a hybrid
of the two
I can see satellite but I can also see
data such as landmarks like the Empire
State Building and street names such as
Fifth Avenue as you can see here I've
done all of this using a Google map
object in my java code this is slightly
different from the fragment that you
used in the earlier sample and we're
going to dive into take a look at how to
do this next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
