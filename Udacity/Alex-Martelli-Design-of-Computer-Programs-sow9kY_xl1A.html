Martelli the well-known Python
programmer and author let's go in and
talk to Alex in traditional Python the
type while type is strongly connected to
an object an object stipe that is
absolutely crucial to that object but
it's not connected to the name a name a
variable if you want to call it that I
would prefer to use the word name can
indicate any object whatsoever there is
no constraint a name is the name is the
name well if it quacks like a dachshund
walks like a duck it's a duck turns out
it was discovered a few years later that
there's actually a bird which while it
does like its morphologically
indistinguishable from a darker but its
DNA analysis proved it's a goose so well
but the point is that if you wear a
chef's it needed to decide how to cook
it you'd probably want to use duck
recipes because it doesn't have the
amount of fat of the goose so they don't
really care about the DNA so instead of
checking the type of an object the
concept was just make sure it has the
methods with the signatures that you
need which you can do simply by tried
and that leads us to it being easier to
ask forgiveness some permission you try
literally within a try statement and if
the signature is wrong or the name of
the method is wrong you get a tribute
error type error and catch it in an
accept calls and either propagate the
error or handle it appropriately now
with the introduction of abstract base
classes the type becomes useful because
it's not anymore a type in the sense of
an implementation it's a type in the
sense of an abstraction so for example
there's a numbers abstract base class
and if you want to verify that your
argument is a number
actually asking if it is an instance of
number it doesn't constrain at all the
implementation they obviously internally
the implementation of unbounded
precision integer versus say 32-bit
float is going to be drastically
different but they're both numbers
meaning they both have greater than less
than plus minus x and so on so that kind
of chai check is now respectable in
Python not anything concrete but checked
for the abstraction that's it's a duck
typed constraints if you will if it is a
number then you're guaranteed of all a
set of methods operators and signatures
that you don't have to check separately
so look at it as a bundle of such
operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
