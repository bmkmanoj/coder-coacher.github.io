one more thing that I want to say before
I start writing out little formulas and
trying to convince you that this is
something that we can do with some of
the framework and infrastructure that we
built so far and I want to do it by
diving in and sort of doubling down on
this idea of drama management on this
idea of going through a story so you're
an AI person and you need to kind of
think about how you're going to build a
system where a player can learn how to
go through a story where can go through
a story and have a good time so the
first question I'm going to claim you're
gonna have to ask yourself is well
what's a story what's the story really
and for the purposes of this discussion
i'm going to just assert something and
you can tell me if it makes sense to you
and that is that a story it turns out is
just a trajectory it's just one of any
possible mini number of possible
trajectories through a space that is
made up of plot points so does that make
any sense to you do you know what i mean
by that so you're being abstract about
what stories are yes I'm being very
abstract that abstraction is important
because we're computational and plot
points I guess plot points makes me
picture graph where there's points in
there's edges or there's vertices in
there's edges so a plot point is like a
vertex yes right so a plot point is like
a little circle and that plot point
might represent something like oh what's
your favorite kind of story mystery you
like mysteries okay cool so I have a
plot point that's something that has to
do with the mystery so what happens in a
mystery so there's a murder what yes
that's a plot point there's another plot
point maybe and that plot point is
there's an accusation there's another
plot point which is a weapon is found
and there's a whole bunch of these and
if they're set up right and their
sequence just right if of all the
possible paths through all the possible
plot points are set up just right so you
see the murder you see the accusation a
weapon is found and so on then you have
something that looks like a murder
mystery now I want to point out that
it's possible to have good murder
ministries and bad murder mysteries so
if you think about the way a murder
mystery works right it's got this really
neat structure there's a murder nobody
knows who did it that's what makes it a
mystery and then eventually you discover
that every single person in the house
had a reason to kill the person who was
killed
and you find a weapon that points to a
particular person it's a it's Mike
everyone knows is that person and then
that person gets killed that's Michael
again no and then you know therefore it
was it Michael or curly and so then you
keep going and you discover it was in
fact not curly and then you find out who
the real murderer is and there's a whole
bunch of things that happen very quickly
and it turns out it was the butler all
along that would have done I guess and
that makes it a good murder mystery now
here's a bad murder mystery there's a
murder and you happen to see it and so
you know who the murderer is okay and so
then the murderer has to go off and
start killing you and everyone else they
can you run away and you know what
you've got instead chasing movie you've
got a horror movie so the difference
between a murder mystery in a horror
movie and not that much difference it's
really about whether you know who's
doing the killing or not so if I have
all these elements lined up in some kind
of out of virtual game depending upon
what the player of the game is doing I
may have to interfere interact with
what's actually going on underneath so
that the player experiences a murder
mystery as opposed to experiencing a
horror flick and when you say you might
have to do that you mean the drama
manager right because the agent can
describe what it means to be a murder
mystery and as a player they'd the
author can control the player as the
player is going through the system is
may have to interact with that in order
to make certain that you still get a
good murder mystery as opposed to
something else and I'm going to claim
that if we think of these points as
being key things that happens in the
story and some sequences are better than
others then what we end up with is a
story is a trajectory it's a trajectory
through these plot points and that a
good story is a particular kind of
trajectory and there are bad stories
which are other kinds of trajectories
and we need to figure out how to
influence the player in such a way that
we go down the good trajectories instead
of The Bachelor director can you save a
word about what the players doing here
well so it would depend upon the
situation but imagine that I mean you
play games like zork and various or
things right you sure you have vague
memories of hitchhikers guide to the
galaxy and those like text adventure
games you're interacting with the system
somehow and you decide to go north or
you decide to open a door you decide to
talk to somebody it's just like I choose
your own adventure
that's the kind of idea that I'm trying
to evoke here interesting okay and so
you're saying that we could think of
this as a kind of mdp and then do
reinforcement learning in it yes that's
what I'm going to talk about I want to
convince you if you buy this idea of
story as trajectory with plot points and
it's actually pretty easy to turn it
into an MDP ok I would like to hear
about that ok let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
