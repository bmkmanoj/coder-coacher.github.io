defocus imply here so here basically now
I'm showing you this old image because
of the fact things there are different
distances and the fact that I have
optics and the sensor itself any image I
take will have this artifact right these
objects are a little bit further away
they're out of focus and this frame here
this part of his date that's in focus so
only a few specific planes depending on
the camera and the aperture and stuff
like that would be in focus so this in
essence is the artifact of a traditional
camera system we will always have scenes
at different depths all of them will
have a different focus and of course the
question comes up is can we actually
compute the depth just from knowing this
focus planes that are different in this
image so definitely focus basically is
attempts to infer depth by analyzing the
local scale that is how is much is the
definite difference in the frame itself
or difference in the focus itself in
local parts of the image and use that
computer defocus blur and if I actually
can figure out the defocus blur I can
actually kind of claim knowing the lens
that I have how far a certain object is
that's what basically you saw in last
example the more I moved the object
I got a different blur out of it now if
I could actually create a relationship
between this I could actually start
computing depth we saw examples of that
when we talked about computing depth
from images in the lecture on stereo but
the bottom line is this is an extremely
difficult and ill posed problem because
we actually have a tougher time of
actually figuring out the calibration
that will allow us to figure out how
much the focus blur exists and different
parts of the image that will allow us to
then actually compute how far those
objects are in that image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
