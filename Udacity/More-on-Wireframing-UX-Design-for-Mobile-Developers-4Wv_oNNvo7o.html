help us complete the task of dorm room
Debbie going from being hungry to being
satisfied with pizza it's important that
we start with these high level steps
before we start thinking about any of
the details as part of the wireframing
process we need to remind ourself of our
persona and their use cases so her use
cases are she's up late and she wants
pizza right away or it's been a long
week and she wants to try something new
and fun now this is a mobile app so
regardless of who the user is
we cannot violate the following mobile
user constraints such as limited data
and battery life handedness divided
attention and so on and the next step is
our feature list the feature lists is
driven by dorm room Debbie's attributes
and her use cases let's not focus too
much on how we're gonna put these
features in our application just yet but
let's just look at them in a list look
below in the instructor notes and you'll
find a link to this Prezi open it up in
your web browser and follow along for
the rest of lesson and now we're going
to dig a little bit deeper into the flow
of our app so we showed you the four
high-level steps that we need to go
through to complete the task of Debbie
going from hungry to being satisfied now
let's jump into the flow for each of
these steps so here's step 1
this is the screen that a user sees when
they first enter the application and
honestly there's only one of three
things they can do they can build a
brand new pizza if they've never used
application before or they can reorder a
previous pizza if they've uses have
before and if they have a pizza that's
already in order they can check its
order status so in order to begin we
will pick the first option which is
they're gonna build a new pizza step two
is where the user is going to configure
their pizza and make sure that it's
exactly what they want by choosing the
size the crust of toppings side orders
and so on now if they don't want to
actually build a pizza they can view the
daily specials and pick one of those and
the third step is where they checkout
and pay if the user hasn't already
signed in they'll do so here if they've
already saved their payment and delivery
information they can easily just skip
through those steps or they can enter it
in and then they place their order so if
you've used that application before step
three will be really fast all you have
to do is click place your order once
Debbie's placed her order she'll see the
order status
and if she has a question about her
order she can contact the driver so
let's say that debbie has placed an
order for a pizza already that was a
couple of days ago she liked the pizza
she likes the app she came back in and
now she wants to reorder the same thing
again this is where she would select
option 2 which is reorder of previous
pizza this flow was actually really
really simple
she's probably signed in already if she
hasn't then she will be asked to sign in
this might seem a little bit strange but
consider the possibility that debbie has
more than one phone or more than one
Android device you could have a tablet
multiple phones and so on anyway so if
she's signed in then she'll be able to
see all the order history for previous
orders and then select one and place an
order for now we're back to step three
which is checkout and pay because she's
already signed in all she'll have to
press his place order and step four will
be the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
