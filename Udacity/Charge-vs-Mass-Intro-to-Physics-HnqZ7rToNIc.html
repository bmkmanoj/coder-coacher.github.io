similarities between charge and mass
specifically similarities between the
electric force and the gravitational
let's do some comparison to see just how
similar or how different these forces
are first let's analyze the cause of
each force well the electric force is
caused by charged objects where's the
gravitational force well it's caused by
massive objects so charge and mass are
the causes of these forces what about
the effect what kind of object feels the
effect of the electric force well once
again it's an object with a charge
likewise gravitational force is felt by
objects with mass so notice we already
see one similarity the thing that causes
the force the same is the thing that
feels it what about the force law if I
force I mean what's the equation that
describes these forces well with gravity
we knew the force of gravity was
proportional to 1 over your distance
away from the massive object that's
causing the force in the case of the
earth and the moon our would be the
separation between the two bodies with
the electrical force it turns out the
force law is almost identical it's still
proportional to 1 over R squared so
doubling the distance will decrease the
force by a factor of 4
what about the direction of force well
for gravity objects always attract each
other
in fact it's this attraction that allows
large bodies like the earth to form
because every little tiny chunk of rock
is attracted to every other little tiny
chunk of rock and together they coalesce
and form this wonderful beautiful sphere
what about with electricity this is
where things get interesting with
electricity the direction is not always
attractive sometimes it's repulsive and
this one key difference is responsible
for many of the fascinating aspects of
electricity which well we can learn
about now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
