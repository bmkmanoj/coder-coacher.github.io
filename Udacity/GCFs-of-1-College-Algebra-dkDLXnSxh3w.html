look at this and really the first thing
you should check for whenever you look
at any polynomial expression is that
there's a common factor of two in every
term in the expression so let's start by
pulling that out now we only need to
concern ourselves with what's inside
these parentheses just have to make sure
that we don't lose track of this too now
it's time to factor by grouping we can
pull a two x squared out of these first
two terms and the last two terms are a
little bit tricky because they only
share a factor of well one so that is
what we will write luckily we still see
that we have a common factor between the
two terms we have left the fully
factored form of this is then 2 times
the quantity X minus 3 times the
quantity 2x squared plus 1 now in the
event that you forgot to pull out the
common factor 2 at the very beginning
all is not lost we can still solve the
problem that way too let's check it out
if we start off by grouping instead of
pulling out the common factor of 2 then
we could just proceed by factoring by
grouping is normal we end up with X
minus 3 times 4x squared plus 2 at this
point however when we think that we're
fully factored we have to take that last
step to double check and make sure that
neither these factors has a greatest
common factor greater than one we see
however that this term for x squared
plus 2 has a common factor of 2 between
its terms then we pull that out and that
is what gives us our final factored form
which of course is the same answer that
we got doing the problem the other way
awesome job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
