there's many ways you can solve this
question but the one that I think is the
most fun and probably the most useful is
figuring out how range the distance you
can throw an object scales with the
acceleration on a planet and what do I
mean by that I mean figuring out this
proportionality is the range
proportional to the acceleration in the
planet is it proportional to the square
is it proportional to something else
let's see if we can find that out so
this is become a question of how does
range scale with acceleration and the
reason what we're looking at
proportionality sorts of arguments it's
because these two numbers the range on
earth and the range on this unknown
planet how far we can throw these rocks
so we also know their ratio and ratios
are used whenever we have these
proportionality sorts of arguments well
we already showed in the previous
problem that the optimal range occurs
have 45 degrees so if we throw something
with an initial velocity of V 0 these
are the horizontal and vertical
components well when we're calculating
range the first thing we want to know is
how much time does the objects been in
the air and we think of measuring to the
top of the trajectory and then
multiplying by 2 how do we find the time
it takes to get to the top well we use
this equation we plug in our known
values and solve for T now you'll notice
I haven't been using numbers I've been
keeping everything in terms of variables
except for this 45 degrees this can be
an intimidating tactic to use when
you're first solving physics problems
often you tend to want to plug
everything in but actually you can often
get more interesting results if you
leave the variables in place and don't
plug into the very very end anyways this
is the time to the top of the trajectory
but we know the full time is twice that
so I'll just put it to here once we know
the time how do we find the range well
we use this equation and now I've
plugged in for the initial velocity the
initial X velocity V zero cosine 45 i've
multiplied by the time that we just
calculated because remember in the
x-direction the acceleration is always
zero okay let's simplify well i've
multiplied the VZ rows together to get
this V zero squared and actually if I
carry out cosine 45 times sine 45 I find
that's just equal to one-half this part
the one-half cancels with it too I find
that my maximum range is equal to my
initial velocity squared over a now I
don't really care about V zero squared I
want to know how range scales with a and
it turns out well it's proportional to 1
over a or r is proportional to aid the
negative one well so what how do I use
that just like we did early in the unit
we found that we can write a ratio and
the ratio of the range on earth to the
range in this unknown planet is going to
be equal to the ratios of the
accelerations taken to the negative 1
power negative 1 power just means flip
what you have inside I can solve this
for the unknown acceleration and I get
this equation the acceleration on our
unknown planet is equal to the ratios of
the ranges times the acceleration on
earth when I fill in what we know I find
that the acceleration on our unknown
planet must be 1.6 meters per second
squared which is exactly the
acceleration on the moon and we've
figured out where we are amazing work
there were other ways to solve this
equally valid but this is one tool that
you should try to familiarize yourself
