really good idea if you fired up your
own blue jay and moved to lesson two
days as your project when you open it
you will see the screen with a day block
here and this is what gives us objects
let me show you how to make an object
you right-click on it and you select the
line that says new day you can now give
it a name for right now we'll accept the
default down here you find your first
object this is how blue jay represents
objects as little blobs it's a little
known fact that all objects are red and
to manipulate an object you again right
click on it you can ask it to get the
current year here's the answer this
particular day is somewhere in 2013 see
when the month is March 3 the day of the
month is the 20th that's the day that I
recorded this lesson we can make another
day object and now let's pick the first
line here now we asked which year month
and day we might actually want let's
fill in something we'll pick a year of
1964 the month of 11 or November and the
day of 28 as I'm sure everyone remembers
on November 28 1964 the first spaceship
was to Mars was launched now here we
have another day object it looks just
like the first one it has a different
name but if we wanted to find out
anything about it so we can in the same
way ask it
what's your year and here it tells us
nah let's do something more interesting
let's take our first object here and
let's ask it what day comes a hundred
days later now it doesn't look like it
but this object now has changed it has
moved itself a hundred days later
remember it was originally March 20th
now when we ask it what's your month
you'll see it's June that makes sense
from March one hundred days it's June or
maybe it would be July so how this thing
knows how to
this computation about the day it's June
28th I wouldn't have known how to do
that except by tediously getting out a
calendar and counting the days
butter or de object knows how does it
know I don't know I don't care it
doesn't matter I can use it as long as I
understand what it does for me so that's
a great example of an object something
that knows how to do a very specific
thing namely to deal with calendars just
like the water heater knows how to do a
very specific thing namely to heat water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
