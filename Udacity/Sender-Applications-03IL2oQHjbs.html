cast sender application first off you
should know the cast SDK uses an
asynchronous callback design to inform
the sender applications of events like
connects and disconnects to the cast
device as well as whether commands were
received for example let's say a sender
app sends a message to a receiver to do
so you'll implement a couple of
callbacks provided by the STK so your
app can be informed of whether it was
received we'll go into each of the steps
of a sender lifecycle by looking at the
cast hello text example which you can
find in the instructor notes the reason
i like the sample as a teaching tool is
because it contains a one file sender
app inside of main activity the only
other files we need to look at our
manifest and our menu xml and again you
can find the corresponding receiver app
inside the receiver folder now off the
bat you should know that some of the
code will cover is going to be
simplified by the cast companion library
which we'll get to in the next section
of the course but it's important to see
how it works from the ground up when you
get started also just a reminder don't
use this project as the starting point
for integration used cast videos instead
let's start with the manifest the
minimum android sdk version supported by
cast is nine which is gingerbread or
version 2.3 next the applications theme
needs to be correctly set based on the
minimum android sdk version for example
you might need to use a variant of
themed app compat believe it or not
that's it for the manifest of course in
a production app or with the cast
companion library you'll need a couple
of permissions and we'll get to those
later on now on to the sender
application inside of main activity our
first job is to initialize the cast API
and to do so will obtain an instance of
the media router you'll need to hold on
to this instance for the lifetime of
your sender application and a good place
to do it is inside your oncreate at this
point the user has launched our sender
application and we've initialized the
API now it's time to discover available
cast devices behind the scenes the media
router detects cast devices both on the
local network and by proximity will need
to filter those cast devices for just
ones that can run your application and
to do so we'll use the media route
selector this is important because if
you have a video playing application you
wouldn't want to show the user an option
to cast to a stereo our application ID
by the way is to find in our strings.xml
file but here it's displayed by Android
studio for convenience and remember this
ID corresponds to the custom receiver
app already published for this
application but in our own app of course
we'd have our own next up we'll need the
media router
call back this is used to inform our
sender app when the user selects a
device they want to cast to and we'll
see how they do that with the cast menu
in just a sec first notice that our
activity extends action bar activity
there are a couple different ways to add
the cast button but the easiest is to
use the media router action bar provider
here's how we add the cast button to the
actionbarcompat using the media router
action bar provider in our menu XML and
inside on create options menu we assign
the media route selector to the media
route action provider in the action bar
menu now to trigger the discovery of
cast devices we add the media router
call back to the media router instance
note that we're doing this inside our
activities on start method to conserve
battery power we remove the call back
when our activity is stopped at this
point the user can select a cast device
using the menu in their app once they do
our sender application is informed via
the media router call back and you can
see that happening here inside the on
route selected method now it's time to
launch the receiver app to do so we'll
need an instance of the Google API
client which contains the cast api's we
use the connection callbacks to be
notified whether or not the connection
was successful and once the connection
is confirmed our sender application can
launch the receiver app by specifying
the application ID we found on the cast
developer console at this time we'll set
a couple of callbacks and if you see how
far the right we're getting invented
you'll know this is never a good sign
fortunately this task is greatly
simplified by the cast companion library
we'll get to in a sec now that the
receivers launched its time to control
it by sending messages to do so we'll
need to set up a custom message channel
the sender can use this channel to send
string messages to the receiver each
custom channel is defined by unique
namespace it's possible to create
multiple channels just make sure they
all have unique names there are some
rules about this namespace that you can
find in the instructor notes once the
sender application is connected to the
receiver the custom channel can be set
up and as usual we create some callbacks
to be informed if our messages were
received again this is simplified by the
CCL now that our channel set up the
sender application can use it to send
string messages to the receiver a good
trick here if you need to send a complex
message is to simply encode it in JSON
and then decode it on the receiver side
and the response from the receivers then
captured using the callback we set up
now it's time to handle disconnecting
from the receiver when the user selects
the stop
on the cast menu you can see how that's
done inside our tear down method that
was a quick tour of the basics of the
sender lifestyle next up we'll learn
about the cast companion library or CCL
for short which greatly simplifies
working with cast on android here's an
optional learning exercise you can do if
you really want to learn how to write
cast applications now you know the
basics of senders and receivers the best
next step is to try and write your own
sender what I'd recommend doing is
creating a new Android studio project
with a blank activity for a phone or a
tablet next add simple cast support to
it so you can send a message to the
custom receiver we already have from our
low caste example to help you with this
you can find links to documentation in
the instructor notes and if you can do
this successfully you should feel really
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
