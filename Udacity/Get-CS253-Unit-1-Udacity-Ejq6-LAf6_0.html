to talk about HTTP if you recall this
was what we described as the main
protocol of the web this is what your
browser uses to talk to the two web
servers HTTP stands for hypertext
Transfer Protocol request from your
browser for the URL w example calm / foo
begins with a request line it looks
something like this this is the request
line now HTTP is a very simple text
protocol so this text is sent over the
internet to the server just like this
it's human readable to the request line
has three main parts first is the method
next is the path and finally is the
version the method is what type of
requests are making to the server the
most common method by far is get and
this is how you get a document from the
server other popular methods are get and
post there are other ones but these are
the ones we're going to use in the class
next is the path in this case it / foo
you remember this from the URL that the
path in the URL comes here this is the
actual document we're requesting from
the server and finally is the version
it's always HTTP / and then a version
number most browsers and servers these
they speak 1.1 but will also touch on
1.0 a little bit in this class because
1.0 has you know a few uses of its own
now you're wondering where the host name
is in this requests line it's not here
all that's here is the path we're
connected to this host your browser
connected to this host or if we're
playing with HTTP we made the connection
but that's how we know where we are so
that's this is used for making the
connection and the path is used for
making the request let's have a quick
quiz given the following URL example.com
/ foo / logo.png ? p equals one hash
tricky what is the request line to get
this URL using HTTP 1.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
