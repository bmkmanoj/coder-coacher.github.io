three three is definitely going to match
and we hope we're going to get to this
in a minute our numbering rule and then
we're going to end up converting it into
an integer so 33 looks pretty good is
will match the word is less will match
the word less then will match the word
then 55 could be converted to a number
give us the integer 55 and all of this
white space in the middle will be
dropped so this is a possible answer
here we have pretty much the same thing
except that we appear to be returning
space as a word that's not going to
happen because our words can't include
spaces and this whitespace rule would
skip over it beforehand that's not it
here looks a lot like the beginning but
instead of matching 33 and 55 as numbers
we appear to have matched them as words
because we've returned the string
unchanged this isn't really what we
wanted but actually nothing prevents
that from happening
33 could match either our word regular
expression 3 is not a space it's not a
less than it's not a greater than or our
number definition and I haven't told you
how to resolve this sort of ambiguity oh
that word is back from the dead this is
also a possible answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
