of the interaction between testing
domains and trust relationships between
different entities so let's say we have
some sort of an interface here and on
both sides of it we have people we trust
here's me here are some of my teammates
and so the question we have to ask is
can I trust my teammates and can my
teammates trust me to always generate
inputs when using the various AP is to
remain within the main of those inputs
and of course the answer is generally
now in fact I probably can't even trust
myself to always generate inputs that
are within the within the domain of
acceptable inputs for api's and so what
this brings us to is the idea of
defensive coding that is to say error
checking for its own sake to detect
internal inconsistencies and this is
something that will get to a little bit
later during this unit so overall
testing software by calling into the API
is that it provides is fairly
straightforward we just make calls into
the API and look at the results but
something inconvenient about real
software is is that software doesn't
just provide AP is it also uses them
what I mean here is that software under
test is going to be issuing calls into
libraries and getting returned values
into the operating system and into
virtual machines such as the Python
runtime and so let's take for example
just for the next couple of minutes the
idea that the software under test is
something like a web browser now one one
thing we can do is test the web browser
using the API is that it provides that
is to say using musing its graphical
user interface and not worry about
testing it with respect to the API is
that it uses and so what kind of API is
is the web browser using well for one
thing it's talking to the network it's
talking to the hard disk through the
operating system it's talking to all
sorts of lower-level interfaces and
sometimes those api's don't act as we
would expect and just as a simple
example let's take the case where our
web browser is storing cookies here I'm
trying to draw a chocolate chip cookie
soren cookies onto the hard drive of the
local computer most of the time during
testing we expect the storage and
retrieval of cookies to operate
perfectly normally but what happens if
for example the hard disk is full when
the web browser tries to store a cookie
does the web browser crash does it
mangle its internal state in some
fashion and become impossible to use or
does it gracefully stop storing cookies
for that session
and for example wait until there's more
disk space free before it starts to
store cookies again well of course we'd
like our web browser to do the right
thing whatever it is but on the other
hand we need to actually test this if we
just hope that the software does the
right thing then one of the golden rules
of testing is we shouldn't ever just
hope that it does something we knew that
we do actually we need to actually check
this so the problem is that we have this
fairly awkward problem where we don't
actually control how the operating
system responds to calls that we make
and but what I'm what I mean by that is
the awkward thing here is that we don't
actually have direct control over how
the operating system responds to calls
that we make so we can't easily just
make storage of a cookie file fail
rather we would have to do something
like create a full disk partition
arrange for our web browser to store
cookies there and then see how it
responds and so in this particular case
creating a folder disk partition is
awkward but we could do it but there are
plenty of cases where lower level
software has failure modes so we really
can't easily simulate regardless of how
hard we work so we're going to now is go
back to our friend the UNIX read system
call let's take another quick look at
the UNIX read system call and so this is
a UNIX processes read from files and so
of course real UNIX programs are issuing
calls to read constantly maybe hundreds
of times per second and so earlier we
were concerned with the domain of the
read system foe that is to say the set
of possible valid arguments to the read
system call and now we're concerned with
a range because now we're not testing
the UNIX operating system anymore we're
testing a program that runs on top of
the UNIX operating system and so it's
the response of the operating system
back to the process that's concerns us
here we can see here is the reid returns
the number of bytes read from the file
but there's an interesting fact here
that read is allowed to read less bytes
than you actually asked for so it's
going to return some number between 0
and count but we don't know what number
it's going to return another thing that
we can do is just fail out right that is
to say it can return minus 1 to the to
the application but it turns out that
there are a whole lot of different
reasons for that kind of a failure we
can see here that there are at least
nine different error conditions the read
can return we have e again you would
block e bad f default etc and the point
is for the application that's calling
read the operating system can return
any of these values and these values
aren't all semantically equivalent the
application might have two different
things depending on which of these
values it gets and the point is it might
be very hard as people testing the web
browser to actually make the operating
system read call return all those
different values and until we've tested
with all those different values we're
left with software whose behavior we
don't we probably don't understand and
therefore its software that hasn't been
tested very well and so I'd like to tell
you that there's some really great
solution to this problem but there
really isn't and the fact is is that a
lot of real programs around on operating
systems aren't prepared for some of
these odd or strange or responses that
the operating systems can deliver and
consequently when those things happen
the software malfunctions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
