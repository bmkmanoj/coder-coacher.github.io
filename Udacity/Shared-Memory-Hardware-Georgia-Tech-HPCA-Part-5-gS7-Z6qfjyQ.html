do we have we can have multiple single
cores that share the same physical
address space so all of them can issue
addresses to any memory address and the
examples we have seen of this are the
Yuma and Numa both of them actually are
individual cores each of them being able
to access the entire address space the
other extreme is to only have one core
and then do multi-threading basically
run two threads by just time sharing the
same core so because they are now
running really on the same core they are
naturally accessing the same physical
memory so we get the shared memory
behavior simply by virtue of actually
not having more than one core and now
the question is is there something in
between them because this is not really
capable of benefiting from having
multi-threading we can have Hardware
multi-threading support in one core that
actually tries to benefit from there
being multiple threads this Hardware
multi-threading can be at a coarse grain
where we change the thread we are
working on every few cycles and we now
need to have harder support that
switches between threads this often
because without hardware support we
would be spending all of the time just
saving and restoring registers of these
threads so we actually need to now have
every thread has its own set of Hardware
registers and so on so there is hardware
support needed for this we can have fine
grain Hardware multi-threading where
every cycle we are working on another
thread this of course needs even more
hardware support because now we need to
be able to very quickly change between
these threads and we can also have
simultaneous multi-threading or SMT
where in any given cycle we could be
doing instructions that belong to these
different threads this is called
simultaneous multi-threading or SMT and
it's also called hyper threading by some
manufacturers of processors so now we
need hardware support for any one of
these three and of course the hardware
support becomes more extensive as we
move
coarse grain two fine grain two
simultaneous so the question is but what
do we benefit by kind of sharing the
same core by multiple threads don't we
get the same thing as here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
