called automated white-box testing and
this isn't a form of code coverage but
what a rather is is a way to get
software tools to automatically generate
tests for your code so you wrote some
code and the questions that we're gonna
ask is how to generate good test cases
for it
of course one answer is we can use the
kind of techniques that I've been
talking about for this entire class we
can think about the code we can make up
inputs we can basically just work hard
to get good test coverage but another
answer is we can run one of these
automated white-box testing tools and so
let's see how that works what this tools
goal is is to generate good path
coverage of the code that you wrote so
it starts off basically just making up
random values for your code let's say
one one and one for the inputs so now
it's just gonna go ahead and execute the
code the first question is is a a prime
number and so it's not
it wasn't prime the first time it's
still not prime so we're gonna return
zero so now that the automated testing
tool has seen a path through the code
that didn't take both of the if branches
soon to try to construct a new set of
inference for the function they take a
different path so the most obvious
choice point to start with is the first
if so the question the tool is gonna ask
is how can i generate an input that's
prime and so to do that of course that's
gonna have to look at the code the test
for primality so it's going to end up
with is a set of constraints on the
value of a which are going to be passed
to a constraint solving tool and the
answer if the solver succeeds is going
to be a new value of a that passes the
formality test so let's say a is 3
though automated white-box testing tools
come up with a new set of inputs to this
function and it's going to go ahead and
run it again so this time the first test
is going to succeed a is prime we're
gonna increment B by 3 decrement a by 10
and now a is gonna fail to primality
tests since let's assume our formality
checks won't assign to detect positive
now the new value of a minus 7 is going
to fail the prime allottee test and
we're gonna again return 0 so the
question we have is was the tool learned
what it's learned is one execution that
falls straight through another execution
that takes the first different ranch so
now what it's going to do is try to
build on that knowledge to generate
inputs that also take the second branch
so it's going to take the first set of
constraints that is the constraints of
for say to be prime it's going to add
another set of constraints that force
the updated value of a that is to say a
value 10 less than the original value of
a to be prime so it's going to turn that
all into a set of constraints pass it to
the solver and the solver is either
going to succeed in coming up with a new
value of a or possible it'll fail but
let's assume it succeeds and so let's
say that the value of a it comes with
this time is 13 we're gonna actually get
the function again 13 is prime so we're
going to add 3
to be subtract 10 from a giving 3/3 is
prime so now we're going to ask if B is
an even multiple of 20 if so we would
return 7 but it's not so we're going to
return 0 the third time through the
function it's going to add a new
constraint so not only are we keeping
all of our constraints on a but we're
adding a new constraint on B the B mod
20 has to come out to be 0 and so this
time the solver let's say comes up with
a is 13 and B is 20 now it's got
actually get to function another time
this time returning 7 and so by
iterating this process multiple times
that is to say by running the code and
then using what it learned about the
code to build up a set of constraint to
explore different paths what we can do
is generate a set of tested inputs that
taken together achieves good coverage
for the code under test unfortunately I
don't know of any automated white-box
testing tools that exist for Python for
your C programmer there's a tool called
Cletus you should try out which
implements these techniques and I
encourage you to do this please a really
interesting tool and so as you might
expect in real situations a tool like
this might fail to be able to come up
with a useful system of constraints or
to solve them for really big codes and
in fact that's absolutely the case these
tools blow up and fail on very large
codes but for smaller codes like the
kind of thing I'm showing you here
actually do a really nice job
automatically generating good tests in
bits and as it turns out these
techniques are used fairly heavily by
Microsoft to test their products in the
last several years for the finding of a
very large number of bugs in real
products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
