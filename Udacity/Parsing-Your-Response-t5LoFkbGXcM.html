get from these ap is and they're kind of
unwieldy although they are somewhat
readable at first glance it's difficult
to extract something useful from these
responses but these json responses are
easily possible in Python I'm going to
call the get geocode location function
again but this time store the result in
a variable named Alice so when I called
Alice I get this huge JSON object again
looking at this response I can try to
better understand the data that Google
Maps is providing to me all of the data
that looks like coordinates is in this
portion of the response i see quite a
few coordinates though so which ones are
the ones that i need well reading
through the response the first thing I
noticed is that google is giving me an
approximate set of coordinates that
correspond to the northeast and
southwest bounds of the city then it
provides a suggested viewport for
viewing the entire city on the map but
this final set of coordinates seems to
correspond to a central set of
coordinates for the city these are the
ones that I want to extract by typing
Dallas keys I can navigate through the
keys of the JSON response like a Python
dictionary in some cases I see that Keys
contain lists of values so by using the
square brackets I can reference to an
index inside of these lists after
navigating through this response for a
little bit i found that going into
results then the 0th index then in
geometry location and lat gave me the
latitude i want it similarly going down
the same path and then using lng returns
the longitude coordinates I want it so
I'm finished extracting just the
latitude and longitude coordinates for
my geocoding request I'll modify my
gioco di file like so such that now it
responds the latitude and longitude
coordinates I'll also comment out the
response header for now as well the code
for this activity can be found in the
instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
