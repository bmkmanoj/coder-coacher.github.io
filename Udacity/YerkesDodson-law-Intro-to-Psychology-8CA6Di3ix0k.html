the yerkes-dodson law
so the yerkey dotson law states that
moderate levels of arousal lead to
optimal performance so think back to our
lesson on consciousness where we talked
about our levels of awareness at one
side of the continuum we were
unconscious so in a coma
we had zero awareness and at the other
end of the continuum we were fully awake
and aware so the idea here is somewhat
similar except instead of having
awareness on a continuum we have our
level of arousal on a continuum like you
see here we go from low levels of
arousal to high levels of arousal and we
also have quality of performance from
low to high so the idea here is that we
prefer to be in situations that are
neither over stimulating or under
stimulating for example over here when
you're highly aroused you'd be panicked
and you probably wouldn't perform very
well and around here you'd probably have
a lot of anxiety and again your
performance would it be that great in a
little higher up we'd see stress or
optimal level of performance would still
be decreasing when we're under stress
but we are highly aroused here we'd be
mildly aware or awake but not really
into whatever we're doing a little
farther down we'd see boredom and
finally towards the bottom is where
woods find sleep so we really want to be
in this central area for the optimal
level of performance we see this is
important not only for things like
academics this could even be like for
playing sports so say you're playing
hockey you're soccer you don't want to
have too high of a level of arousal
because then you're going to be panicked
or have a lot of anxiety which will
decrease your performance but you also
don't want to be really bored or kind of
tired and not really there you want to
be in this middle zone
that way you can perform your very best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
