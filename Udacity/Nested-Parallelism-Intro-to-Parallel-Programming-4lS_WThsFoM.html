use other parallel patterns as well and
that's where it gets really interesting
there's nested parallelism where I can
call a parallel function from inside my
parallel program that's taking a
parallel program creating other parallel
programs so if I have a cut sequence of
kernels a b and c inside a CUDA stream
and kernel B wants to do its own
sequence of steps x y&amp;amp;z I can just
launch that work in line from B exactly
where I needed without nested
parallelism might have to work x y&amp;amp;z
into B's code and make a huge program or
do some gymnastics with the CPU to
launch the work where for example I
would split B into I would come out to x
y&amp;amp;z and I'd come back to the second half
of B that's all very complicated to
write and very complicated to manage
it's much much simpler if I can simply
launch my work directly out of B so
here's an example suppose we want to
adjust a volume of an audio stream we've
got an incoming sound wave this green
wave right here a lot of sound
processing requires us to have a certain
maximum volume which means constraining
the wave to fit within these two dashed
lines right here we could write a
parallel program to deal with this by
creating a kernel to process this wave
which would then perform sequences of
parallel operations to cause the
rescaling of this waveform so I'd feed
this wave into a kernel and the kernel
would break it down into a series of
blocks like a normal CUDA kernel would
do the first step would be to find the
maximum peak value in parallel say 1.8
volts so having found the maximum peak
voltage my kernel would then launch a
second kernel which would rescale
everything by the 1.8 volts to end up
with a normalized one volt peak-to-peak
audio we're combining several bulk
parallel algorithms into a single
program operating on the whole wave at
once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
