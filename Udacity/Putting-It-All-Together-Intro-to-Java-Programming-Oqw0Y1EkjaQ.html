we've tested it let's put it to use
you're going to write a program that
takes a user input word and tells how
many times it occurs your code will be
able to do this when you're done with
this you'll be able to run look up any
word it'll ask you to type a word and
it'll look it up so I'll type Hatter and
press ENTER and it tells me how to recur
as 55 times I'm gonna give you some
pointers you'll want to make a new book
like we do in book tester you'll also
need to use a scanner
don't forget the import also you saw how
to read an int or a double but you
didn't see how to read a string with the
scanner you'll need to look at the
scanner documentation scanner has a lot
of methods you'll want to use one of the
ones that starts with next and returns a
string if picking the right scanner
method makes your head hurt click the
link that says hints I'll go over this
part in detail in the answer video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
