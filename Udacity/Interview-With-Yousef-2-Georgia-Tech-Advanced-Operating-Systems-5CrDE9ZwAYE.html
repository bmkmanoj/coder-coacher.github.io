also the fact that more and more we are
seeing end users using mobile platforms
yeah
and mobile platforms are tying into the
cloud and so as the future revolution
happens in the data center things are
changing what do you expect as changes
that are happening at the consumer end
of these services to be asked a consumer
and is driving Masada's and the
classical enterprise IT is following so
the the consumer revolution and mobile
and small devices on the like are
driving much of what its criteria and
the benefits then is accruing over time
to more usage of the of the systems so
give me one example day with more more
collaboration needs or sharing of state
your gonna put more state in the backend
to be able to share that with your
multiple users what they need to do
things beyond just messaging you know
you know sharing sharing data sharing
state and the like you'll find out that
data would flow quite a bit from from
the devices to the backend and their
physics however the device can't be very
big the battery device cannot be very
big so the device can only do so much so
the back end have to do it for your name
and find the balance between them will
change over time of course but this also
brings an interesting concern that is as
you said there's gonna be more that's
happening in the backend well because
the mobile devices may not be able to do
it all and you also mentioned that they
may be collaboration among the mobile
devices and a lot of the things that
happen in mobile devices today is
streaming kinds of things and how ready
is the cloud for dealing with that kind
of traffic and particularly you also
mentioned that cloud is architected
today is throughput oriented not so much
latency oriented so what do you see as
changes that might be coming the
different type of streaming out there
okay so for the the bulk of internet
trafficking by the way are streaming go
pre-recorded material and the way the
Internet can handle it at large as you
know it's more through caching so you
have so-called CDN networks
content distribution networks what the
content distorted edge closer to the
user and once he asked for a movie and
your neighbor asked for it second time
is almost free and by and large that's
of working frankly I mean in depending
where you are in a word Netflix for
example in the u.s. is very big and so
forth to do more real-time and it
becomes more interesting and more
cumbersome to be honest I think I think
things would change as well but I have
to tell you I am myself amazed how well
it works already in that sense the
latency aspects are have to do with
ultimately with physics so there will be
cases where if your application requires
a lot of Chatty what's the protocol
which will component you have to think
seriously about where they should land
if it's very chatty and physics and as
the same we cannot change the laws of
physics there to be closer to each other
so decomposing the app whether it be
real time life streaming of data or
video or whatever is very important to
put chatty stuff and where they should
blend which is where they can withstand
a long distance right but that also
brings up the question of data centers
as they're architected today they are as
you mentioned they're in some dark room
somewhere but if my mobile device is
latency sensitive shouldn't they be
closer to where the tool and device will
be multiple levels so you want to put
some computation on device that's if the
latest between two components is so
critical
there's no way can cross any wire so
some will live in a device itself some
will live on the edge of the network
before you get to the actual DC and
increasingly the mega services on the
internet don't directly hit you don't
hit the DC directly equal to an edge
somewhere and you do also when
optimizations tcp/ip optimizations for
example you may lend to an edge closer
to you and they're the connection
between that place and the actual DC or
aggregate over common tcp/ip connections
so tricks like that very important
latency hiding tricks very important so
this next question I'm going to ask you
is
or related to from a student's
perspective you know the students that
are taking this course there's an
advanced operating systems course and
and these students they may be aspiring
to work in leading software companies
such as yours what would be your advice
to students that are taking this course
specifically can you talk to the
students about the opportunities that
exist for always designers today in the
industry space and how the students
should prepare themselves for such
opportunities sure I'll be honest with
you you may not design new OS from
scratch we have a bunch of them already
but every concept you're learning here
will be needed more than beneficial
needed when you move up and down the
stack if you're doing an application
like motor discussion we had right now a
high scale application it's it's no
longer writing an application drawing on
a machine by itself display into a
screen all the issues we touch on you
have to worry about you have to know
about them you have to do odd caching at
scale you have to know what
synchronization data replication
handling failures so all these concepts
you have in a classical OS sense are
directly applicable regardless where you
live up and down the software stack so
I'm convinced that without a fun strong
foundation operating systems and a few
other topics programming language is
under like one cannot handle okay we'll
build those big applications you could
do some simple web programming do some
JavaScript and a nice animated screen
don't get me wrong this is important but
if you want to do the real scalable
services where the industry is moving
you have to have the foundation see more
generically you have to also use the
information you learn here and be ready
to learn more and to apply it in
different domains so the classical
papers that you taught me way back then
are still relevant but as we discussed
theme you have to apply them differently
to move them evolve them into new order
or areas so I want to make sure the
students get an idea about specific
things that you
that they should get when they are in
school what are the things you can name
specify I mean specifically can you name
a few things that you think are
important for students to get while they
are still a student here college time
the time you take it right now to learn
all this stuff is the most exciting time
to be honest because you can keep an
open mind and go white so learn as white
things as possible if you want specific
things in computer scientist be specific
here definitely operating systems
distribute systems and definitely
programming language the background I
think they're very important the
foundations for any platform level type
of work if you want know the classical
information but also know how to apply
them and what you actually have in
everyday under like what that's what I
want to do frankly beyond CS I would
also try to get other background that
complement what I do even things like
humanities on the like they're actually
important because when you move up and
you want to work in industry and the
like much what we do we actually write
code we design code we implement and so
forth but you're also no longer build
things by ourselves
none of the systems you have and your
disposal and we build by one person
label by teams so learn how to work in
teams learn how to deal with other
people like you who have to collaborate
and build software in the lodge some of
these tricks can only you may also know
you may only learn the basics in college
but as you go forward you can apply them
to build large software and also don't
shy away from the tough assignments you
know you know push the envelope or you
can right now they come back and you can
really apply them as you go forward
lastly a good foundation and just
knowing the basic is computer science
basic you know algorithm algum design
analysis is actually the important some
of the more advanced topics nobody'd ask
you an industry what NP is equal to P
and go solve this will not solve that
but you will have to reason almost every
day about the basic complexity of
algorithm or the best way to apply
certain technique under like
so the foundation algorithms are really
important as well so outside of school
while they are in school let the chance
for them to hone their skills overall
what do you think I think that they
should be observing outside of school I
would start the habit now outside the
school to keep track what's happening
out there if you join industry tomorrow
you will in a sense have stopped
learning what the college stuff is and
you started going and learning what's
happening out there
and things move very quickly out there
let alone so start right now
understanding what's happening in
general so know the fundamentals but
also know how people are applying them
be curious I mean I sometimes bring up a
browser look at an application under
thing I know it's Ajax doing press for
api's and so forth so learn how to be
curious from right now and learn to link
what you do with what you see around you
as well and that habit has to start
early and don't stop it keep keep going
that was leaking happiness for you to go
to I know industry and spent five years
doing the same thing and nothing but
that you have to be able to be curious
and see around you as well and that
habit has to be started right now so the
next question is very specific to you
and your own journey from a student in
the 80s to becoming a leader in your
chosen field what are some of the skill
sets you wish you had acquired when
you're still a student if you reflect
back what are the things that you would
have done differently or learned
differently as a student honestly I mean
I'll be quite honest with you I took the
least amount of humanities I could get
and I loaded my schedule with CS and EE
class as a math because there was the
fun stuff the heavy stuff and not get me
wrong that's obviously important too but
take a balanced view to things the
humanities are important knowing what's
really around you beyond just the actual
code and the bits was very important and
the reason very simple reading which is
important is to answer when you go out
there and
do things you'd be expected to lead to
work with others and to tell them what
to go if you are so you can lead them we
can follow it's better to lead to be
honest and to lead you need to have soft
skills and ability to understand people
so learning about the humanities worried
about critical thinking and writing are
actually very important and sometimes we
in academia don't pay enough attention
these things to be honest so it would be
great to make sure you hone your skills
in that space as well I mean a critical
for example in the u.s. a critical
English writing class may sounds you
know too much work and why do I need
this but it can really hone your skills
for critical thinking critical analysis
of the language we so fast for 20 years
or my key is more than that and you have
to send an email explaining why
something is going right is going wrong
with cetera conveying the message and
two paragraphs or some busy people
that's actually a skill as little do a
writing code to be honest but more of
can I put my thoughts down to paper
quickly and clearly and concisely those
are those softer skills or analytical
skills are important too so this is more
of an advice for me of professors like
me from your experience in your opinion
what you would how do you think we can
better prepare our students to be ready
for the workplace there's a couple of
dimensions one is just to build a last
door and they were switched on a
different point one dimension is that in
academia you go into a class you're
going to give a grade to every student
and the greatest his or her grade so in
academia we basically look at the
individual performance did I pass or not
we don't even own the same happens in
industry but to get to do anything in
industry you have to collaborate so
what's usually missing in the more
academic environment is how to build
software for example in a group and how
to do the soft skills for building
software in a group and those things are
hard to get I know in academia but
there's something I wish you can get
more the graduate with that background
if you are
you typically have something in you when
you when you're a good leader but then
when you go join a company on the like
you have to go nurture and do more of
that really what happened beyond that
there are some things which would be
great if you make sure that the students
can push the envelope in ways that
otherwise we in industry cannot do so
make sure they they have in them the
ability to try things which otherwise
some of us who've tried as it doesn't
work they don't I'm not jaded by that so
it's important to instill in the
students that then and nothing you do
with job that but the supported to
remember that that didn't push the
envelope because once you hit industry
and the like you're gonna find
constraints you have to shift quickly
yeah there's a deadline etc and you may
forget about what's possible never
forgive us really possible so do you
have any final thoughts again thank you
for the opportunity this is great I hope
you enjoy his class because I'm gonna
actually plan to take it okay I'm not
gonna take it for great okay but I'm
gonna go I want to see it I'm looking
forward to it I think so it's a great
thing are you doing and I wish you luck
well thank you thank you thank you sure
coming in join me and let's thank you so
for being here and sharing your thoughts
with us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
