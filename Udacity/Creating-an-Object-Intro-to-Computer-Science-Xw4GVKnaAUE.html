want to create some objects of that type
and the way to do that is to use the
class name followed by a parameter list
this could be empty but you still need
the prints this is just like when we
call a function so for the restaurant
type we don't need any parameters so
we'll create a restaurant object just
like this this is just like any other
object in Python we can assign it to a
variable if we're doing this outside the
restaurant module we need to import so
what we'll do on our code is use the
from to import from the restaurant
module and we only need to import one
definition it's the definition of the
class restaurant so let's try a few
things in the Python interpreter so
we'll create a new instance of the
restaurant type and we can see that it
has a type it's type is a class named
restaurant that's the type that we just
defined suppose we create another one so
now we have two instances of the
restaurant type they both have the same
type but are they the same object you
should guess before I show you the
result and the result is false they're
not the same object there are two
different objects another way to see
this is to look at their hash hash is a
built-in operator and python that maps
each object to a unique identity here
McDowell's has this fairly meaningless
number you'll get a different number if
you try yourself and the hash of chez
bananas is different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
