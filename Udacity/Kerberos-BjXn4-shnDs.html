authentication and key exchange that we
have discussed are used in actual
systems Kerberos is a standard protocol
used to provide authentication and SS
control in a networked environment
typically an enterprise network every
entity in a network that is all users
and network resources such as
workstations and Printers have a master
key that it shares with the Kerberos
servers and the Kerberos servers perform
both authentication and key distribution
so for convenience we use KDC
to refer to a Kerberos server for human
user the master key is derived from his
or her password for network device the
key is configured in all the keys are
stored securely at the KDC now let's go
over a few typical Kerberos scenarios
when user Bob locks in his work station
counters KDC with the authentication
service request message the KDC
generates a per day session key SB and a
so called ticket granting ticket that
contains SB and idea of Bob and a ticket
is encrypted using the KDC zone key the
KDC then sends back a message to Bob's
workstation and this message is the
authentication service response the
message contains the per day session key
and the ticket granting ticket and the
message is encrypted using the share
master key between Bob and KDC and
because KB is the master key shared
between Bob and KDC only Bob's local
workstation can decrypt this message and
then he can store the per day session
key and a ticket granting ticket
Bob's local workstation will then use SP
for subsequent messages with the KDC and
it would include
the ticket granting ticket to remind and
convince the KDC to use SP that is any
new request to the KDC will include the
TGT in the request message and the new
tickets from the KDC
will be encrypted using SP there are
several benefits with the scheme first
the local host does not need to store
Bob's password a password hash once Bob
has logged in and once he has obtained
SB from the KDC second the master key KB
that Bob shares with the KDC is only
used once every day when Bob locks in
initially that is the exposure of the
master key which is derived from Bob's
password and is subject to possible
guessing attacks is very limited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
