JavaScript and Python are similar to the
differences between American English and
British English sometimes the spelling
changes a bit or the pronunciation
changes a bit but in general they are
mutually intelligible should look very
similar but with one or two extra
letters JavaScript is big on curly
braces Python is big on tabbing
javascript is big on semicolons Python
not so much JavaScript really loves
parenthesis Python I could take them or
leave them
so I thought it could have these could
have these but doesn't have to there's
somewhat optional and in some sense
preferring one over the other is a bit
like preferring Brutus to Caesar I've
heard that Brutus is an honorable man or
at least so Mark Anthony told me they're
both entirely reasonable from our
perspective is this a dagger I see
before me I guess this one must be
Brutus and this one must be Caesar and
you know which one is which because of
these convenient labels so here I've
written a new JavaScript function called
iron Crutchley this one is not recursive
but it takes a formal argument X and
then does some reasoning based on X and
returns values as a result I want to
make sure that you're following along
with JavaScript so I'm going to have you
tell me what this function evaluates to
based on a few different inputs so in
this fill-in-the-blank quiz for each one
of these inputs imagine we're calling
iron Crutchley on 0 so this 0 is bound
to the value of X what would the output
be similarly for 1 2 &amp;amp; 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
