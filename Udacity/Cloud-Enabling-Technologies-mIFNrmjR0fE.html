terms of what a cloud system has to
incorporate several different
technologies come into play first we
already talked about the need for
virtualization this is required in order
to address this ability to provide
fungible resources that can be
dynamically repurposed which application
they serve and then exactly how are they
used what are the expectations you don't
have to have the exact same CPU or the
exact same type of device based on other
customers needs then you need some
technologies to enable the dynamic
provisioning and scheduling of resources
of the infrastructure resources certain
platforms like meses or yarn dupes yarn
that serve this role in order to address
the customers needs for scale cloud
technology need to provide abilities to
process and store a large amounts of
data there are a number of big data
processing frameworks that are out there
Hadoop MapReduce is one Sparx another
one there that is popular regarding the
data storage layer cloud computing
platforms include things like
distributed file systems these are file
systems that typically operate in some
append-only mode where you're not
arbitrarily rewriting data and deleting
data and modifying data and then there
are other important technology that
enable the storage access and
manipulation of data at scale these
include a number of no SQL technologies
which are a departure of traditional
relational SQL databases the ability to
store data across distributed memories
as opposed to repeatedly perform disk
accesses and a number of other
advancements cloud computing customers
do not only need to get the right amount
of resources however they need to
somehow be isolated from each other so
that every one of them thinks that they
own their resource lies for that reason
cloud computing technologies need to
include some kind of mechanism that
enables these software-defined slices of
resources so that customers are provided
with their own software-defined data
center or subset of the story
that's controlled and defined by the
software or the network resource etc and
then also given especially given the
complexity of these environments it's
important for cloud computing platforms
to also use certain efficient monitoring
technologies in real time to process
logs to detect certain anomalies or
failures but also to provide that as a
service to the users that may not just
want some batch access to potentially
large data but more of a real-time or
family interactive access to information
that's produced by from their
applications some of the technologies
that provide this monitoring type
functionality or real-time log
processing include flume and cloud watch
this is the Amazon service or login side
this is something the product that's
part of the VMware portfolium flume is
open source and many many others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
