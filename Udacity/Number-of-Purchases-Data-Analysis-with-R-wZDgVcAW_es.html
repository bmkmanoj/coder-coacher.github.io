noticed this important feature of the
data set but there are also other ways
that by jumping into a different
analysis we might have missed this for
example if we just look at a five number
summary of the data you might not notice
this so easily one clue to the
discreteness is that the 75th percentile
is the same as the maximum we could also
see this discreteness by looking at how
many distinct prices there are in the
data set so here it looks like there's
about 20 different prices tabling the
variable we get an idea of the
distribution like we saw in the
histogram so now that we know something
about the price let's figure out on a
given purchase occasion how many eight
ounce yogurts does a household purchase
to answer this we need to combine the
counts of the different yogurt flavors
into one variable for example for this
particular household on one purchase
occasion they bought three different
types of yogurt to figure this out for
all the households we need to make use
of a new function the function is called
the transform function now I haven't
introduced this function yet but I want
you to look up the function and run the
examples of the code at the bottom of
the documentation to figure out what it
does see if you can create a new
variable called all purchases which
gives the total counts of yogurt for
each observation or household purchase
keep in mind that you need to save this
variable to the data frame so this may
or may not be in your syntax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
