we're going to try and write a potential
energy equation for some particle in the
middle of this electric field here so
let's imagine that we have some particle
with a charge Q in the middle of our
electric field and this particle is a
distance of X away from this negative
plate over here so for this problem you
can assume that the value of Q is
positive so this particle will move to
the right but it turns out when we get
our final answer this choice won't
actually matter all right so now we want
to find out what the potential energy is
for this charged particle in the middle
of the field and just so we're all on
the same page I'm going to define
potential energy to be zero right here
at the negative plate you'll remember
that we can actually define potential
energy to be zero wherever we want so I
could have done it over here or even
over here but just for convenience I'm
going to choose this point to be my
potential energy equals zero point all
right so now can you tell me what's the
formula for finding the potential energy
of this particle in this electric field
now in your answer you can use the
distance between the two plates d the
distance the particle is away from the
negative plate X the charge of the
particle q the mass of the particle m
and the strength of this electric field
e so in your formula you can use any of
these variables but you should only have
to use three of them all right put your
answer here and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
