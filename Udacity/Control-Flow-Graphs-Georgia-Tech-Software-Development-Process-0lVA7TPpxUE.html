a slightly different way by making
something explicit if we go through the
code we can see that the code that's
something in the case of result greater
than zero that's something else if the
result is not greater than zero but is
less than zero and otherwise in the case
in which neither of these two condition
is true nothing really happens so we're
going to make that explicit we're going
to say here otherwise do nothing which
is exactly our problem the code does
nothing in this case what it should do
something so now let's look again in our
test cases let's consider the first one
and I'm going to go a little faster in
this case because we already saw what
happens if we execute the first test
case we get to this point we execute
this statement and then we just jump to
the end as we saw now we if we execute
the second test case we do the same we
get to the else statement the condition
for Devi is true and therefore we
execute this statement and we never
reach this point for either of the test
cases so how can we express this in
order to do that I'm going to introduce
a very useful concept the concept of
control flow graphs a control flow graph
is just a representation for the code
that is very convenient when we want to
reason about the code in its structure
and it's a fairly simple one that
represents statement with nodes and the
flow of control within the code with
edges so here's an example of control
flow graph for this code there is the
entry point of the code right here then
our statement in which we assign the
result of a plus B to variable result
our if statement and as you can see Dave
statement has got two branches coming
out of it
because based on the outcome of this
predicate we will go one way or the
other
in fact normally what we do we will
label this edges accordingly so for
example here we will say that this is
the label that is execute that when the
predicate is true and this is the label
that is executed when the predicate is
false now at this point similar thing
statement five which corresponds to this
one we have another if statement and if
the statement is true then we get to
this point and if it's false we get to
this point so as you can see this graph
represents my code in a much more
intuitive way because I can see right
away where the control flows while I
execute the code so we're going to use
this representation to introduce further
coverage criteria</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
