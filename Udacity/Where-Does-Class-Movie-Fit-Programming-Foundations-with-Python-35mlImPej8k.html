this line of code we will go back in
time and look at a video from a previous
lesson when we were drawing ships for
now you can think of a class as a neatly
packaged box that puts things together
really well and it allows us to write
code like turtle turtle with these
strange-looking brackets as if we were
calling a function in fact when we do
run this piece of code we are in fact
calling a function a function called
init which is defined inside the class
turtle in it stands for initialize and
what it does is it creates space in
memory for a new instance or a new
object of the class turtle this instance
we called Brad okay so we are back to
the present time now we started out by
defining a file called media dot pi let
me place it up on the board notice that
I place this file outside the Python
standard library inside that file we
then define a class called movie after
that we wrote a line of code that said
media dot movie and what I did was that
it called the init function defined
inside class movie and that created a
new instance that instance we called Toy
Story so to summarize this function init
initializes or creates space in memory
for the new instance Toy Story by the
way this function init is also called a
constructor because it constructs space
in memory for the new instance which in
this case happens to be Toy Story so
thus far we have encountered two new
words that we can add to our new word
list the first one is instance which in
this case happens to be Toy Story and
the second one is a constructor which in
this case is the function init now we
will revisit these words soon for now
let's define int</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
