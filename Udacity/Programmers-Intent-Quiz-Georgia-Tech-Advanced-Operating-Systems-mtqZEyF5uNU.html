question let's first discuss a little
bit about the instructions of
architecture of a processor in the
instruction set architecture of a
processor instructions are atomic by
definition or in other words if you
think about reads and writes to memory
which are usually implemented at loads
and stores in the instruction set
architecture of a processor those are
atomic instructions and what that means
is during the execution of either a load
instruction or a store instruction or
also as you might think about them read
or write instruction to memory the
processor cannot be interrupted that's
important that that's the definition of
an of an atomic instruction that the
processor is not going to be interrupted
during the execution of an instruction
now the question that I'm going to ask
you to think about is if I have a
multi-threaded program and in that
program there is a processor p1 which is
modifying a data structure a and there
is a process of p2 that is waiting for
the modification by p1 to be done and
after the modification is done it wants
to use that structure fairly natural to
think about situations in which you have
this kind of a producer-consumer
relationship this guy is the producer of
data this guy is a consumer of data and
the consumer wants to make sure that the
producer is done producing it before he
starts using it quite natural now given
that the instructions of architecture
has only read and write atomic
instructions the question that I'm going
to pose to you is is it possible to
achieve the programmers intent that I
have embodied in this code snippet here
and you know the the answer is a binary
answer yes or no and and if you if you
answer yes I would like to see a code
snippet that you think would make this
particular a code snippet work correctly
on a multiprocessor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
