the unit and what have we learned well
first of all some problems require
search and what I mean by search is you
need to put together a sequence of steps
starting from a start and keep going and
you don't know how many steps it's going
to take and you're trying to optimize
some factor and there are different
kinds of search and we just scratched
the surface believe me it's a gigantic
filled with all sorts of different
algorithms and different types of
applicability for these different
algorithms and there's many
complications we didn't cover but we
covered to the shortest path and the
least cost search and these are two of
the most useful and third search is
really subtle there's lots of possible
problems lurking in there and many that
we didn't even cover yet and so what
that means is where there's subtle tea
there's likely to be bugs and there's
even some bugs where there is no
subtlety that means we have to be
careful and we have these two tools for
combating these bugs one is lots of
tests and the second is standardized
tools that is we work really hard to
make a tool that we know works and got
all the bugs out of it and then we reuse
that tool and part of that reuse is
generalization to look at a specific
problem and say here we solve this
specific problem this way and to
generalize it to say here's part of that
that I think we're going to use over and
over again let's break that out and now
we'll have two parts that solution we
want to be thinking about this specific
problem and we want to be thinking about
the more general problem and we want to
be allocating our work to one or the
other appropriately so congratulations
again you learned a lot of important
concepts and you did a great job in
writing some very complex programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
