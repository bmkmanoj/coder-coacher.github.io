file that gives you the developer the
ability to control how your app appears
to users in areas where they would
normally see apps and more importantly
how it behaves when it's launched from
the home screen it's currently supported
in Chrome and opera with Firefox
actively working on it and it's
currently under consideration for edge
at a minimum the manifest must contain
the name of the app and a short name
this short name is used on the home
screen and in other places where there's
limited space it also needs to start URL
the URL the app should open when
launched from the home screen make sure
the page you specify is cached just part
of the app cell otherwise you won't get
the benefits of a cached app shell and
your app won't work on flying one quick
tip to track the number of users who are
launching your app from their home
screen you can add a query string to the
end of your URL and use any analytics to
track launches with that query string
but don't forget to ensure that you've
cashed the URL with the query string in
your serviceworker
finally we need to provide a set of
icons for things like the homescreen
icon and the tab switcher and the splash
screen the icons parameter takes an
array of icons and must include the
source the size of the icon and the type
for example image Ford / PNG I recommend
providing 8 icon sizes 48 by 48 96 by 96
128 by 128 144 by 144 192 by 192 256 by
256 384 by 384 and finally 512 by 512
this makes sure you have icons for 1x 2x
3x and 4x devices chrome uses the 48
device independent pixel icons for the
home screen icon and the tab switcher
and the 128 device pixel icons for the
splash screen those are the minimum
requirements but
there are a few other helpful things
that you should set in the manifest the
background color and theme color are
used by the browser along with an icon
as part of the splash screen shown the
instant the web app is launched until
its first render once the app is loaded
the theme color tells the browser what
color to tint the UI elements such as
the address bar or the notification tray
display an orientation property give you
control over how the app is displayed
for example you can hide the address bar
and the back and forward buttons by
setting display stand alone or if you're
building a game that works better in
landscape you can force landscape view
by specifying orientation landscape to
save yourself some pain later be sure to
validate the manifest you've created use
the manifest validator linked in the
instructor notes below to make sure that
you've got everything you need and that
it's formatted properly once you've
created a manifest file the browser
needs to know about it to do that add a
link rel equals manifest href equals
manifest jason to the head of each page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
