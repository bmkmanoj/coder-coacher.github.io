addressing in particular we will be
covering ipv4 address structure and
allocation IP stands for Internet
Protocol in version four is the version
of the protocol that is widely deployed
on the Internet to date each IP address
is a 32-bit number and that 32-bit
number is formatted in what is called
dotted quad notation for example the IP
address for WWCC GED u is 132 0 7.7 36
now this is just a convenient way of
writing a 32-bit number so 1:30
represents 8 bits and 2 0 7 is another
8-bit number 7 is another 8-bit number
as is 36 this structure allows for 2 to
the 32 or about 4 billion Internet
addresses now that sounds like a lot of
addresses as it turns out it's actually
not enough and we're running out of IP
addresses as I'll discuss in a later
lesson
but even if we only had to deal with 2
to the 32 Internet addresses that's
still a lot think of if you have to
store every single IP address as an
entry in a table very quickly that
becomes an extremely large table where
lookups can be slow and the memory
required to store such a large table
might be expensive
so what we need is a more concise way of
representing groups of IP addresses
there are different ways to group IP
addresses and we'll look at the
prevailing method in the next part of
the lesson but first let's look at how
this was done
before 1994</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
