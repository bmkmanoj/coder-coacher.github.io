the authentication process is to disable
the password base logins this will force
all of your users to only be able to
login using a key pair to do this you'll
have to edit the configuration file for
sshd which is the service that's running
on the server listening for all of your
SSH connections this configuration file
is located at ET c / ssh / sshd config
and you can edit it using sudo nano
there are a lot of options in here and
you can read through them all to get a
better understanding of how ssh is
configured the comment lines start with
the hash symbol here and they're pretty
good at explaining what everything does
the line we're looking for is right here
password authentication yes we just want
to change that to know and then we'll
save the file now the sshd service is
currently running and it only reads its
configuration file when it's initially
started up so we need to restart the
service so it runs with the new
configuration option we just made we
restart the service by using sudo
service SSH restart and that's all there
is to it now all users will be forced to
log in using a key pair SSH will not
allow users to log in with a username
and password any longer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
