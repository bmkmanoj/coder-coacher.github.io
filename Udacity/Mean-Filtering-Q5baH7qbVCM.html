referred to as mean filtering mean is my
background now instead of just being the
last frame which seems really silly it's
just gonna be the average of the last
end frames that's what it says here
and my background a time T is just the
average of the sum of n frames in the
past okay
in which case then my background my mask
is now I take my current image subtract
off that mean and then is it greater
than a threshold notice we now have a
new parameter right we now have this
parameter in we have to worry about how
much do we average so here's an example
on the same scene of using n as n equal
10 all right so it's average now you'll
see it's kind of a weird thing right so
there's this van that has you know kind
of blended in there all right as it
averages over different places and my
foreground mask looks kind of like this
all right and so I'm getting this
extension of the cars and in a variety
of ways and it's not so great and the
reason that it's not so great is that
the average isn't really the right thing
right so averaging over all those vans
is getting me this kind of weird thing
right now of course if I had averaged
over 50 you know but then I'd have all
these other cars coming through the
average is very sensitive to this what
you can think of is that the background
is just sort of a constant value with
maybe a little variation and
occasionally I get some random
perturbation right some random noise
comes along we've seen this before
remember when we were doing noise
filtering of images and we were using
gaussians etc and then we put in that
like salt-and-pepper noise and we said
salt-and-pepper noise the problem with
it is every now and then you get this
big spike in there and an average will
get torqued around quite a bit by that
so what was the solution to that the
solution to that was to use a median</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
