will need a scanner to read the user
input but right now the code won't
compile it doesn't know what a scanner
is we need to import java.util.scanner
to tell the program where to find the
code for the scanner that's better now
we want to print the prompt and I
remember my colon and space at the end
so that there will be space for the user
input and now i read in the word i'm
going to use next line i'll explain that
in another minute i'll make my book so i
can use it to do the calculations and
now i can calculate the number of
occurrences and print the result in a
nice format let's see if I made any
syntax errors with all that typing sure
enough misspelled occurrences thank
goodness for the compiler you saw this
run before so I won't run it again there
is that one question left over though
the next verses next line let's look at
the documentation if I search for
scanner and Java 7 go to the official
documentation and then search for the
methods here they are there are a lot of
them but here are the ones that start to
be next float and next next bigdecimal
all right the ones that return strings
are next next with a pattern next with
another pattern next line all right and
these look like something else next line
has slightly awkward language advances
this scanner passed the current line and
returns the input that was skipped but
what this means for us is that the
scanner will give us a line of input so
everything the user types before they
hit enter will get loaded in with next
if I find the documentation for next
without the line here's next it says
finds and returns the next complete
token from this scanner what's a
complete token maybe there's more
information so as a complete token is
preceded and followed by input that
matches the delimiter pattern
and then talks about blocking while
waiting for input to scan you don't need
to worry about that part too much
basically it's just saying that it will
wait until the user actually enters
something but this delimiter thing maybe
somewhere on this page it says what the
delimiter is let's look for it using
ctrl f delimiter this looks like it's in
the summary near the top of the page a
scanner breaks us input into tokens
using a delimiter pattern which by
default matches whitespace we saw white
space before that was things like spaces
and tabs that you can't see I guess that
makes sense so it gives you a chunk that
is separated from other things by
something like spaces so it seems like
next would work fine by default if the
user just wanted to search for one word
like Alice but if they wanted to search
for two words like Mad Hatter you would
want to use next line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
