our studio you're welcome to customize
by going to tools and then options from
here you can change the default
directory if you'd like you can change
formatting options for editing code or
you can even change the font and the
appearance here I'm using them tomorrow
theme but there are of course some
others you can also make adjustments to
the panes so feel free to play around
with this to get a configuration that
you like now you might not have any idea
of what you like first so just wait
until you play with our a bit and then
you'll find a configuration that suits
you I'm going to leave this as is
alright we've got our setup so let's
start using the programming language to
get started I want you to download the
our script from the instructor notes and
open it here when you open the file it
should look like this this our script
contains both comments as plain text and
our code you can run our commands by
highlighting a chunk of the code and
then hitting command + Enter on a Mac or
ctrl enter on a PC the lines of text
that start with a hash or a pound symbol
are comments these lines are plain texts
that we don't run around as our code
it's the standalone text that you really
want for the our code now your task is
to read through this file and run and
write code when you're prompted to do so
when you get to the end of the file
you'll get to a question and you'll need
to answer this question to move on to
the next video in this lesson now if
you're already familiar with art I
suggest trying to answer the questions
and then you might want to go back to
the files to see if you miss anything we
know you learn best by doing so it's
important that you execute and run this
code as you go and that you make sense
of the output any output will appear
down here in the console I also hope
that you have moments of inspiration so
if something does come to mind I want
you to code it up and just run it in our
you won't break anything and the worst
thing that would happen would be an
error message or a warning message in
this box if you do happen to get stuck
at any point post in the discussions so
that way your peers or one of the
instructors can help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
