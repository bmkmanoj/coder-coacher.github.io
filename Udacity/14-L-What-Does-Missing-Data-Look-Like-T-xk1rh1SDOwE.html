that could have come from a survey we
can see where each record also known in
statistical speak as an observation has
a number assigned to the survey taker as
well as how they responded to various
questions in the survey for whatever
reasons some of the records or
observations are missing some data we
can see from the data here that they're
basically just blank or empty cells
however depending on where the data is
coming from maybe a database a CSV or
excel file this missing data may take on
different forms for example if the data
comes from a CSV file it might look just
like it does in our initial screen where
the missing data is just blank however
if the data comes from a database you
might actually see it represented as a
null value that's database speak for it
doesn't know what the value is another
way we might see missing data
represented could be as a value n /a
which typically means not available in
programs that we use but regardless of
how it appears we still need to deal
with the fact that we have values in our
data set that are missing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
