office hours for unit 1 thank you all
for participating so far and taking the
class I hope it's been informative for
you so far we're gonna bow that was the
easy stuff so after this unit we're
gonna get into some of the tricky things
so Shawn's found some questions from the
forums that we're gonna go through that
you guys have all had so let's go okay
well the first question is about Google
App Engine and people had a lot of
questions about Google App Engine how it
works how to get running problems they
had whether we are going to need to use
it so I just if we could go over all of
that stuff real okay so so to answer
your question first or to take it from
the top basically we chose Google App
Engine because we thought it would be
the easiest way to get up and running to
get a website online believe it or not
even after reading the forum's I still
believe it's the easiest way to get
something online that said if you don't
want to use it you don't have to all of
the homeworks are gonna be structured
with the same basic format which is
submit a URL that does X so if you can
get a URL online that does X great so if
you want to run this off your local
machine use Apache whatever you're
allowed to do that but I'm going to be
teaching all the lessons using Google
App Engine that'll be what up that's
what I'll be demoing in the class that's
what I'll be working from and that's
generally what I'll be talking about so
the way Google App Engine works yeah is
you're just writing these Python files
and you've got you've got two options of
running and distributing your code you
can either use the launcher program
which it's got a little play button that
allow you to start up your app once once
you add it to the once you add it to the
launcher and that requires you know
Google App Engine itself doesn't ship
with Python you need to have Python
installed on your machine and that seems
to be where a lot of the trouble is
Google App Engine there's two versions
of it one will work with PI 5 to 7 and
want to work with to 5 nothing in this
course requires 2 5 or 2 7 specifically
so just get one of them working and and
and go from there now once you've got
your App Engine your app running locally
then you can either use the launcher to
upload the app or you can use the
console utility personally I use the
console utility you just say
I think appconfig update and then and
you pointed at the directory where your
files are and then it turns for a little
while and then you can go to your you
know account name about a spot comm and
see your app so if you have any specific
troubles post them in the forum other
students have been really helpful with
you know specific submitting answers and
that sort of thing so you know keep
asking keep working at it
this first homework is basically just
get this thing online and I know that
can be a pain on some of your machines
so let's just get this thing online so
we can move you know onward with the
course and if you want to use something
else
knock yourself out we're not gonna be
able help you but you're free to learn
and try try it on your own ok the next
question is from Brian why and he wants
to know what are some useful things to
know about front-end web app development
okay cool so good question because we're
not gonna be spending a whole lot of
time on front-end web app development in
this class the main pieces of technology
you want to know would be JavaScript and
CSS JavaScript is a separate programming
language that runs in the browser and
you serve JavaScript just like you would
serve HTML and you can manipulate your
HTML you can manipulate CSS and that
sort of stuff
Google for JavaScript tutorial and you
will have have plenty of resources to
learn from and CSS that's basically
another type of file you would serve
from your web server and that controls
the styling but the the colors the font
size is the layout of your HTML I'll use
CSS in this class and I'll provide you
you know when we start getting into some
of the more complex website you're going
to be building like when we start doing
the blog stuff a point to where my CSS
is so you can download that and use it
if you want but for the most part you
know the way we're doing the grading on
all of these homeworks is we're gonna
have our own piece of software that's
basically manipulating your website and
it's really hard for us to see if your
website even looks right so the
appearance of things is not something we
can really great anyway but if you if
you have some professional pride and
want to make things look nice javascript
and CSS are the technologies you'll want
to learn and you can use those on your
own if you want to learn this class it's
not going to affect how we agree
homeworks or anything like that so good
question okay
Brian why has a number of additional
questions okay and one of them is is
Google App Engine a good solution for
large-scale projects and are there any
unforeseen difficulties okay
costs involved with that sure well
there's there are costs there are
literal costs you know Google App Engine
is free at a small scale so it'll work
for all of our homeworks but if you want
to run it at a larger scale you've got
to pay for the bandwidth you use and and
how much data you store and that sort of
things I personally haven't used App
Engine in production but udacity.com
itself runs on Udacity so you know many
people do use it in production it's a
great way to get started and the things
I'll be focusing on this class you can
take with you outside of App Engine
I'm basically me talking about
high-level concepts there's a lot of
things that App Engine provides that
will actually be building ourselves so
when we start doing you know user
registration and and cookies and that
sort of stuff we're just going to take
that from the top anyway because I want
you to understand that technologies and
it won't be specific to you know App
Engine or what other other framework
you'd like to use so short answer is yes
you can use it for large-scale projects
I personally don't have a lot of
experience doing that so if you've got
more specific questions hit up the
forums great another question that Brian
White had was what kind of challenges
you ran into when developing Reddit and
Hipmunk okay so that's actually
basically what this whole course is
about so I'm not going to answer that
specifically here I could perhaps do a
seven lecture series about you know
things I learned doing Reddit and
Hipmunk but specifically unit seven is
going to be about those types of
problems unit seven is how to build
websites in the real world and some of
the other things you'll have to think
about how to deal with like large
numbers of users customer service and
all those kind of little things that we
have to think about getting read it off
the ground or getting hit monke off the
ground well spend a whole lot of time
talking about that unit and you know
seven so if you hang with me until then
you'll get your answer okay the next
question is from Heinze and she wants to
know how we're going to be
rated in 101 quizzes weren't rated the
homework was and the final counted for
half I believe and she was wondering
what exactly okay is going to be the
structure of this sure so and in this
class there isn't going to be a final
there are going to be homeworks at the
end of each unit that basically involved
you getting your website online that
does things so the homeworks are the
most important thing if you can pass
those homeworks you know how to build
basic websites and that's the goal of
this class that's what I want you to
leave this class being able to do so the
the in the in lecture quizzes those
don't count towards your grade those are
basically to keep you engaged to keep
you paying attention and to sometimes
introduce some new concepts but those
aren't required the homeworks are so
it's important that you figure those out
and get those online now you don't
actually have to have those homeworks
working each week it's my understanding
that we'll we can test those any times
so the homework due date after which we
will post the solutions but the
solutions aren't going to be you know
when building websites a lot of the
challenges at knowing what code to write
its how to get this thing online how to
get the pieces to fit together so you're
all you're still gonna have to figure
that out and get these things online and
that's where your grade is going to come
from that's it for office hours I want
to thank everybody who's been hanging
out in the forums answering questions
it's been really really helpful I know
this stuff can be frustrating getting
things working Shawn here will be in the
forums to help you know he's kind of my
guy on the ground making sure
everything's going smoothly so hey if
you're stuck hang out in the forums I'll
be an IRC as well if you want to chat
with me during the day
and good luck with the rest of the
course real quick what is the IRC
channel aha where students might not
know that yes okay it's on freenode and
I believe it is pound pound Udacity -
cs2 5-3 and there should be some
information about how to get in there on
the forums so okay great
alright guys good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
