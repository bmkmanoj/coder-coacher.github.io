Zelig says that ABC's can be
used intentionally to change behavior
but we should also be aware that the
ABCs occur in our natural environment
for example let's say you're thirsty
this is a motivation then you see the
refrigerator which is the Q then you
grab a soda and drink it which is the
behavior then your thirst is quenched
and you had something tastes you to
drink which is the consequence because
the consequence was positive this tells
me that I'm more likely to go to the
refrigerator and get a drink when I'm
thirsty however there's another way you
can look at this let's take the same
scenario first say you're thirsty which
is your motivation you see the
refrigerator which is your queue so the
behavior in this scenario is that you
grab milk and drink it but it was sour
milk so the consequence in this scenario
is that you spit out the milk and it was
really gross it didn't quench your
thirst so this is a negative consequence
therefore you're going to be less likely
to go back to the refrigerator and grab
milk in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
