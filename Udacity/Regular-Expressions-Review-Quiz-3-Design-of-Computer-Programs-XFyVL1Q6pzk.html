a star or a question mark that's the
hardest part let's save that for last
now let's consider the final case and
the final case is when we know that the
pattern is not empty and we know that
we've gone through all the special
characters so the first character is is
not a special character except maybe
it's a dot because we haven't dealt with
dot again and so we want to match the
first character and then we want to
match the rest of the pattern whether
that's empty or whether that's something
more so what I'm going to do is invent a
new function that I call match one and
that matches a single character and we
want to return true if that single
character which is the first character
of the pattern matches against the text
and if we can recursively match the rest
of the pattern against the rest of the
text so this is saying we don't have a
special character here except maybe a
dot and so we have like B followed by a
we want to match the B against the text
and then we want to match the a against
something else so fill in for me here
what I should be matching against to
match the rest of the pattern against
the rest of the text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
