programming languages in the story thus
far is that we started with a big web
page that might contain embedded
JavaScript and we did lexing or lexical
analysis to break it up into a list of
tokens and once we had that list of
tokens we did parsing to check those
tokens against a formal grammar and
produce a parse tree more recently we've
learned how to do interpreting to walk
up and down a parse tree with an
environment and figure out what the
final result is supposed to be we have
on call that meaning or semantics in
this unit we're going to put that all
together to build a unified web browser
and it's going to require all the tricks
that we've learned up to this point
including things like how to debug or
what can go wrong if you interpret a
program with an infinite loop let's talk
about the architecture for our web
browser just as engineers or architects
that build buildings in the real world
like to have blueprints or plans or some
notion of how that design is going to
come together we try to do the same
thing in software engineering we want to
have a software architecture a list of
major components and a design that
incorporates all of them our first step
is to find our web page and Lex it and
parse it until we have an abstract
syntax tree most commonly our HTML
interpreter will walk over the abstract
syntax tree that we got from the parsing
and it may find elements in there that
are embedded JavaScript so then we'll
have to call the JavaScript interpreter
on them in most cases at some point the
JavaScript code from the user will call
write or document write and that's that
function that says if I'm in JavaScript
display this on the resulting web page
because the meaning of a JavaScript
program that calls write is that that
text should be displayed
we'll definitely want to store all of
the text from write so that we remember
to include it in the web page later
eventually the JavaScript fragments will
be done executing and we'll be back to
the HTML interpreter which will have
received all of those strings from write
and it will take them plus all of the
normal HTML elements and call the
graphics library to make a pretty
picture of them eventually at the end of
we end up with an image of the webpage
and that's what we wanted from our
simple web browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
