one random variable now assume that I
told you to predict if you are going to
hear thunder or not
well that's very difficult but what if I
tell you if it is raining or not your
guess regarding the Thunder is going to
be significantly better so there is some
information in this variable that tells
you something about this variable we can
measure that in two different ways the
first one is called as joint entropy a
joint entropy is the randomness
contained in two variables together as
given by H of X comma Y and as you can
predict it is given by this particular
formula which is the joint probability
distribution between x and y and as you
predicted it is given by this particular
formula where P of X comma Y is the
joint probability of x and y the other
measure is called as conditional entropy
condition entropy is a measure of the
randomness of one variable given the
other variable and it is denoted by H of
Y given X now to understand these two
concepts you have to imagine what
happens when x and y are independent if
x and y are independent then the
conditional probability of Y given X is
just the conditional probability of Y
it's quite obvious right if two
variables are independent of each other
Y variable doesn't get any information
from X at all the joint entropy between
x and y if x and y are independent is
the sum of information of both x and y
that is why the entropies have have been
added here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
