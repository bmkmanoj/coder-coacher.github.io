three remaining problematic enrollments
I printed out all of them however this
time when I looked at the records I
wasn't really sure what the problem was
I ended up asking a Udacity data
scientist if he knew what was going
wrong he pointed out that these students
were all Udacity test accounts which he
could tell because they had is Udacity
equal to true these test accounts aren't
guaranteed to be present in the daily
engagement table this is really good to
know I should also probably be excluding
any test accounts from my analysis
anyway at this point there weren't any
more surprising data points I did go
ahead and remove all the Udacity test
accounts from the data right away since
I didn't plan to include them in any
future analysis first I created a set of
all the Udacity test accounts by looping
over the enrollment data and I found
that there were six of them in this data
set then i wrote a function to remove
any data associated with those accounts
finally I called my function on all
three of my tables and then checked how
many records were left in each most of
the data is still included which is what
I expected I did create new variables
for the updated data just in case I ever
want to look at the original data again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
