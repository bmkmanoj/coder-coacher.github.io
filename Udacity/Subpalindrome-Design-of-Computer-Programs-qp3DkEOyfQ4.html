the sub palindrome problem now if you
took 101 you saw that a palindrome is a
string that reads the same forwards as
it does backwards so our a dar are a dar
and we're going to allow palindromes
where the case of the letters can be
different so this would be a good
palindrome even though there's a capital
R here and a lowercase R there now some
people allow palindromes where the
spaces and punctuation don't count so
you can throw them in anywhere we're not
going to allow that we're going to only
allow cases where there's an exact match
so this would be a palindrome it has
spaces but there they read the same
forwards and backwards so that's a good
one and this would not be a palindrome
because the space does not occur in the
same place forward and backwards now now
you know what a palindrome is but the
problem is to find a sub palindrome so
here's a string we want to find the
longest palindrome and turns out that it
occurs from here to here now how would
you find that well there's one obvious
way to do it is to try every possible
substring so try every starting location
here here here and so on and every
ending location the string W by itself
wh wh e and then H by itself heh ER and
so on try every single one and check to
see if they're a palindrome now that
would work but it would be slow if there
are n characters in the string then
there's n starting locations and n
ending locations and each of those
substrings can have up to end characters
so to check all of them out would be an
order n cubed operation there be roughly
n cubed checks that you have to make to
see if two characters are the same what
we're asking you to do is to come up
with a solution that's faster than that
that takes in the worst case roughly and
squared rather than n cubed comparisons
and in most cases will do better now
when I say operations here what do I
count as an operation I
to write your routine so that all you do
is pick out characters so we pass you in
a text and you pick out a character text
sub I tech sub J and then you can do
anything you want with the characters
you pick out you can convert them to
uppercase to make it easier to compare
if they're the same you can compare two
characters all those operations will be
free but we'll be counting how many of
these operations you do now the trick is
to find a good way to go through the
text and look at the characters I'm
going to tell you a bad way to enumerate
through them and you're going to have to
come up with a good way let's say that
we knew that text from I to J is a
palindrome maybe that's ABC be a if we
then said let's try to expand this text
and look at the next two characters we
could do that test but we wouldn't have
learned anything about whether or not
this is a palindrome given that this is
a palindrome we'd have to do the whole
test all over again so we haven't gained
any advantage from what we know about a
partial result to expand it to a bigger
result so what we want to do is find
some way of saying I know something
about palindrome somewhere in this
string and that's going to tell me it's
going to help me more efficiently figure
out a bigger piece of the string that's
what you've been asked to do we're going
to call our function longest sub
palindrome slice slice meaning what I
want you to return is the I and J
indices of the start and the end and J
should be one character after the end so
the same conventions that we use
normally in Python such that text sub IJ
is the longest palindrome why did I
return the indices rather than the text
itself because you might be interested
in wherein the text the palindrome
occurs and if you have I and J it's easy
to pull out the actual palindrome but if
i give you the actual palindrome it's
harder to find where it occurs so here
what i'm doing is i'm making an
abbreviation for this function so
longest sub palindrome slice that's just
a variable which names a function and
now i'm just assigning another variable
l to be equal to that so now these to
refer to the same function
and I can go ahead and do that and I can
fit more tests on one line by using the
shorter name rather than the longer name
so write your function so that all the
tests passed add any other tests you
think are useful and make sure you do it
through an efficient recurrence relation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
