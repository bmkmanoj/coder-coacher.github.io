process and I just like to hear whether
you enjoyed it or whether you think it
was useful with authority what are your
thoughts I was very interesting I not
only learned something about computers
and about how you design information
systems in UML but I it was interesting
I also learned something interesting
about the library and things that that I
knew but I'd never really explicitly
written down came up during the course
of doing this and I think I now much
better understand what this information
system that you're going to build for us
is really really all about ok well I
mean I'm very happy that you said that
because I really believe that you know
doing this kind of analysis and design
exercises really helps you figuring out
whether there's any issues with the
requirements so for example you can find
out whether there's any missing
information or maybe conflicting
information and I think that's exactly
what happened today so I'm very glad to
hear that it worked for you that you
enjoyed it I hope you enjoyed it as well
and I strongly encourage you to do this
kind of exercises for different kinds of
systems so that you can become more
familiar with analysis and design
techniques so any final thoughts I look
forward to receiving your delivered
software all right we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
