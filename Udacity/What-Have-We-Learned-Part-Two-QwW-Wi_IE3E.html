predictive state representation yes
indeed and the upshot of the PSR idea
was what well that rather than thinking
about stage which might not even exist
anyway they do exist you never know
where you're in them or not so really
they don't exist in some very important
insane potato sort of way what does make
sense to think about is whether there
are specific tests that you could take
that would then predict what you're
likely to observe and that in some sense
that's it's a very satisfying way of
thinking about the world that I need to
kind of keep track of well if I were to
do certain things now what would happen
and that was kind of the push for sort
of PSRs and insofar as you prefer that
kind of way of thinking about the world
the nice thing is that PSRs can
represent any poverty p and so they're
equivalent right except maybe more
palatable philosophically or so forth
certain certainly rich Sutton was was
pushing people in the direction of this
representation for that reason there's a
kind of philosophical stance that says
you know am I sick what what does it
mean to be sick it means that I you know
could be dead tomorrow could be stuck in
bed tomorrow I could be running a fever
it's like there's a bunch of observable
things that are a function of what the
current state is and so it might be
useful to talk about things in terms of
what those predictions are as opposed to
positing some kind of magical internal
state well this makes sense right
because the only usefulness if you go
back to that and we talked about this on
our last machine learning course you
know in some sense the only usefulness
of a state is what it allows you to
predict about what's going to happen
next little made of objects so the only
reason it's worthwhile even recognizing
something as a state is it allows me to
distinguish between something else that
might be important later so right so
another one of our you know universal
contradictory truths is that states and
predictors are kind of the same thing
yeah all things are the same excellent
all right so I think that's the the last
lesson that I was doing by myself I
think I'm going to turn it over to you
for the next one well I will point out
that none of this by yourself like we've
done this together yes that's fair all
right well with that I guess we should
say goodbye all right see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
