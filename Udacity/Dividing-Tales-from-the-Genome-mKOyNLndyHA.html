body several trillion to be exact and
all cells in your body had to divide at
some point in their lives because cell
division is part of the cell replication
process where one cell will actually end
up dividing into two daughter cells and
so for us to understand how the DNA gets
passed down to these daughter cells we
need to understand a bit more about this
whole process in general now we've
learned already that every cell has 46
chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs each
chromosome exists in a pair and half
that pair came from mom and half that
pair came from dad let's say I'm
heterozygous for the trade of lactose
metabolism what this means is I have one
chromosome with a dominant allele for
lactase persistence and I have another
chromosome with a recessive allele for
lactase non persistence so this means
that this cell and every other cell in
my body is heterozygous this means that
every cell has one copy of the dominant
allele for lactase persistence that has
the ability to continue acctaste
expression into adulthood if we assume
that there's not any DNA duplication
before cell division how many
chromosomes would each of these daughter
cells receive and assume in even or
equal division in this process even
though there's no DNA duplication go
ahead and put the number you think in
this box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
