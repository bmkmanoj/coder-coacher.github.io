have a European ancestry background
which didn't surprise you too much but I
really like to know about your paternal
line so from your Y chromosome do you
mind logging in and showing us what it
looks like no not at all show us were to
navigate to get to this information um
so basically you go to my results and
then you go to under ancestry overview
you go to paternal line so what does it
say what are you i am r 1 b 1 b 2 a 1 a
2 F 2 as a mouthful it is which is a
subgroup of R 1 B 1 B 2 and so where is
this from where does this take us um it
says that around 500 years ago before
the era of intercontinental travel I was
predominantly from the southern European
area it looks like there are some spots
other places to like maybe even less
alike the Middle East and some western
parts of Asia right um does this is what
you expected did you expect anything
this is surprising it's a little
surprising i mean i thought like both my
maternal and paternal line would be
primarily all from the northern european
sections but this is showing the
southern European section with a lot of
spread out into other areas so what
kinds of populations does that say this
Y chromosome pichardo line half a group
are part of it so if you look over here
it says that the populations are Irish
Basque British and French</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
