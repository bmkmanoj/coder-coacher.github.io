important technique for cube maps up to
this point the techniques described two
views cube maps created in advance in
fact the GPU is plenty powerful enough
to make cube maps on the fly look at
this demo carefully what's great about
it is that the shiny not figure and cube
are reflected in the sphere changing
position every frame the way this is
done is to make a cube map from the
viewpoint of the spheres position the
spheres center in each face of the cube
map forms a view frustum you render the
scene 6 times 1 for each cube face and
each rendering is then used for the new
cube face the sphere itself is not
rendered into the cube map after the
cube map is rendered it's immediately
applied to all the objects in the scene
the cube map includes the knot and block
in it so you can see these reflected in
the sphere the exact reflection is not
precisely right but close enough that we
accept it as correct for efficiency the
same map is used on the nod and block
objects but the reflections are so
distorted that we don't notice that the
environment map is incorrect that it
includes two objects and not the third
notice how this demo is recursive in
nature the objects reflected are also
reflective each object when rendered is
using the previous frames environment
map on it so they all look reflective i
recommend toying with this demo and
changing objects and materials to see
how it changes what you see this
technique of generating cube maps on the
fly is popular in racing games for
example the car is removed from the
scene and the rest of the environment is
rendered to the cube map which is then
applied to the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
