quickly realized that there was one
small issue that he hadn't dealt with
yet he had that a chance to think about
how much his products should cost I
randomly picked the numbers five dollars
for wipers and three dollars for a
nozzle but he's probably going to want
to make a little bit more money than
that for some reason his friends who had
promised to buy his products didn't seem
particularly worried about how much they
would cost but he wanted to get closer
to crunching some numbers so he could
figure out what kind of fortune his
gleaming glasses products would give him
so right now we have this very general
equation that we came up with in the
last quiz for the total amount of money
that grants going to make but as you can
see there aren't any numbers in this yet
what we want to do is get the actual
price of each product to be involved in
this equation in some way so what other
information do we already have about
this situation well we learned that
thirty-six people want to buy glasses
wipers we also know that eleven people
each want two nozzles what we don't know
yet is the price that grant should set
for each product a set of wipers and one
nozzle similar to what we did before
let's pick one variable to represent the
cost per wiper set and another variable
to represent the cost per nozzle I think
I'll pick W to represent the cost per
wiper set and I'll pick n to represent
the price per nozzle looking back up at
this equation we came up with in the
last quiz let's just start by focusing
on the amount of money that grants going
to earn from selling wiper sets so for
now we're just going to ignore the part
of the equation about the nozzles so
which of these expressions down here do
you think should replace this question
work how much money is grant going to
earn from selling wipers to thirty-six
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
