going to be a useful step here which is
we're going to take advantage of the
fact that minus epsilon is greater than
or equal to the natural log of 1 minus
epsilon which maybe is not so obvious
but if you plot it you can see that it's
true if this is the epsilon axis then
minus Epsilon looks like a straight line
going down like that sure it's got slope
minus 1 yep and the log of 1 minus
epsilon looks like this it starts off
there they're totally lined up at 0 at
epsilon 0 sure because 1 minus 0 is 1
the natural log of 1 is 0
exactly and then what happens is it
starts to fall away from it the slope is
actually I mean you could you can test
this by taking the derivative of it but
the slope is if you know it's
monotonically you know changing this way
so that it falls away from the line it
always stays below it ok so if we
believe that which you know I'm gonna
just say calculus well you can kind of
see that right because when epsilon is 1
that would be the natural log of 0 and
the only way you can raise e to a power
and get 0 is by having effectively
negative infinity yeah so right by then
there it's definitely below and but it
stays below all along I mean cuz just
that it's not enough because well it has
to stay below all along because natural
long is the natural log is a monotonic
function right so it can't like get
bigger and they get smaller again so
yeah ok I buy that good alright so if
that's the case if we accept this line
then it's also going to be the case that
1 minus epsilon to the M is less than or
equal to e to the minus epsilon M so why
is that so if you multiply both sides by
M and then take e to the both sides you
get exactly this expression sure all
right so now that we've gotten that we
can use it here in our derivation and
rewrite that as the size of the
hypothesis space times e to the minus
epsilon M right that gives us another
upper bound on the quantities that we
had before and this is much more
convenient to work with the epsilon
which had been kind of trapped in the
parentheses with the 1 minus now comes
up to the exponent where we can work
with it better sure all right so what
this is is an upper bound that the
version space is not
epsilon exhausted after M samples hmm
and that is what we would like Delta to
we would like Delta to be abound on that
right so the Delta is the is the failure
probability essentially so the failure
probability ought to be bigger than or
equal to this expression here okay
so now the last thing we need to do is
we can just rewrite this in terms of M
mmm so if we do that let's see what
happens all right so we're done
rewriting that what we find is the
sample size M needs to be at least as
large as one over epsilon times the
quantity the log of the size of the
hypothesis space plus the log of one
over Delta okay and that is polynomial
in one over epsilon one over Delta and
the size of the hypothesis space
indeed nice so that's pretty cool so so
right so we it tells us if you know the
size of the hypothesis space and you
know what your epsilon and Delta targets
are you know sample a bunch and then
you'll be okay that's pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
