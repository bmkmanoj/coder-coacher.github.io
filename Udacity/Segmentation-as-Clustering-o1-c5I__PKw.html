is clustering and we've been using some
feature space based upon color and then
we have these different algorithms one
of the challenges is is that things like
just color or the brightness or position
which is something else we looked at
alone are not enough to do segmentation
and here are some examples so you can
see that you know generally in this area
here the colors are about the same as
this area there likewise the brightness
here the average brightness is the same
as the brightness over there now you
have no problem seeing the differences
between these but that's because you
just don't use brightness position color
you also use texture right obviously the
texture here is different than the
texture there likewise on the phone the
texture there is quite different than
the texture here so the question is how
would we introduce some some measure
that was sensitive to texture into our
segmentation one way of thinking about
texture is this so here I have this
picture and and I've got clearly
different texture here than I do here
and I do there alright so here is one
approach let's compute a series of
filter outputs so here's a one two three
four or five so 24 it says 24 right
there here's 24 different filters okay
and they may have different orientation
so here we get different orientations
and they have different scales so they
go from coarser scale to a finer scale
and here's ones that are just sort of
little center-surround it almost doesn't
matter well it does matter but it almost
doesn't matter which filters you use the
idea is that you're creating a new set
of dimensions that you'll have for every
point right and when you do that the
idea is that hopefully along these
different dimensions and there's 24 of
them however many you have you would get
some clusters depending upon the types
of textures that you have in your image
and that's what's being shown here right
is you have these clusters in this image
space alright and so here's an example
of using let's just suppose we take a
look at this is the derivative
in the x-direction so how much gradient
there is going in the x-direction at one
particular scale this is one of the
dimensions and this is in the y
direction so it's your measure gradient
in the Y direction and the idea is that
well in this case there are little areas
that have in this case windows that
primarily have vertical edges right
because they've got strong X gradient
and no y gradients
likewise here's horizontal this has a
little window that would have a texture
in both of them and these would be areas
that have hardly any gradient at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
