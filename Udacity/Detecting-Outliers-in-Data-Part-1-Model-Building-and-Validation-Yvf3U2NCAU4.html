parametric models using kernel density
estimation we can also ask the question
are there outliers in the data the
Mahalanobis distance for a single
variable X can be defined this way where
mu X is the mean value for x and s is
the covariance matrix we use the inverse
of s here to get this product matrix
similarly for two identically
distributed variables x and y we take
the difference transpose and use the
cove inverse of the covariance matrix
and then the difference and multiply
them together in both cases the values
are always positive definite since it's
a true distance function the Mahalanobis
distance gives us a simple way to look
for outliers in the data the square of
the mahalanobis distance in two
dimensions or with two variables is
equal to the chi-square with two degrees
of freedom thus that distance directly
give us how far these values of data are
from their central tendencies in the
probability distributions in our case we
had two distributions of f1 and f2 f one
was the average Medicare payment amount
and f2 was the average Medicare allowed
amount we had inspected these two
distributions and they seemed to be
quite identically distributed assuming
they were identically distributed given
that f1 and f2 were quite identically
distributed we had the derived variables
X and X bar identically distributed can
we look for outliers in a Joint
Distribution of X and X bar moreover if
we do find outliers using the
Mahalanobis distance we can still ask
the question what do these outliers mean
well we will leave it up to you to find
what the meaning of these outliers could
be let's go
back to the ipython notebook and
implement the code for the mahalanobis
distance and see if we can find some
outliers in our variables X and X bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
