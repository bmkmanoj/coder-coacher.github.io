search engine you've got all the
components that you need for a search
engine you've got a way to collect a
corpus using a web crawler that you
built in the first three units in units
four and five you've figured out and
hopefully understood how to build the
index and then how to make it faster in
unit five and in unit six what we've
just finished you've figured out how to
rank the results there's one little bit
left we haven't used those ranks so one
of the questions on your homework will
be using the ranks to get the best
result if we want to get the best result
just having the dictionary of ranks is
not enough we need to use that to find
the result that matches the query that
has the best rank and that's one of the
questions that you'll do on the homework
for this unit there are a lot of other
hard problems so you have a few problems
left to solve before you can build a
search engine that will compete with
Google probably the hardest one you've
got to come up with a name this is
really hard you could try you'll you
could try duck-duck find none of those
really work you'll have to come up with
a better name and this is a pretty tough
problem make sure it also talked to your
trademark lawyers another thing you'd
like to be able to do is actually get
your search engine on the web so other
people can send queries to it that's not
something we're going to cover in this
class but if you take the web
applications course that will start
shortly after this class finishes you'll
learn a lot about how to build web
applications and be able to do that so
congratulations you've reached the end
of unit six and this is actually the
last technical content that will be in
this course unit seven will get you
ready for the final exam and we'll give
you some interesting examples of using
computing in context so congratulations
you've now finished building a search
engine and it actually does page ranking
better than any search engine that
existed before 1998 that's quite amazing
I first won it also congratulate David
for getting you to this point I think
that's that's quite amazing honestly
he's put a lot of sleepless nights into
this but also one tell you you guys are
my heroes you got to a point where it's
something I think really significant in
this class you actually learned how to
and you programmed your own search
engine now I have to say I'm a little
bit jealous when I was a student at
college there was no search engines and
I wasn't even ability for me to learn
all this stuff so you've been
for the ability to learn the stuff but
then you really got an amazing speed
here there's something really really
significant I hope I mean if you keep up
that speed and keep improving yourself
at that same speed and learn new things
maybe in 3 4 years you are the next
Google that would be really amazing well
I think you're definitely on track to
doing that and I hope you'll take some
of the courses that will start offering
as 200 level courses and more advanced
courses later this is the end of unit 6
we're not going to have any more
technical content in the course unit 7
is going to be all field trips and
interviews giving you some idea of how
the things that you've learned in class
fit into context and that should be a
lot of fun the other thing that you'll
have as part of unit 7 is the final exam
and I hope everyone enjoys homework 6
and we ready for the final next week and
I hope you enjoy the final exam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
