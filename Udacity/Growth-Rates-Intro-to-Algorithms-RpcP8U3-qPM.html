formula to give us a handle on how fast
edges grow relative to the number of
nodes in a planar graph we're gonna make
use of two other facts
one is that every region in a planar
graph has to be encapsulated has to be
bounded by at least three edges for it
to be a region so it might be more than
that but it has to be at least three so
if you think about three times the
number of regions the number of edges
has to be at least that big though we're
counting each edge twice because each
edge can actually participate in two
regions so twice the number of edges has
to be bigger than or equal to three
times a number of regions so rewriting
Euler's formula we have this we were
writing this equation this substituting
in we have this let's multiply through
by 3 I get 3 M plus 6 is less than or
equal to 3 n plus 2 M tracked em from
both sides and subtract 6 from both
sides and we get M the number of edges
can't be any bigger than 3 n minus 6
which this expression is in big theta of
n so the most edges that we can have in
a planar graph is at most linear in the
number of notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
