haven't talked about his actual product
that much I think it's time that least
discussed some of the specifics of wiper
blade engineering now in general grant
aims to have his wiper blades be exactly
2.5 centimeters long please note that
this drawing is not to scale however in
the manufacturing process things aren't
perfect to acknowledge that Grant has
created a tolerance range that wiper
length is allowed to me as long as the
wiper is within three millimeters of
this total length at a three millimeters
longer or three millimeters shorter then
it's acceptable and can be put on the
market let's call the blade length in
centimeters of a given y / x what we're
really concerned with then is the
difference between X the blade length
and 2.5 centimeters the target blade
length if X is longer than 2.5
centimeters they want the difference
between x and 2.5 centimeters to be less
than or equal to 0 point 3 centimeters
which is the same as 3 millimeters
however if X is shorter than 2.5
centimeters they want the difference
between X and 2.5 to be greater than or
equal to negative 0 point 3 since X
could be something like 2.4 if it's
shorter and 2.4 miles 2.5 is negative
point 1 which is greater than equal to
negative point 3 taking into account all
the possible values of x we want both of
these things to be true so we need to
insert an and between these two values
if we were to show this range of values
for X minus 2.5 on a number line you
would get this the region is just like
shown in our inequalities symmetric
about 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
