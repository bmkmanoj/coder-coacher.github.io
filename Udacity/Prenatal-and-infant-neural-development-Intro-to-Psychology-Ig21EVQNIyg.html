brain that are pretty mind-blowing first
our brain is about 25% of its adult size
when we're born on the other hand our
bodies are only about 5% of the adult
size when were born as humans we have
really big brains and this is both why
we're helpless when we're born but also
why we have such a capacity for learning
the brain isn't fully wired at birth we
only have a few instincts when we were
born such as suckling which is needed
for feeding so we need experience to
shape our brain and that's exactly what
experience does it physically changes
our brain
now the second cool fact is how many
neurons grow inside of the brain of a
fetus during prenatal neural growth new
neurons grow an amazing rate of 250,000
neurons per minute
and this is during the final stage of
fetal development now this amazing rate
of neural growth continues into the
first 18 to 24 months of life now even
though our brain grows and changes
throughout life due to experiences such
as learning or exercising even eating
different things the rate of change does
slow over time and just because we have
all of these neurons doesn't mean we
necessarily use all of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
