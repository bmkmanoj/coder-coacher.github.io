of what layer blocks is so layer blocks
is a software generator for generating
different variants of products in the
same product line so you want to be able
to generate all of these these variants
how how how does your generator actually
work what does it take its input and and
and and and how does it process that
that's a good question so i should say
first off that our generator is based on
a pretty well understood idea from
software engineering that goes back to
it really goes back to the early 90s on
product line generation and so each
variant that we want to generate as a
different program in the same product
line and we we organize our product
lines in terms of reusable features that
we put into a library we've designed
them according to a design idiom that
makes them very composable with one
another which I'll demonstrate here in a
little while and what to do then to
degenerate a variant is you write
something called an assembly
specification assembly specification
explains how you put these features
together in some novel combination to
generate a particular variant and it has
some particular useful properties which
I think we'll be able to dig into by
example here in a few minutes but what's
really nice about it is the features you
can write once and reuse many times and
you can very easily understand by virtue
of comparing these assembly
specifications how two different
variants in the same product line are
common and how they differ and be very
precise about that and I'm curious about
the title layer blocks is it is this
related to layered architectures it is
it is when you see some examples of
assembly specifications you'll see that
the the components that we're generating
each component when I see use the term
variant I mean program or component so
the when you see how a given component
is generated you'll notice that it's the
little program you write to say how to
generator the recipe looks is a very
layered very hierarchical
it's related to layered architectures in
another way to in the sense that
typically layered architectures you tend
to think of software built in stacks
where you can understand a layer you can
understand one layer just in terms of
the interface that it exports without
any knowledge of how its implemented or
of the layers that are underneath it the
assembly specifications that we write
using layer box have that same property
and and just to clarify a bit the layers
that you're talking about our and the
generated code you're talking about they
go in that middle tier no they actually
in this case they could go in the middle
tier but in this case they go and down
on the data tier okay so that the
tiering is kind of independent of the of
the layering that's correct that's
correct and in the diagram there's also
this usable feature library can you say
a word about that so you know I
mentioned earlier than we have a number
of different clients their programs and
their applications are very similar but
they're not exactly the same what we
found is that if we do a decomposition a
design of our software by feature and I
know you guys have spoken of feature
diagrams and feature modeling in the
past when you when you when you do a
feature based design you actually can
get reusable pieces of their not whole
applications they're little fragments
but but they're highly reusable and
composable in ways that you can put them
together to make different variants of a
of the same application very easily so
we did a four in the example we'll see
we basically did a feature analysis to
understand what are the different
features that are put together to do
forecasting and based on that feature
analysis we we designed our reusable
features around it and got this ability
to compose them in this very very nice
way so the unit of variation is a kind
of a customer visible feature it may not
be customer visible and ideally it could
be right and in other product line work
it is the unit of visible the unit is
customer visible feature in our case
it's more implementation centric but but
still it's much more on the science side
than then the customer side so in our
case we're doing forecasting and there's
some pretty calm
complicated algorithmics that go with
with forecasting so that domain is the
domain at which we've we've done the
feature analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
