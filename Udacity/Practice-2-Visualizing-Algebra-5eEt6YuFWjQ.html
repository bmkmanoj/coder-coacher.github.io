97 well let's see how we got 97 whenever
I see an equation with fractions in it
the first thing that I want to do is get
rid of the fractions because I don't
want to have to add subtract multiply
and divide fractions all the way through
solving the problem to clear the
fractions out of an equation I look at
all the denominators which I have six
two and three and I have to find the
least common denominator because i want
to multiply the entire equation through
by the least common denominator at least
common denominator of three two and six
is six so i'm going to multiply the
entire equation through by six i have to
multiply six by each term that is in the
equation i'm going to write the steps
out here but once you get comfortable
you can feel free to skip this step so i
have six times one-third and one-third
is being multiplied by two x minus one
on the right side of the equation i have
six times negative one half x plus six
times seven sixths when i multiply six
times one-third i get six times
one-third is 6 over 3 which gives me too
and that's going to be x two x minus one
on the right side of the equation i have
6 times negative one-half x 6 over 2 is
3 so i have negative 3x when i multiply
six times seven sixths the sixes cancel
out and I'm just left with the seven
once I clear the fractions from the
equation I need to distribute wherever
needed here i have 2 times 2x minus 1 so
i need 2 times 2x and i need two times
negative 1 to x 2 x is 4x + 2 times
negative 1 is negative 2 and i just
write down the other side of my equation
once I've cleared the grouping symbols
and distributed where needed I would
combine like terms on each side of the
equation however here there's only one x
term and one constant term on the left
side and 1 X term and one constant term
on the right side the next step is to
move all my constants to one side of the
equation we learn that whatever you do
to one side of the equation you have to
do to the other side of the equation so
if I add 3x on this side I have to add
3x on this side when I add 3x to both
sides i have 4x + 3 x gives me
an X minus 2 equals negative 3x plus 3 x
is 0 so I just have seven now that I
have the variable on one side of the
equation I need to move the constant to
the other side of the equation when I
add 2 to both sides of the equation i
get 7x on the left side negative two
plus two is zero and I get 7 plus 2
which equals 9 on the right side so I
have 7x equals 9 the last step is to
divide both sides of the equation
through by the coefficient of the
variable the coefficient of the variable
is 7 so i divide both sides by 7 7 over
7 is 1 so i have x equals 97 solving an
equation with fractions in it is a
little bit more difficult but if we
simply multiply through by the least
common denominator all the fractions
disappear and you're left with a simpler
problem to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
