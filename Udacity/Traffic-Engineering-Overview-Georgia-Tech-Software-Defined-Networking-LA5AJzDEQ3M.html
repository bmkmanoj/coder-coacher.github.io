actually fundamentally insecure many
explicit design choices have caused the
internet to be vulnerable to different
types of attacks the internet was
designed for simplicity and as a result
security was not a primary consideration
when the internet was originally
designed another aspect of the
Internet's design is that it's on by
default in other words when a host is
connected to the Internet it is by
default reachable by any other host that
has a public IP address this means that
if one has an unsecure host that host is
effectively wide open to attack by other
hosts on the internet now this wasn't a
primary design consideration when the
internet consisted of a small number of
trusted networks but as the Internet has
continued to grow this on by default
design or the notion that any host
should always be reachable by any other
host has come under fire part of the
reason that the on by default model does
not work that well is that hosts are
insecure this makes it possible for a
remote attacker to compromise a machine
that's connected to the Internet and
commandeer it for the purposes of attack
in many cases an attack might actually
just look like normal traffic for
example in the case of an attack on a
victim web server every individual
requests to that web server might look
normal but the collection of requests
together mounted as part of a
distributed denial of service attack
might add up to a volume of traffic that
the server is unable to handle finally
the Internet's federated design
obstructs cooperation for diagnosis or
mitigation in other words because the
internet is run by tens of thousands of
independently operated networks it can
be very difficult to coordinate the
defense against an attack because each
of these networks is run by different
network operators sometimes in
completely different countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
