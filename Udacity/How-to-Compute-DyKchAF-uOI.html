want to be able to create a discrete
inverse response function from the data
and we refer to this as let's say G of Z
and what we're basically interested in
for each pixel site and I just showed
you three in the last image an image J I
just showed you five and I basically
showed the plot was for about 15 of them
for each pixel site and we can choose a
few good number of them and all of the
images we will compute the values and
again we do this I mean log here of both
the exposures and a time and to compute
a function G Z I mean doing in this log
allows us to do addition otherwise
remember we would be doing this as a
multiplication of course what we have
now is a over determinant linear system
for n pixels over P different exposure
images so again we have P different
exposure images and we have n pixels we
basically started off with I site pixel
I and image a and now of course we have
a number of pixels that we want to
measure and the number of exposures
remember last time we basically showed
five we had 15 and I had three points so
n was 3 and p was 15 to create those
plots now of course what we can do now
is create a system of linear equations
log of the exposure log of the time
itself and then basically subtracting by
this and this basically lets us do you
know least square differences of course
what we basically now do is come up with
a fitting term and a smoothness term
this is the kind of way we basically
solve these types of linear optimization
problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
