performance quiz we have a one megabyte
array that we are reading one byte at a
time one megabyte is to 2 xx bytes our
page is 4 kilobytes which is 2 to the 12
so there are 256 pages in this array now
what happens is once you have the first
axis you will have a level one TLB miss
in level two TLB miss and the
translation will be generated and placed
in both the elby's next when we access
the second byte we have a TLB hit
because that byte is in the same page as
the previous one so after the first Miss
we will have hits for the remainder of
the 4 kilobyte page in the first sweep
we will have 256 l1 TLB misses because
that's how many pages we accessed and we
will have 4095 this is 1 less than 4
kilobytes times 256 TLB hits at level 1
after this first sweep the level one TLB
contains the entries for the second half
of the array because the array needs 256
pages we only have a hundred
twenty-eight entries the level two TLB
however contains the mappings for the
entire array because it still has enough
elements to hold them so what's going to
happen after the first sweep is the
level one TLB will continue doing this
256 hits and this many misses each time
we sweep but the level two TLB will
start hitting all the time so what we
have is ten times 256 misses here and
ten times 4095
times 256 hits here now the question is
for l2 what do we have we know that we
will have 256 misses that is because
during the first sweep we have no
mappings for any of the 256 pages after
the first sweep
we'll have the mapping for all the pages
so it will only have hits but the
question is how many of them well note
that we only access the level two TLB if
we have a Miss in the level one TLB so
the number of hits here will be this
minus this so for nine sweeps we will be
having these misses go here and big hits
so this is the answer to this quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
