me show you what the brain is made of
the cerebrum is the uppermost portion of
the brain it's also the largest part of
the brain covering about two-thirds of
the whole brain mass and it's divided
into two main hemispheres now the outer
layer of the cerebrum
is called the cerebral cortex
interestingly it's only about 1/10 or
1/5 of an inch thick however even though
it's really small this is where much of
our human thoughts planning perception
and consciousness take place the frontal
lobe in the front of the brain of course
makes up about 1/3 of the area of the
cerebral cortex it's best known for its
role in attention working memory impulse
control being creative and also abstract
reasoning and thinking it's what really
makes us human because it's the youngest
part of our brain this is why children
and teenagers can act more impulsively
than adults their frontal lobes aren't
fully developed it isn't around until 20
years old or so before the frontal lobe
is fully developed one important area of
the frontal lobe is the primary motor
cortex this is in this area of the
frontal lobe it's pretty cool how this
was discovered a German psychologist in
the 1860s noticed that when he was
caring for injured soldiers he would
touch the surface of this area of the
brain and he found that a soldier's body
would actually twitch on the opposite
side so say he touched the right side
the left side of the soldier's body
would twitch from this and other
research we now know that different
parts of the cortex are responsible for
different functions all of the parts of
our body that we can move have a
dedicated region of the motor cortex
that is activated when we move our body
parts for example we have a region for
our fingers one for our wrists one for
our lips one for our legs and more you
get the picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
