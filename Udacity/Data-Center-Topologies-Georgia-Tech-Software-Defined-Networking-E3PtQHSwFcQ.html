prefix and that the paths that result
from the original bgp routing are shown
in green let's now suppose that a s100
seeks to become a man in the middle if
the original prefix being advertised was
p.s 100 could also advertise the prefix
p but we want to make sure that s 100
maintains a path back to a s 200 now
that path already exists it's right here
so what we want to do is make sure that
neither a s10 nor a s20 accept this
hijacked route the way that we can do
that is through a technique called a s
path poisoning so if a s100 advertises a
route that includes a s10 and a s 20 in
the a s path both of these a SS will
drop the announcement because they will
think they've already heard the
announcement and don't want to form a
loop on the other hand the other a esas
on the internet in other words every
other guess that's not on the path back
from 100 to 200 will switch and now all
the traffic from other a esas and route
to a s200 will traverse the attacker is
100 now a trace route might look awfully
funny taking this circuitous route but
actually the attacker can hide its
presence even if the sender is running a
trace route recall that a trace route
simply consists of ICMP time exceeded
messages that result when a particular
packet reaches a TTL of zero now
typically each router along a path will
decrement the TTL at each hop but if the
routers in the attackers network never
decrement the TTL then no time exceeded
messages would be generated by routers
in a s100 therefore the traceroute would
never show a s 100 on the path at all so
now that we've talked about the
importance of origin authentication and
attacks against it let's talk a little
bit about session authentication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
