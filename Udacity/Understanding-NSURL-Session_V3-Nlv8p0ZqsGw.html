to do is supply our nsurl session with a
request but first there are a few
important things that I want to point
out what we've been calling requests the
nsurl session refers to as tasks also
any tasks used by an antral session is a
subclass of nsurl session tasks let's
break that down there are three main
tasks that we can work with data tasks
download tasks and upload tasks a data
task or an nsurl session data tasks
returns data from the network directly
into memory as one or more NS data
objects the key word for remembering
this type of task is data data tasks are
good for short-lived requests and we'll
be using them exclusively in this course
a download task or nsurl session
download task returns data from the
network into a temporary file think of
these tasks like downloading a file from
the internet when the test completes you
have a file to work with and finally the
upload task or nsurl session upload task
these kinds of tasks are specialized for
uploading content like I said in this
course we're just going to focus on data
tasks to recap in the code we have the
image URL and we have the shared nsurl
session so now we're ready to make our
request or a task in this case to create
an nsurl session data task we need to
use the nsurl sessions method called
data task with URL we'll be using the
version of this method that takes a URL
and a closure called a completion
Handler and it returns an nsurl session
data task so I'll go ahead and capture
the return value which is the task and
then I'll specify our image URL and now
let's talk about the completion handler
the completion handler is just like any
other closure it's named completion
handler because it's executed after the
data task completes and we can't really
be sure when that will happen
the task might complete in a few
milliseconds or it might take a whole
minute but that's the real power of this
closure it's like a saying I don't
really know when this task is going to
complete but when it does run this block
of code now instead of using this
closure we could use nsurl sessions
family of delegates to handle running
code after the task completes but we
won't be doing that in this course if
you're interested I'll post links in the
instructor notes that
over the nsurl session delegates in more
detail now this completion handler takes
three parameters the types of those
parameters are NS data nsurlresponse--
and NS error now if you haven't seen
these types before don't worry we'll
slowly introduce them for their local
parameter names I'll call them data
response and error
for now let's ignore all of them and try
printing tasks finished when the task
completes and we'll build and run this
hmm well it doesn't appear to be working
because our print statement isn't
showing up let's talk about why this is
