useful for storing a single students
grades and you can get useful
information out of a single student
scores but when my friend Sorrell was
teaching math that wasn't enough
information for her she wanted
information about her teaching skills as
well as detailed summaries for the
students she wanted to know how well she
had taught fractions and how well she'd
taught equivalent fractions and for that
she would need to compare the data for
all of the students for one topic this
is starting to look like a 2d array with
this structure it would be possible to
calculate a total for a student and also
to calculate a total for a topic which
would allow her to compute sums for each
topic and then compare them to see which
topics she needed to spend more time on
once that was done she could write very
detailed customized teacher comments for
each student by looking at what they got
in each topic and choosing different
sentences based on that grade we're
going to implement this together I'm
going to make a class the grade book
class which will contain a 2d array of
all of the scores it'll also contain the
names of the students and the names of
the topics since you probably don't want
to enter these scores over and over
again I wrote a method that will read
the grade book scores from a file and
put them into the array for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
