actually any particular data structure
without any with some particular running
time it's actually kind of an abstract
data type it's a it's a data type that
supports three different operations we
have some kind of data and we can add a
new number to say the the set we can
also ask of all the numbers that are in
the set what's the smallest that we've
got and we can say if you don't mind
please remove this smallest from the
structure that we have doing whatever
updates are necessary so that these were
the rest of the operations can be
fulfilled now we can implement these
operations using ideas that we've
already got so things like we can insert
into a structure we can ask what's the
smallest element of the structure and we
can remove a structure from it let's use
this as an excuse to do a little review
here's two natural ways of implementing
the heap operations of inserting and
finding and removing the minimum from
the structure we can do it with an
ordered list or we can do with an
unordered list and there's trade-offs to
doing it this way so what I'd like you
to do is for how long does it take to do
an insert into an ordered list of length
n is that constant time log time or
linear time same thing for an unordered
list how long does it take to stick a
new item into the list and finally now
that you've done that we've say inserted
a bunch of elements in the list and
there's n in there now and we want to
ask the question how long does it take
to find and remove the minimum from an
ordered list is it constant log linear
and from an unordered list to find the
minimum value and remove it I'd like for
each of these rows you should check
exactly one of the boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
