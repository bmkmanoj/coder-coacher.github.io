perfect cipher is and to see why the
one-time pad satisfies this property so
the notion that we want a perfect cipher
to mean is that if an attacker
intercepts a message they receive the
cipher text that provides them with no
additional information at all about what
the plaintext was so we have a message
it's being encrypted with a key the
attacker is intercepting that cipher
text as its sent over this insecure
Channel
what we want to know is that an attacker
who sees just the cipher text learns
nothing about the message so if you
followed the definition of conditional
probability you should be able to decide
how to define that formally so we'll
make that a quiz so the question is
which of these is the property that we
want in order for a cipher to be perfect
that is to have this property that the
cipher text reveals no information about
the plain text so I'm going to introduce
some notation so our message is selected
from the set of all possible messages we
have some other message we'll call m
star also selected from M we don't know
if M is equal to M star both of these we
could think of being drawn from the set
of messages and we have some key drawn
from the set of possible keys so for
this quiz your goal is to understand how
we can formally define what a perfect
cipher it is and this is the scenario we
have an attacker who's heard a cypher
text we want to know that by hearing
just the cipher text the attacker has
learned nothing new about the message so
we've introduced some notation here we
have a set of possible messages the
uppercase M and we can select lowercase
messages M star
those are both message is selected from
M the attackers goal would be to tell is
the intercepted cipher text the same as
message M star that's the attackers
guess and we have encryption using some
key selected from the set of all
possible keys we don't know what the key
is
so here are the possible choices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
