about the public understanding of
genetics in particular do you think it's
a would you give them an a-plus would
you go I wouldn't give them an a-plus
but I give the a potential for having an
a-plus I think that the impact that
personal genomics and the rate at which
discoveries are happening I think that
this is going to force the hand of
Education in the public arena like I
think that people though they're going
to be interested in ever going to want
to learn more about the nitty-gritty of
genetics and I think that right now
there's just a lot of wonder and
curiosity and there are some people that
have really good information and there's
some people that have really bad
information just about like anything in
genetics you know as you know it can be
both simple some simple concepts to some
very complex one and the information
that one gets from their own personal
genetic background has both of those
things and it has the potential to be
confusing in the minefield of
misinformation but I hold a positive I
think there's a positive potential for
people learning and understanding but it
was always so fascinating to me is when
we meet new parents advertise parents
that have had a dwarf child and it
always comes to this they tell the story
of when they were given the diagnosis
and ninety percent of them have horrific
Lee bad stories to tell about how they
were told their child was going to be a
dwarf and I always want to go back and
hear the other side of that story you
know was it just a shock to them and and
they read negativity into it who was
that negativity negativity actually
delivered I just want to know in general
give any hopes or fears for the future
of genetic research well cousin of
the daughter of my uncle who was bracha
to found out she was bracha too and
she's in the process of seeing
physicians and one physician said to her
based on her age and my age and my
uncle's age that there's research going
on and they're probably within the next
few years they will find a moderator
mutation because why is it that there's
a spectrum of people who would get
breast cancer and so that we don't know
this yet but that's my hope as well the
research will continue and that they
will find out that some people why do
some people get breast cancer who have
brocket to and some people don't is it
environment or is it drinking too much
alcohol or not enough alcohol you know
what is it hopefully that second yeah
yeah so I think I definitely believe in
research and rewarding the companies
that so you his contribution so you
think the journey you hope the journey
will continue into research and funding
the research what else um I think of it
from the perspective of my grandchildren
that will come in about 10 or 15 years
and all of this testing will be put back
in the forefront in our family I guess
I'm there's a sense of relief knowing
that my boys as future dads will have
the information available to them
and they will have the freedom of choice
to do with that what they choose I hope
it continues and I hope it doesn't get
out depends whatever that means I think
for me my best hope would be that the
information progresses to a point where
that it helps people who are looking at
cures and treatments that it helps them
do their job and that it helps the
general public make informed personal
decisions my fear is kind of its light
hearted if you've seen the movie gattaca
that's basically the one of the fears of
it going out of hand where there is you
know people are forced to make choices
or where Sue's socioeconomic status can
determine like people can take more
advantage of this I mean it's kind of a
light-hearted yeah I fear but it's it's
legitimate fear that that kind of
embodies the fear of you know people
make having their ability to make their
choice taken away from them due to
socioeconomic status or outside
pressures I think because my hope would
be that it remains personal decisions my
hope is that you know it will help
individuals make medical decisions in a
more informed way both of themselves and
with clinicians and that for instance
pharmacologically like the
pharmacological principles once we know
the genetics of how we may respond to
certain drugs you know we'll be able to
fine-tune which drugs would help us move
which ones would more likely produce
side effects that's just an example I
think one thing that all of you touched
on but we never brought out into the
open so directly is the idea of genetic
determinism and really in your own way
you eacha brought to this course by
representing a trait or a particular
background how gray genetic determinism
really is and that human beings are not
just their genes right we're human
beings we're not just one trait were
many trades or many people together and
that I hope for the future that this
genetic information is we're able to use
this together to realize all the many
wonderful things that it means to be a
human and to make us unique individually
and as a species and that my only fear
is that we grow out of our adolescence
of you know misunderstanding each other
and and hope that we can understand how
we make decisions and consensus about
these ideas and I I think very truly
that it's in great part to people's
willingness like your own to participate
in projects like this and other
educational opportunities that that's
going to be possible so thank you for
four billion atoms thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
