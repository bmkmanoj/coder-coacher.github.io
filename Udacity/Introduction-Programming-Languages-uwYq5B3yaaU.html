and one of the things we're going to
cover is the surprising power you can
get from just writing down something
you've already computed and referring
back to it later that actually came up
once in my life a number of years ago I
had the privilege of working for
microsoft research on a project to try
to find and fix bugs in Windows now most
of you are probably watching from a
moon-based in the not-too-distant future
but in the present and in the past bugs
and windows were a big deal in fact it
would often crash and lead to the
dreaded blue screen of death and it
turned out that as much as we like to
pick on Microsoft most of the bugs
weren't in Microsoft code but in
third-party code written to drive
various bits of hardware like screens or
printers or memory sticks this software
was called device drivers and it might
work something like this memory stick
that I have right here Microsoft wrote a
tool to put this device driver software
through torture tests if you're a memory
stick i might add data to you and then
in the middle of reading it out pull you
out or turn off the power or in general
apply these normal operations very fast
or in a surprising order and this really
worked they found a lot of bugs so many
bugs that it's now a shipping product
the microsoft static driver verifier the
heart of this idea was a computer
science notion known as model checking
figuring out how a program behaves by
looking at its source code a key to that
was remembering things that had already
been computed if I already know how you
behave when I turn off the power in the
middle of an operation I don't have to
recompute it which might be very
expensive so this relatively simple
notion of writing down things so that we
don't have to recompute them it's
formally called memoization and it's one
of the gems we'll get to in this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
