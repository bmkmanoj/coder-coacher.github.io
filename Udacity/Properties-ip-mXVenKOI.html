associated with variables and constants
variables and constants that are
associated with a particular class are
known as properties we're gonna talk
about three types of properties stored
properties type properties and computed
properties let's start with stored
properties in Swift there's a strong
emphasis on immutability so you'll see a
lot more properties defined as constants
than in other languages let's talk about
how those constants are initialized
stored properties must be set when an
instance of a class is initialized here
we're setting the title director and
release here two strings being passed
into the init method in this case the
parameters have the same name as the
properties to distinguish the properties
from the parameters you can use self to
represent the object being initialized
initialization would look like this to
call the initializer instead of using
the name in it we use the name of the
class and then if we want to access the
properties that we just set we use dot
syntax so that's the name of the object
dot the name of the property and here in
the side bar we can see that the title
of thursday-night movie is Point Break
notice that I've used external parameter
names here external parameter names are
required for init methods there is
another option for setting in object
stored properties you can give them a
default value of course in this case
that wouldn't work out so well because
the director property is a constant so
it can't be changed but let's say we
were only interested in movies directed
by Rob Reiner we could set the default
value of director in the property
definition and then not bother setting
it in our named method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
