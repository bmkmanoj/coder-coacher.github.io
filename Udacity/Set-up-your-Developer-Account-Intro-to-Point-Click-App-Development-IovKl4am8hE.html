goodness why does it want this
information Sam in order to sign up for
a free developer account you have to
give them a little bit of information
but giving them your email so that they
can send you the signup information to
be able to log in well if I didn't have
a company okay just put none you could
put none but it's asking for some
geographical location just to send you
information about cool events that might
be coming up in your area what's the
deal in here
username is that different from my email
the username can be the same as your
email but if you already have a
developer edition account or any account
under that email it'll probably ask you
for a new username oh oh yeah whoops I
already knew okay um so what should I do
just like Andy I just like Andy at
udacity dot awesome yeah all right I
might have actually used this one
already - yep let's do Andy at Udacity
diet suite okay awesome no sweet so the
great thing about the developer edition
account is it's free it never expires
and it's your own little test
environment to build any sort of app you
might want to in it okay
says I should receive an email let's
check so click into that okay oh so this
one isn't actually the login email but
they send this out automatically when
you sign up it gives you some cool links
to getting started and you know learning
about the platform if you're new to it
but the other one is the actual login
link there it is okay login confirmation
I'm not gonna read this I'm going to
click this okay
I'm password right all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
