in the first column will consider
different programs and i'm just going to
label them p 1 for the first program p 2
for the second program and so on and so
on in the second column will then
consider different cases of what halt
can say with respect to that program
when considering what happens if the
program is run on itself so for example
we might say that for p1 halt might say
yes and for p2 it might say no when
given the program and the program as an
input now what does that mean so if halt
says yes and the first line here it
would mean that program one stops when
given program one as an input of course
similarly if halt says no it would mean
that p 2 goes into an infinite loop when
given p2 or itself as an input now we're
going to do a very quick quiz here
because what I would like you to think
about here for p1 and p2 what inverse
halt when run on that program actually
does so what does inverse halt do when
it's run on p1 and what does inverse
halt to do when it's run on p2 so does
inverse halt when run on p1 halt or go
into an infinite loop and does inverse
halt when run on p2 halt or go into an
infinite loop so so please check the one
that is correct for each one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
