finding the longest common substring the
longest common substring is going to be
the longest substring found in two or
more given strings let's go through an
example and I'll be pretty clear so here
I've written two words that I'm not
going to pronounce and if we look
closely the longest sequence of
characters that they have in common can
be found right here AP ACH there's no
other substring longer than five
characters found in both words and in
this problem we need to find the length
of the longest common substring so in
this case it would be five so a naive
solution to this problem which would be
really really slow is to calculate every
single possible substring in one word
and check if it's contained in the other
word so I would start with T then i
might do ta and then I might do ap PA AC
etc etc and then I go to three letters
and four letters and five letters and so
on and each time I would check if it's
in the other word if it is in the other
word I would check to see if it's the
longest substring of found so far and I
would update it so this is pretty slow
we're going to do something a little
different we're going to write three
functions the first function C suffix
finds the longest common suffix so given
two words like the ones we have here the
longest common suffix would be either
the empty string or none I mean there's
no suffix they have in common but if we
ignored the last few characters let's
say we had this the longest common
suffix is going to be a PA CH so we're
going to find a function that finds the
suffix which is going to be a step in
the direction of finding the more
general longest common substring the
second function we're going to write
creates a list of all the prefixes for a
given string so if we take in a word say
cat and calculate the prefixes of cat
will get a list exactly like this one
notice that if there are three
characters in the input string where the
list is going to be of length 3 and the
last function is going to find the
length of the longest common substring
the way we're going to do that is by
finding the largest common suffix of all
the prefixes so we're going to go
through each prefix calculate the
largest common suffix and then keep
track of the largest one we found and
the length of the largest common suffix
of all the prefixes quite a mouthful is
going to be the longest common substring
so let's get coding this so I've written
my function declaration for the common
suffix and one thing I that was noted in
a hint is that we're probably going to
want to cache the results of this
function in a chart to save time and be
more efficient so let's create that
chart and then we're going to check in
the first line of our function whether
or not we can reuse a value that we've
already calculated this is called
memoization so here I make sure that x
and y aren't int the empty string and if
they aren't I'm going to check to see if
the last value in each string is
matching if they do match my total
length of the common suffix is going to
increase by one because the last
characters match and then I'm going to
recursively call see suffix on
everything but the last character in the
string so a five cat and hat the first
recursive calls going to check T and cat
and the tea and hat we're going to see
that they match add 1 and then recurse
on cat and ha do the same thing recurse
on CH we're not going to find a match so
we're going to return the answer and of
course we have to remember to update our
chart if we did find an answer and
that's the common suffix let's move on
to the next one and as a spoiler each of
the remaining functions is exactly one
line long so here's the code for a
prefixes function as a reminder it takes
in a string and outputs a list of all
the prefixes for that string so let's
take a look at this output given an
input of cat we have C ca ca t if we are
going to relate this to our code cat
X and we want to see what substring
operations we can do on X to get these
strengths so here we're going to return
everything from index zero remember it's
01 to two one not including the one so
it's just going to be the first the 0
character we increment that by one we're
going to get the a increment by 1 again
and we get the tea and so what this list
comprehension does is it goes from zero
to the length of X so it's going to go
from zero the two and we're going to
take the substring from the beginning
all the way to i plus 1 so it's going to
go to one two three just like we had
here pretty simple so given our two
functions we're going to write L sub
string and as I said before this is
going to be the maximum length of the
common suffixes for all the prefixes
both x and y if you didn't follow along
the codes probably going to be clearer
so here I'm taking the maximum of the
list generated by this cut list
comprehension and what we're going to do
is find every combination of prefixes
for x and y together find the common
suffix of them and the maximum of that
list is going to be the longest common
substring of the entire word and that is
how you find the longest common
substring yay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
