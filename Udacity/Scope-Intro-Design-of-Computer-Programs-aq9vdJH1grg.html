about scope which is a concept that
we've been using in the course but
haven't actually talked about
specifically and so if you've been
getting confused by decorators which
decorate decorators or functions calling
functions which return functions and so
on this video's for you so when we talk
about a variable scope we're talking
about the region in a program in which
we can access that variable this is a
concept that can go from being very
simple to quite difficult so let's start
with something basic and build from
there here we've got some very simple
code x equals 2y equals 3 print the sum
and of course we get 5 in this example x
and y are what's called global variables
and they live in what will call the
global environment which i'm going to
represent with this box and in this
environment x is bound to the value to
and why is bound to the value 3 the
global environment is also where all of
our primitive operators are bound so for
example the plus sign is bound to some
object which carries out audition and we
won't go into too much detail what's
going on there so let's make things a
bit more interesting so here I've just
defined a function called atoms and it
returns X plus y and when I run it I get
11 so what's happened here is that our
function has created a new scope and
this scope is local to the function and
so what happened when we defined adams
was we made this binding between this
name and the function object now that's
fine but as soon as we called atoms by
setting print the result printed nums we
created a new environment and i'm going
to call this environment adams and in
this environment we made an assignment
or to assign from X 25 and from y 26
when we call adams python prefers to
choose variables within its local scope
if it can't do that it then moves up
following this pointer to what's called
its enclosing environment since this
Adams environment lives inside of this
global environment and looks there if
after following all these paths up into
the global environment it still doesn't
find the variable it's looking for
that's when we get an error specifically
a name error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
