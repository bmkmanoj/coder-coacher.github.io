we're going to do list comprehensions so
you've seen them before if we saw in
unit one we said that we could get the
list of suits by saying s for R and s in
cards and so the format here is we have
the individual term of the list
comprehension and here we have a for
Clause and in general we're going to
have one for clause at least and then
optionally we could have more here
either for or if clauses and that's what
a list comprehension looks like in
general now what is the list
comprehension mean well this expression
is similar to saying we're going to
write out a loop where we say the result
starts as the empty list then we take
the four part and then we take the term
and append that into the result and then
when we're all done result will hold the
value of this expression now I'm going
to show you a more complex list
comprehension say we wanted the list of
suits for all our face cards then we
could say s for our s in cards if the
rank of the cards is say in Jack queen
king I don't know why you'd want that
but there's a possibility so I've got
the term I'm building up I've got one
for loop controlling it and now I've got
an if statement and that's as if we'd
written this code if we had inserted
inside the for loop an if statement and
then only done the appending of the term
S if the if statement is true and in
general we can have any number of four
statements if statements more four
statements more if statements we can
keep on adding those four clauses and if
clauses and intermingling them in any
order we want as long as the four clause
comes first and we can have that one big
list comprehension and that corresponds
to putting in more fours and ifs here in
this loop and the whole thing is read
left to right except for the term
so the way to read a list comprehension
is to say I'm going to ignore the first
part for now and then
I think of it as saying it's a bunch of
nested statements for statements if
statements for statements they all get
nested deep in deeper and deeper then
when I get to the end the very last
clause now I'm appending together the
term so now read the term and that's why
it's okay that term here looks like it's
referencing a variable s that hasn't
been defined yet that's okay because s
has been defined here and it looks like
it's used before it's defined but that's
not the case because when it's actually
used is right down here at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
