is called naivebayes
what we've done is he said there's
unknown concepts these are our target
labels
let's call them label a and label B and
you don't get to see them they're hidden
as is always the case in supervised
learning and what you get to see instead
are things these things do like words
they use if they use them with exactly
the same probability you could never
figure out who it is but they using with
different probabilities and they might
use one of them or a hundred or a
thousand but every word that you see at
this one over here gives you evidence as
to whether it was person a or person B
and what do you do is you just multiply
all the evidences for every word you see
it's a big product you do this for
person a and for person B and you
multiply in the prior and when this
product comes out it gives you the ratio
of whether you believe it's person a or
person B that is called naive Bayes it
lets you identify from a text source
whether this label is more likely or the
slave is more likely and you can do this
with people with new sources you can ask
the question was a text written by
Shakespeare or was somebody else it's a
very powerful tool that's widely used
all across machine learning and the
reason why it's called naive is because
it ignores one thing and you tell me
which one is all the individual words in
the message the order of the words
inside a message or the length of the
message which one is being plainly
ignored here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
