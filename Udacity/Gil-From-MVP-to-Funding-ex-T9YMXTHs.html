funded is really depending on many
factors perhaps the main one being the
domain yet so there's some domains like
security for example that may be an MVP
plus you know an early pilot would be
enough to get your seed funding there's
some domains perhaps a mobile
application that more often than not
requires more than just the basic MVP
but actually some proof in the market
that this can be something interesting
clearly there's no rules and no right or
wrong but it really does depend on the
domain you at but once you're ready it's
it's about having everything you need
you know to fundraise you need to show
that you know you have some plan of what
you want to do with the market when you
find what you want to do with the money
when you find ways you have the team and
the MVP is a good indicator that you
know what maybe it's interesting what
you've built and this MVP it shows not
only your ability as a team to execute
but the market is receptive to what you
what you have built</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
