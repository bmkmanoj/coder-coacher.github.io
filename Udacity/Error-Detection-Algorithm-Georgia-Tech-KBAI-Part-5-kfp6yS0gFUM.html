elements in an agent classification
knowledge may be potentially responsible
for this failure let us look at the
problem of identifying the false success
elements as you said earlier potentially
the agent may receive a set of positive
experiences and a set of negative
experiences not just one positive or one
negative first take the intersection of
all the features that are responsible
for all the files successes a false
success again is something that we
identified a success but was not a
success like the pale we identified it
as a cup it was not a cup first take the
intersection of all the features present
for all the false successes Paul success
is an object that the agent identified
as a success but in fact was false like
the pail the agent identified that it
was a cup but it wasn't then get the
union of the features present for all
the true successes a true success is
something that the agent classified as
the success and indeed was a success now
remove all the assertions at the union
of the true successors from the
intersection default successes to
identify those elements that are present
in default successes only so put that
differently start off by gathering
together anything that's ever present in
a fault success then gathered together
everything that's true for every single
true success remove the things that are
true for every true success from the
things that are ever true for any fault
success in that way we get a list of
only the things that are true for some
thought successes similar to fight and
defend suspicious true success
relationships except that here the
operations are in Reverse so similarly
here we gather together everything
that's ever true about any true success
and then gather together things that are
true for every single fault success so
every single false example has these
things in common then we remove the
things that every single false example
has in common from the things that are
true for any true example as you can see
we are taking unions and intersections
of features characterizing different
examples the number of examples both
positive and negative needed for this
algorithm to work well depends upon the
complex with you d concept and generally
more features you have the description
of the objects more will be the number
of the examples will need to identify
the features that will respond
support for a failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
