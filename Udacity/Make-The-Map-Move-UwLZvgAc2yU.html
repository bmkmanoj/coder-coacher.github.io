camera method that you saw in the
previous video note that it has three
buttons just like in a previous
application that you build and each of
these buttons animates map movement to a
different location so for example I'm
now looking at a map of the United
States but if I tap on Seattle you see
the camera is going to animate as i zoom
into seattle taking a few seconds to do
so it's a really cool effect someone
salmon on seattle there you can see some
of seattle including you can even see
here an indoor map of the Pacific
Science Center in Seattle for example
then can touch on Tokyo and you'll see
I'll fly up and out into orbit and then
back down over the Pacific until I land
on Tokyo like so and again you can see
I'm now in downtown Tokyo and if I so
desire I can also go to Dublin now here
there's a case of I haven't kept
pre-cached some of these tiles so you're
just seeing blank as its flying over and
it'll soon land on Dublin sorry if i
zoom out of Dublin you can see those
tiles are getting cached so none of
these tiles were pre cached for testing
the video and that's why we couldn't see
when we flew from Tokyo to Dublin but if
I just zoom out and effectively cache
the tiles I'm not doing anything myself
to catch them this is just how the
application is running and so will the
map fragment itself or cache the tiles
for you so here you can see Japan if I
go back somewhere over Ireland and now I
tap on Tokyo you'll see that the orbit
will change I'll drop down on to Tokyo
and now if I try to go to Dublin you'll
see I fly out of Japan
up over the surface of the earth over
Asia over China back over Western Europe
before dropping down in on to Dublin so
you now have everything you need to
build this application yourself you have
all the tools why don't you give it a
shot if you have any trouble the source
