implementing a fast parallel algorithm
for seamless image cloning seamless
image cloning is modern algorithm for
pasting one image into another in a very
subtle way and here's an example of
seamless image cloning so for example
you have a bear a swimming pool and with
seamless image cloning you now have a
polar bear in a swimming pool
our algorithm for seamless image
cleaning uses a technique called double
buffering to iteratively compute a
solution you main idea behind double
buffering in the context of this
homework as dad in store an approximate
solution to a problem in one buffer then
when you use that approximate solution
to compute a better solution which will
in store in another buffer then when go
in the other direction computing an even
better solution and store that solution
in the first buffer after going back and
forth many times we will arrive at a
ideal solution to our problem this die
of computation arises in many parallel
algorithms which is why we think they
will make a really interesting homework
assignment before we implement seamless
image cloning that's take a closer look
at our inputs we are given as inputs a
source image a target image and the mask
we want to copy the mask value from the
source image into the target image in a
subtle way to do this when Harco the
values on the inside border of the mask
region should be the same as the target
image then what we do is to solve for
the unknown pixel values in the strict
interior of the mask region so how do
you find these unknown pixel values in
the strict interior portion of the mask
image we can do that as follows first
step we will make a guess for the
unknown pixel values and that's Co our
initial guess eyes eyes zero doesn't
have to be a very good guess so one can
set a zero to be all zeros in the strict
incurable
portion of our mask image but note that
zero will be a very bad guess because it
would not be very subtle and it also
will not conform to the source image
very well now suppose we are given a
guest solution I K to our problem we can
compute a better guess I Cape lusts one
as follows for some pixel small I K
plus-1 in big I K plus 1 in the strict
interior region of the mask we can
compute the value of a small I of K plus
1 as a plus B plus C divided by D and
let's go through each of a and B and C
and D one at a time a is the sum of I
case neighbors when don't include I gain
the sum and we only include I case
neighbors if they are in the strict
interior portion of the masked region B
is the sum of T's neighbors where T is
the corresponding pixel value in the
target image and the target image in our
case is the swimming pool and we only
include T's neighbors if they are in the
inside border of the mask region and C
is the sum of the difference between s
and s s neighbors where s in this case
is the corresponding pixel value in the
source image and the source image in our
case is the polar bear and finally D is
the number of eye case neighbors and I
case neighbors can be less than 4 if i
ka is on the border of the image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
