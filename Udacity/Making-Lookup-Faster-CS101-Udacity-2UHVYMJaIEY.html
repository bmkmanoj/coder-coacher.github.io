faster well let's think about why it was
so slow right the reasonable it was so
slow is that we were doing this for loop
we're going through all the elements in
order and we're checking if they match
the keyword and we had to do this going
through the entire index for an entry
for a keyword that's not in the index to
determine that it's not there we had to
go through the whole index this is not
the way we use indexes in real life
right if you're looking for a word in
the index of a book you don't have to
look through every single entry to see
if that word exists you can jump around
and the reason you can jump around is
because the entries in index are sorted
they're sorted in alphabetical order so
you know where that entry would belong
you just need to find the right place
and see if it's there so we could do
that with our index instead of having
our index kept in arbitrary order if we
kept our index in a sorted order then we
could find the place where that entry
belongs and look forward sorting is a
very interesting problem it's something
we're not actually going to talk about
more in this class we're going to do a
different way of doing that what we're
going to do is find a way to find where
the entry should be that doesn't require
actually keeping all the entries sorted
what we want is something that will
allow us given a keyword we're going to
have some function that tells us where
it belongs we're going to call that a
hash function that tells us where in the
entry to look and so instead of having
to look through the whole index the hash
function will tell us where that entry
belongs so what we need for this is some
function that's going to take a keyword
map it to a number and that number is
the position in index where that entry
belongs we could do this lots of
different ways one simple thing would be
to think well we know the alphabet this
is more like the way an index for a book
would work and we're going to have for
each entry in the next we'll have based
on the first letter will put all the
entries that start with that first
letter in the same place so if we're
looking for a key word that starts with
you that but for hash would tell us to
look in the place where all the words
that start with you are and then we'd
only have to look through the words that
start with you so this would allow us to
do a lookup much more
quickly then looking through the whole
index this isn't quite the best way to
do things right if we made our places
based on the letter well then we have a
problem if we have two words with the
same first letter certainly expect to
have more than one word that starts with
the same letter so instead of having
just an element here for each position
we're going to have a list of elements
that would be all the words that start
with you so when we look up the word
Udacity we would look in the entry for
you and if the word that's there doesn't
match then we know you dasa t isn't in
dynamics there are lots of problems with
this the first problem is well there
might be more than one word that starts
with you so we can't just have one entry
here what we need to have is a list of
entries we often call this a bucket so
we need a bucket of all the entries that
start with you that would be in this
position so instead of having just one
entry like the old structure of our
index now we're going to have a list of
entries and each element of the index
will now be a bucket which is a list of
entries that are in the right position
this is going to be our bucket of our
all the entries that start with you and
that would have all the different
entries that start with the letter U in
that bucket so this is getting better
now for each look up instead of having a
look through all of the words in index
we just need to find the position that
starts with the right letter that's got
a bucket of all the words that start
with that letter and then we just need
to look through that bucket this works
okay but this doesn't really scale very
well at best if we have no 10 million
words well now instead of having 10
million entries to go through we need to
go through 10 million / say 26 if we
have 26 letters it's not making things
much faster making things maybe at best
26 times letter that assumes that all of
the buckets are the same size certainly
if we make the buckets based on the
first letter that's not going to be the
same size if the words are typical
English words we're going to have many
more words that start with s and T say
then let's start with you so we want to
fix those two problems we want to be
able to have more buckets so we're not
going to just use the first letter we're
going to use some function on the whole
word that tells us where it belongs and
we're going to try to make that function
distribute the words fairly
well so the structure that I've
described is what's called a hash table
this is a very useful data structure
it's so useful that it's built into
Python there's a Python type called a
dictionary which provides this
functionality at the end of today's unit
I'll explain how the Python dictionary
works and how to use it and we'll modify
the search engine code to use dictionary
instead of the lookup table that we
built but before we do that we're going
to implement it ourselves we're going to
make sure that we understand how the
hash table works by writing all the code
to do it ourselves and then we'll switch
to using the built-in Python type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
