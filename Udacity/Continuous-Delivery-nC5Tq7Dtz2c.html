the software builds and runs
successfully and then you do the testing
there are still steps between this point
and the software release automating the
release pipeline down to the software
release is called continuous delivery
but since some of QA is a manual process
you cannot run the next step completely
automatically you need a manual trigger
in the pipeline to deploy to the next
stage which is usually a staging server
for example testing against a real
database you can run more automated in
manual tests on staging and one
successful you can manually trigger the
deployment it's important to note that a
manual trigger does not equal a manual
build or deployment build and deployment
is automatic it's just the trigger that
starts the process is manual
there are integrations with
communication software that allows these
manual triggers to be launched in a more
publicly visible and convenient way than
logging into a particular software
program for example there are chat BOTS
for popular team communication platforms
like slack and HipChat
that can be integrated with Jenkins
circle C I and other CI solutions these
chat BOTS can send build test
information to a public chat room and
react to commands written into the chat
that makes it easy and fast to
coordinate within the team if the CI
build and test passes using chat you can
pull all involved developers with
something like my change is good to go
and then issue that command into the
chat bot this makes for a fast and
transparent release process we will not
be setting up these chat services but C
instructor notes for more information if
you have a service that handles
thousands of user transactions every
second over dozens or hundreds of
servers you're not going to sit there
and watch the log files to see if it's
working right you as a human being
literally cannot read thousands of
messages per second in hundreds of log
files you can't react the difference
between an acceptable and an
unacceptable level of errors without
monitoring systems to be your eyes and
ears you literally do not have the
ability to notice or care about
something happening that fast there are
a few different ways that we can gather
data about our services not all of them
apply to all services though one is
external probing or sending test queries
outside system will send queries into
our system and see if it performs as
expected and record the results another
is application level metrics that are
exported by monitoring interfaces of our
serving processes this might include
things like the number of queries
they're handling per second or what the
latency is those can be pushed into a
monitoring system or pulled into it from
the server another thing to monitor our
stats that are exported by our runtime
environment for instance the memory
profile in a Java JVM and then there's
also information about the computers
that were actually running on such as
the load average or the number of disk
errors you can actually very typically
discover that a disk is about to fail by
monitoring the number of errors it's
having other sources of monitoring data
can include logs analysis query
profiling such as Google App engines app
stats and external analytic services
there are also a number of different
data products that a monitoring system
can provide the one everybody knows
about is alerting getting a page saying
the system is too slow but your
monitoring system can also provide
charts and graphs for performance
analysis say things like this releases
10% faster than last one and also for
capacity prediction for instance if it
takes 10 instances to support a thousand
transactions per second then if we scale
to 2,000 transactions per second we
should expect to need 10 more instances
also for growth measurement you can plot
a graph out of your monitoring system
and see that your service is doubled in
traffic every three months you can
combine that with the capacity
prediction to get capacity needs
forecasting tell you how many computers
you're going to need next quarter and
last but not least your monitoring
system can also provide great metrics
for debugging problems for instance
suppose you're trying to diagnose why
your servers are crashing if you notice
from your monitoring that each instance
is using more and more memory
proportional to the number of user
queries that might indicate to look for
a memory leak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
