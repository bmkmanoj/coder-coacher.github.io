elements of a good experimental study
let's put it all together into an
experiment so what we're going to do is
begin our experiment the way all
psychology experiments do by getting the
informed consent from our participants
informed consent means that the
participant is aware of all the
requirements of the study and agrees to
participate once they've given us
consent we decide we're going to
randomly put our participants into
groups by flipping a coin to ensure that
it's randomly assigned because this is a
single blind study we know who is going
to be in the control group and we know
who's going to be in the experimental
group the experimental group again is
those who get caffeine and the control
group they don't get caffeine everything
other than the independent variable has
to be the same in both groups so our
next step is to measure their reaction
time to do this we use a reaction time
test online when the screen changes from
white to black the participant has to
click we took the average of 5 trials
from each participant you can try this
test on your own by clicking the link
