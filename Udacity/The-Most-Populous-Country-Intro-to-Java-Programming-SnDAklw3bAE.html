country as well as the country's
population will initialize largest
country name with the first country that
we look at sort of the way we initialize
the largest population with just the
population that we looked at now when we
find something which has a population
larger than the largest population will
need to update the largest country name
as well as the largest population now
when our program gets to the end where
we print things out it'll still have
access to the largest and the largest
country name but it's only printing out
the population so I'll add a line print
the country with the large population is
and the variable where we saved the
largest country's name when it asks for
a file I'll find the population file and
I get that the country with the largest
population is Afghanistan at 3.04 19 e7
that seems pretty funny to me I don't
think of Afghanistan is a very big
country let's look at these numbers
Afghanistan has eight digits but
Bangladesh has nine clearly there's
something wrong with the program it
looks like it set the largest population
and the largest population name the
first time but then after that probably
didn't update it so there must be
something wrong with my loop oh it's
looking for a double first but the
format of the file has the name of the
country first and then something that
could be read as a double so this should
actually just be has next not has next
double let's try this again okay now I'm
getting that the country with the
largest population is China what this is
its population that seems much more
reasonable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
