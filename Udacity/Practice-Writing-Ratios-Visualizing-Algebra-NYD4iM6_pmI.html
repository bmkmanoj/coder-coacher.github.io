quarters is two to three so if i reverse
that ratio the number of quarters to the
neuro dimes must be three to two I can
write that with words with a colon or as
a fraction the second one was really
tricky I don't know the total number of
Dimes and I don't know the total number
of coins so what can I do well let's try
some cases if I started out with two
dimes I'd have to have three quarters
which would be five coins in total but I
didn't necessarily have to start with
two dimes what if I started with four
dimes I doubled the number of Dimes that
I started with so I also need to double
my number of quarters so four dimes
would have six quarters which would be
ten coins in total notice that two
divides into four and ten choose the
common factor so i can simplify this
fraction and even if i had six times i
would have to have nine quarters or 15
coins in total and this fraction still
reduces to two fists I've removed a
three as the common factor that's pretty
incredible I didn't even know the total
number of coins or the total number of
Dimes but I knew their ratio it was 225
if you didn't get the second part of the
problem right that's okay I just wanted
to get you thinking about ratios</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
