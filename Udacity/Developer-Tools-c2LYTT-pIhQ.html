you something that every web developer
needs to know developer tools this may
seem a bit overwhelming at first but I
promise you'll learn to love them I'm
going to open up Google Chrome and visit
one of my favorite websites espn.com now
I could demonstrate this using another
web browser that has developer tools but
for this demonstration I'm going to use
Google Chrome if I right click this page
and select the inspect option in the
drop down
it opens Google's developer tools
remember how I said it would seem
overwhelming I wasn't kidding there's a
ton of stuff here to keep this simple
I'm only going to focus on the elements
tab but know that the other tabs can
give you a much closer look into how a
website is built how it performs and
what's going on behind the scenes let's
try something out if you notice under
this elements tab we have some HTML this
is actually the HTML for the page we're
currently viewing this is more obvious
when I start hovering over elements in
HTML because Google Chrome highlights
the corresponding elements on the page
that's pretty sweet and if I click on
one of these elements then in the bottom
right-hand corner I can see what styles
are being applied to it
that's even better hmm it looks like the
element I've selected got a lot going on
let's try unchecking one of these
properties to see what happens
whoa did you see that the background
color of the navigation just disappeared
that's because I changed the CSS being
applied to this element by unchecking
the box
I removed the background color this div
normally uses let's try another one I'll
select one of these articles and let's
try changing the background color oh wow
now these articles look like they're
floating on the page each article just
runs up against the next one and it's
not easy anymore to tell where one
starts and where the next one begins now
don't worry these changes aren't
permanent and they're only visible to me
on this computer if i refresh the page
everything returns back to normal as you
can tell I could spend all day playing
around with the styling on this page but
hopefully what is more obvious to you is
that you see how beneficial developer
tools can be to a web developer they
literally tell us exactly how the page
is built you can see both the
tml and the CSS that is creating the
page that you see in the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
