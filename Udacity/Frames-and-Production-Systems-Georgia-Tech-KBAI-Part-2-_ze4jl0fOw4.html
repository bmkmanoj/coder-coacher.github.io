frames earlier when we were talking
about production systems you may recall
we had a diagram like this where we had
procedural semantic and episodic
knowledge the working memory contain a
structure like this you can see this is
really a frame here are these slots here
are the values for the slots we can
think of these frames as capturing
conceptual knowledge that is stood in
the semantic memory so let's take an
example suppose an input is a show Gator
frog remember the word aight there and
that verb 8 gets between the working
memory and the entire frame for it gets
pulled out once this frame is pulled out
a somatic memory it immediately
generates expectations so we now know
that 8 is likely to have a subject and
object and location perhaps time
utensils and so on so we can ask our
first equation but what will go under
subject here what will go under object
here and the scent is Ashok ate a frog
this frame tells us what to look for as
a result of which the processing is not
just bottom-up coming from natural
language or the world in general and
going into mind also mine provides
knowledge structures like frames rich
structured knowledge representations
which generate expectations and make the
processing partially top down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
