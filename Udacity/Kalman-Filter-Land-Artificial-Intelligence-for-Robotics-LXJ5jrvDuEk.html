about high-dimensional gaussians these
are often called multivariate gaussians
the mean is now a vector with one
element for each of the dimensions the
variant square is replaced by what's
called a covariance and it's a matrix
with D rows and D columns if the
dimensionality of the estimate is D and
the formula is something you have to get
used to
I'm writing it out for you but you never
get to see this again tell you the truth
even I have to look up the formula for
this class so I don't have it in my head
and please don't get confused let me
explain it to you more intuitively he
has a two dimensional space a two
dimensional Gaussian is defined over
that space and it's possible to draw the
contour lines of the Gaussian it might
look like this the mean of this Gaussian
is this x0 y0 pier and the covariance
now defines the spread of the Gaussian
as indicated by these contour lines a
Gaussian with small amount of
uncertainty might look like this it
might be possible to have a fairly small
uncertainty in one dimension by the
usual certainty in the other he didn't
certainty in the X dimension is small in
the Y dimension is large and when the
Gaussian is tilted it's showed over here
then the uncertainty of x and Y is
correlated which means if I get
information about X that actually sits
over here that would make me believe
that Y probably sits somewhere over here
that's called correlation I can explain
to you the entire effect of estimating
velocity and using it in filtering using
Gaussian selectees and it becomes really
simple the problem I'm going to choose
is a one dimensional motion example
let's assume a T equals 1 we see your
object over here at equals 2 right over
here at T equals 3 over here
then you would assume that a Teague was
for the objects it's over here and the
reason why you would assume this is even
though we just seen these different
discrete locations you can infer from it
there's actually velocity that drives
the object to the right side to the
point over here now how does a common
filter addresses this is the true beauty
of the common filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
