imagine for now that halts of TSI f is
true that T sif terminates this means
that after a finite number of steps TSI
f must return a value well let's go
through and see what that value is we go
in here and if halts TSI F well actually
we were just assuming that was true so
we'll definitely take this then branch
oh we loop forever so we assumed that T
sif halted but now we seem to be looping
forever that is a contradiction and it
makes me super unhappy by the way
acutely sometimes people in mathematics
rarely but sometimes draw crossed swords
to show a contradiction that's of course
near and dear to my heart so we'll use
that so when we thought the procedure
halted its source code made it loop
forever well so if it's not one it must
be the other let's try the other
approach let's say that we think that
TSI f does not halt so it should loop
forever so let's run it and see it
looping forever we get in here is halts
TSI f true I know we just assumed it was
false okay so we go down to the else
branch and we immediately return that's
kind of annoying because we were
assuming that it doesn't halt that it
loops forever neither of those options
are possible this is also tricky there's
no possible value for halts that works
out no matter what you do it ends up
being wrong and this is why we could
never have a procedure like halts that
worked in the real world even if you
thought it worked on some cases there's
one evil case at least where it doesn't
TSI f this sentence is false it's a
paradox and the essence of a paradox
like this is self reference this
sentence talks about itself this
sentence asserts its own falsehood
similarly the source code for T sif
talks about whether or not TSI f halts
this is the computer programming
equivalent of a natural language paradox
like this sentence is false if I ask you
is this sentence true well that can't be
right because then it would truthfully
be asserting that it's false so that's a
contradiction if I ask you is this
sentence false well then we'd invert it
and have it be asserting that it was
true Oh another contradiction none of
these work it's the same problem in
natural language or in computer science
you may have heard a similar version of
this called the barber paradox which is
typically phrased as something like the
barber cuts the hair of each person in
this village who does not cut its own
hair the question is does the barber do
a self haircut or not it's a lot like
this sentence is false but one level
removed you may also have heard empanada
spera docks all Cretans are liars I'm a
cretin just like this sentence is false
but one step removed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
