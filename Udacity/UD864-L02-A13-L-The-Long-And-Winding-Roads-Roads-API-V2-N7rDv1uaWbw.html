anything
what's that RJ jittery GPS tracks yeah I
hate jittery what's jittery GPS tracks
well you know is when a GPS tracker has
low accuracy and things I'm driving on
the side of the road it drives me crazy
I mean why can't it just know that I'm
driving on a particular Road why is it
always gotta be so jittery
well RJ I know the perfect solution to
your problem have you heard of the
Google Maps roads API nobody tell me
more well the roads API takes in those
questionably accurate GPS points such as
these jittery points around Munich
Germany on the bloomin Strasse and
frauen Strasse and snapped them to the
road that you are most likely on you
simply pass in up to a hundred of these
jittery GPS coordinates and poof the
roads API returns a similar set of data
with the points snap to the most likely
road the vehicle was traveling along
optionally you can request that the
points be interpolated resulting in a
path that smoothly follows the geometry
of the road are you serious that's
amazing I know think of all the fleet
tracking and ride-sharing applications
that could benefit from something like
this and guess what what there's more
wood with the roads API you can also get
back posted speed limit data for
particular Road segments that is super
useful now you can identify vehicles
that might be speeding exactly remember
the roads API is only available as a web
service also it's important to note that
this data is only available to premium
plan customers so the API key that you
generated and your newly created
developers project won't work for these
types of requests let's test out a few
speed limit data requests this is a snap
to roads request so we'll input the
required parameters which is our path a
set of eight jittery GPS points and
we'll set interpolate to true we're also
including our API key of course what we
get back is a set of nicely fitted
points which if I plot them will appear
right along a road
as you can see we get back way more than
eight points because we've interpolated
to get many more points this on the
other hand is a speed limits request we
still pass in a path which consists of
GPS points and our API key what we get
back is speed limit data about points
along that route keep in mind that these
are specifically web services there
isn't an equivalent service within our
JavaScript API however if you're running
a delivery service or taxi-hailing app
this can be really useful in getting you
accurate location data Wow
that was some really cool stuff thanks
for solving my jittery GPS problem now
let's go get some ice cream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
