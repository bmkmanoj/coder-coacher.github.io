syntax in HTML is called a tag kind of
like a price tag you might attach to a
shirt or another item you're buying this
modifies nearby text tells you how to
interpret it whether you can wash it or
not in a machine how much it costs
whether or not it should be bolded or
underlined that sort of thing another
super common kind of tag is the anchor
tag which is used to add hyperlinks to
web pages in some sense this is the
defining characteristic of what it means
to be a web page here are written
fragment of HTML that includes such an
anchor tag it begins here but unlike the
relatively simple bold and underlined
tags it has an argument and this means
pretty much the same thing it did when
we were talking about functions in
Python or math here the argument to my
sine function is pi hear the argument or
modifier for my anchor tag is h r EF
equals this stands for hypertext
reference the target of this link here
I've given a string that is a URL a web
address hypertext Transfer Protocol
google com this text in the middle is
often rendered in blue with an underline
although it doesn't have to be and then
over here we're ending the anchor tag
let's see how this plays out so here
I've left the old Eric Blair is really
George Orwell text but I've added a new
sentence click here for a link tool page
and right after the anchor starts the
text is rendered in a slightly different
color and if we were to click on it you
can potentially see down in the lower
left that it goes to google com just to
break this down if this is a fragment of
HTML then the words click here and now
we'll all be drawn on the screen this
syntax marks the beginning of the anchor
tag this syntax left angle bracket slash
a right angle bracket marks the end of
the anchor tag and this part in here is
the argument of the tag contains extra
information for things that are more
complicated than a simple bold or
underline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
