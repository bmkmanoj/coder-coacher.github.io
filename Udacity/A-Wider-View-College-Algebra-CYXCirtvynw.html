some basic functions like this one y
equals x squared whose graph is this
lovely purple parabola you also learned
about some other polynomial functions
for example we have y equals x cubed
also which produce this really different
and really interesting graph so clearly
the large-scale behavior of different
functions is really different depending
on what their equation looks like and it
also changes from region to region of
the domain I wonder what happened if we
increase the degree of a polynomial
function even more like let's say we
have y equals x to the fourth well
that's totally different again that's
really interesting it will just get rid
of these two that we already know a lot
about and just focus on this one let's
say something else y equals x to the
fourth plus X well that's cool that's
totally different than anything we've
ever seen before together and of course
we can add and change terms so having me
this x squared that changes the behavior
again what do I make this x cubed
instead everything makes these little
minut adjustments in the middle of the
graph right here that's pretty cool now
I wonder I just changed one exponent
what if i change this first one the
exponent of the leading term Wow now
this graph is completely different once
again changing the degree of the
polynomial seems to really change the
overall behavior what if I make this
sign negative well that's really
interesting oh my gosh clearly changing
different terms and polynomials
especially the leading term the term at
the highest power has major effects on
the graph I think this merits some more
exploration in this lesson we're going
to investigate the overall appearance of
different polynomial functions in terms
of how they look when we're zoomed way
way out and one resumed in on the middle
of the graph in particular we're going
to see where these functions intersect
the x-axis and how this relates to
factors and roots of polynomials I'm
really excited about the content of this
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
