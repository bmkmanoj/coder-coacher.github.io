high-performance processor which of
course is going to be power efficient
what are we optimizing for one choice is
minimizing latency latency is the amount
of time to complete a task we always
relate and see in units of time like
seconds the other choice is throughput
throughput is task completed per unit
time and we measure throughput in units
as stuff per time like jobs completed
per hour unfortunately these two goals
are not necessarily aligned in America
if you have a driver's license or a car
you've had the unfortunate opportunity
to visit a government office called the
Department of Motor Vehicles if you're
not from America you've probably visited
something like it so in your head when I
say DMV substitute your favorite
government office when you visit the DMV
it's a very frustrating experience you
wait in lines a lot this is not
necessarily the fault of the DMV though
the reason this happens is because your
goals are not aligned with the DMV's
goals your goal is to optimize for
latency you want to spend as little time
in the DMV as possible instead however
the DMV optimizes for throughput
specifically the number of customers
they serve per day consequently these
two people sitting behind the desk right
here that work for the DMV want long
lines long lines mean their hard-working
employees are always busy because
there's never a time they don't have a
customer waiting traditional cpus
optimized for latency they try to
minimize the time elapsed of one
particular task
GPUs instead choose to optimize for
throughput this is a fundamentally
different approach and one that is
aligned with technical trends in the
computer industry I'll refer you to a
2004 article by David Patterson called
latency lags bandwidth there are many
many applications were optimizing for
throughput is the right approach in
computer graphics for instance we care
more about pixels per second than the
latency of any particular pixel we're
willing to make the processing time of
one pixel take twice as long if it means
we get more pixel throughput this class
is home work focuses on image processing
applications here we also care more
about throughput which is more about
pixels produced per second than the time
for one individual pixel image
processing applications are a perfect
match for the GPU which is why we're so
excited about using them as a driving
example in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
