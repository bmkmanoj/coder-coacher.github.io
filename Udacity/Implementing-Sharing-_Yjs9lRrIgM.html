friends and you can add those friends to
the shared list here just by clicking
this button and you can also remove them
pretty cool so it looks like we're
effectively keeping track of who is
shared on what lists so now it's time to
actually change around the user list to
add shopping lists when they're shared
with the user this is a fairly
complicated tasks so here's some
thoughts that i had about how to break
it down my recommendation is that the
first thing you should do is to add and
remove a list to a user's list so when
you press the plus button and becomes
green you should actually take that list
and add it to the user list of the
friend that you're sharing with
conversely if you press that green check
to unshare it it should remove the list
from your friends user lists also a
quick reminder whenever you're changing
around who shared on the list it should
update the timestamp last changed for
all users okay so once you've got that
working you can change update map for
all with value to update the list for
all shared users right now it's doing it
pretty effectively for the owner but you
should have this method also update for
anybody that's on the shared with list
for update map for all with value to
actually be able to do this you might
need to change the signature to include
passing in a shared with list and since
you're probably going to be changing
around that method signature you're also
going to want to update all the places
that you call update map for all with
valium so that you can pass in that
shared with list you might find that
you're calling this method from adapters
dialogues and that gets a little bit
more tricky let me give you some tips
for adapters you could set a list of
sharp users much like you set a shopping
list in an adapter let me show you in
the code an inactive list item adapter I
have a shopping list member variable and
that shopping list member variable is
actually set here with this set shopping
list method okay so now if I go over to
active list details activity i'm here in
the oncreate method and a lot of stuff
happens I'm scrolling down but one of
the things is i get a listener that
grabs the shopping list that's the
activity shopping list bumper variable
and then passes in the shopping list
into the adapter so you could do
something kind of similar in the
activity you can grab in the activity
you can grab the shared with list and
then when that changes you can pass that
into the adapter dialogues are similarly
a little bit tricky
now you can pass in the shared users
into a new instance method much like you
would a primitive valium butchered users
is a hashmap and if you remember in the
new instance methods we're putting all
those values into a bundle so you might
be wondering how to put a hashmap into a
bundle well you can use bundles
handy-dandy put serializable method and
similarly you can pull it out of the
bundle by using bundles handy-dandy get
serializable method you just have to
remember to also cast it to hash map
alright so I'm not going to lie this is
a pretty big update but I know you're
ready for it read the spec carefully
work incrementally and reach out if you
need help I'll also go ahead and add a
link to adding log level debugging
information in the instructor notes ok
best of luck and I'll send over the spec
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
