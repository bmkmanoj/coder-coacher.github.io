consider this cube again you notice this
cube has junctions and these junctions
have different kind of shapes for
example this looks like a wide junction
this looks like an L Junction this also
looks like an L Junction is just that
the disarm of the Earl is coming in the
other direction this also looks like an
L Junction this Junction or the other
hand looks a little bit like a w
junction so junctions of various kinds
here are the kind of junctions that can
occur in the world of cry heater objects
like cubes why junction double Junction
t-junction L Junction we can see a
little bit more about each of these
junctions let us look at the wide
junction first if we examine the various
kinds of Y junctions that get formed in
the world of cry heater objects and we
find that whenever there is a why
junction formed then each of these lines
represents a fold where the fold is a
line where two surfaces meet now the
important thing about this is that if we
can infer that this is a wide junction
and that this line represents our fold
then an immediately follows that this
line must also represent a fold and this
line must also represent a fold actually
I should tell you quickly then the world
would cry Hitler objects why junctions
can have multiple kind of constraints
but right now let's just look at this
one single constraint similarly case of
an L junction which is a shape like this
in the world are pre heated objects and
L Junction is characterized by this
being a blade and this being a blade
where a blade is a line where we cannot
infer the two surfaces are getting
connected with each other again the L
constraint can actually have many more
formulations but right now we are
keeping it simple just looking at one
single constraint for the Earl Junction
similarly in the world of criteria
objects one of the ways and we see W
Junction gets characterizes through a
blade Fuld played in effect we are
defining a spatial grammar here for the
world of cry heated objects the
equivalent of this in case of grammar of
natural language sentences might be that
a sentence can have a noun phrase
ordered by the verb phrase water by
prepositional phrase and so on
given the set of very simple constraints
for the world of criteria objects let us
see how these constraints actually can
be propagated to group edges into
surfaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
