about how to scale databases now this is
like databases themselves this is a very
broad topic but there's a couple
concepts I'd like to introduce because
they're going to affect us in this class
there's two reasons you might need to
scale it database one is too much load
as in the database is just doing too
much work you know you've got some
website that is getting you know
millions of requests a day or you know
thousands of requests a second and
you've got this one machine that's got
your data on it and it just can't keep
up with all of the work so what you
might do in this case is you know take
your database which are often
represented as little cylinders and
replicate it to other databases so every
time we insert a piece of data to to
this database we we send it over to the
other guys so all of our database rights
go into this this one master database in
turn get all of that data gets
replicated to to the slave databases so
now we have three databases with all of
our data on it and so if you know you've
got a site like Reddit that's getting
thousands and thousands of requests a
second instead of sending all of the the
database reads all of the lookups to to
this database we can send it you know to
these databases and and that alleviates
a lot of this load off of this master
database now there are much more
complicated schemes where you might you
know have a multi master system or a
bunch of databases that are all working
together but this is a fairly common
common set up and a fairly common
approach to you know spreading around
the reads because generally in most
systems you have a lot more reads than
you do writes so if your master can keep
up with all of the writes your slaves
can handle all the reads there are some
downsides to this one is that it doesn't
increase the speed of writes you know
we're still bottlenecks by this one
master receiving all of this data who
has to you know in turn send it to all
of these slaves so if we can still fit
all of our writes on this one machine
we're in good shape and we can spread
the reads over you know as many machines
as we need you know some of these slaves
could even replicate to other machines
another downside is this notion of
replication lag and this occurs when you
write a piece of data to the master but
the read hits one of these slaves before
the data has propagated and that's
called replication
and you can sometimes get some funny
behavior and the reason I bring it up
now is because in the database we'll be
using this class you can occasionally
see symptoms of this type of behavior
it's not necessarily owing to a
master/slave set up but this this is the
the general concept now what happens if
you have too much data for one machine
the replication hand handles the case
where you have too much load basically
you've got to do you know too many reads
so you can replicate your database to
scale this up what if you just have too
much data you know you master database
or any one of these databases can't even
hold all of your data you know it
doesn't fit in memory or even in disk
it's just there's just too much one
things you can do is you can shard the
database and this is a fairly simple
approach where instead of having one
master you might have a couple that are
all the same size despite my drawing so
let's say we're storing on links
database won't approach the sharding
might be to store links you know 1
through 100 here actually more like 1
through a billion here and 101 to 200
here and you know 201 to 300 here and
basically you you store some of your
links here and some of your links here
and some of your links here in this
database obviously you know 1 through
100 probably isn't the correct approach
you could probably use a hashing
approach as if we had a hash table and
these were all cells in our hash table
and you you know hash on some particular
key in this case I'm referring to linked
IDs
you know the idea of whatever you're
storing to figure out which database you
want to store it this is cool because
now if we triple our write load from
from this scenario over here we have 3
database machines to to handle it
likewise we already have 3 machines to
handle the read load and of course you
can replicate these machines as well and
a lot of systems both shard and
replicate your machines if you really
want to get fancy but there are some
downsides to sharding as well you know
one of the downsides is the queries get
much more complex you know what if I
said that this helps the case of find me
the link whose ID is 150 you know we
just say ok which machine is 150 go to
and you know what hashes you know to
this machine and we do our read and
that's that what if I said get me all
the links sorted by hotness for example
well we don't know
where that link may reside especially if
we're using a hashing algorithm that's
you know more sophisticated than you
know 1 through 100
that's called a range query and a range
query might have to hit all of your
machines and you know then then we've
lost our you know one of our advantages
to using this now you could replicate
these to spread that around but you had
all these machines and then merge the
results probably and you know do the
sort again in memory and so you know
some queries become very very complex
another downside is that joins become
difficult or impossible that makes sense
you know so if we have this master
database that has multiple tables on it
you know we can do joints but if we
start charting our database up you know
we have one database doesn't fit on one
machine you know so if we can't fit one
database on our machine how are we going
to fit you know multiple databases this
notion that you have all of your tables
in the same place to do a joint to do
those fancy joint sequel queries becomes
a lot more difficult now there are
there's a lot of research going on of
building systems that can overcome these
downsides but if you take the naive
approach to replicating and charting
these are some of the things you have to
deal with now I generally the benefits
outweigh the the downsides because if
you design your data in such a way that
you don't need to do joints or you don't
need to do complex queries you're in
very good shape with both of these or
maybe you have you know multiple setups
you know once setup for handling your
general load and another setup for
handling your complex queries you know
that's ok and that's actually very
common now I wanted to introduce these
concepts because the database we'll be
using in this class Google the App
Engine data store actually has some of
these limitations you know there are no
joins allowed even though it does
provide a sequel interface and a lot of
more complex queries that you could do
in a general sequel database now you
can't do in Google datastore but that's
ok you know you get this really nice
benefit of having a database that is
charted and replicated to you know wazoo
and back it's actually very fast and
reliable you know we were probably not
going to have to worry about systems
crashing something that you know
replicating a database can help with and
charting a database can help with ok so
just wanted to introduce those concepts
let's have a quick quiz on it before we
move along
which is an appropriate technique for
increasing the read speed from a
database get a faster machine replicate
the database store less data or press
