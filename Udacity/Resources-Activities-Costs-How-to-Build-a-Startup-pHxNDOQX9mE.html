activities and costs and congratulations
this is your last lecture by now you are
intimately familiar with the business
model canvas we've talked about value
props customer segments channels
customer relationships revenue streams
we jumped ahead and talked about
partners and right now we're going to
talk about key resources and four key
resources the real question is what are
your most important assets to make your
business model happen let's see what are
some most important assets what are the
most important things that are required
to make your business model work for
every startup the thing you're always
worried about is money finance how do
you get the company started can you do
it under credit cards you know
unaccredited is a small business loan or
then physical resources do you need a
manufacturing line do you mean machines
do you need cars you need vehicles and
how about intellectual property our pets
critical to defending your position or
is it customer lists or is it people and
then that kind of gets us into what are
the key human resources you need to make
this happen
is it the world's best scientists or
programmers or engineers is there a
specific area in the country that has a
concentration of them and so when you
think about resources some of these are
just kind of natural all you have will
hire a bunch of Engineers and we'll have
a building and etcetera but actually you
could think about this strategically
geez is it possible to have headquarters
in one place like Silicon Valley but
great engineers back in our country
somewhere in Finland or Chile or Russia
or gee is there a physical manufacturing
plant best located in the United States
or do we need to put it in a place of
for lower cost manufacturing and so all
of these resources are the things that
you really need to think through even
though one day one they might not seem
important it just gets to be a bigger
and bigger problem over time if you
haven't actually approached us as a
strategy at least giving it a couple of
cycles don't when you start your company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
