basically write complicated functions in
a much simpler way so we can take a
function like one over two times N
squared and just think of it as big
theta of N squared
eight times root n we can think of as
just rude and big data of root n our
equation from before 2n minus 2 times
the square root of n just becomes big
theta event it's just a linear function
asymptotically complicated expression
like this where we have n 4 which is the
term that grows the fastest becomes big
data event the natural log of n in fact
any base log of n is big theta of well
any other base log of n as long as it's
a constant I like to think in terms of
base two logs because I'm a computer
scientist that's what we do pi squared
it's something that doesn't grow with n
and it ends up being in the set big
theta of one it's just another constant
just to beat this dead horse a little
bit longer let's use the definition of
big theta to show that this expression
that we determined for the growth in
edges in a grid to n minus two times the
square root of n really is just a linear
function it grows like big theta of n
alright so the game plan is that we need
to find constant C 1 and C 2 bigger than
zero and a threshold n zero so that for
all the N bigger than n zero the
function that we care about is
sandwiched between these two scalings so
let's focus on this one first what C 2
can we plug in here so that we're
guaranteed that this will be above this
expression so if we just copy this
inequality down just flipping it around
make it a little easier to think about
we want a C 2 so that C 2 times n is
bigger than this divide through by n so
now we need a C 2 that is bigger than 2
minus something that's actually growing
2 should work for that if we set C 2 to
2 that will satisfy this inequality
those just summarize all that we can set
C 2 equal to 2 what about C 1 well let's
take c1 2 b1 intuitively the idea being
this function is growing like 2n minus
something smaller than that so n should
be underneath of that but let's just
make sure if C 1 is equal to 1 then we
need n to be less than or equal to this
expression for what values of n is that
going to be true not true all of them
but it's true of some of them we can add
2 root n to both sides and subtract n
from both sides we get that if we divide
through by root n we get 2 less than or
equal to n
/ root N and / root n is actually R in
so we have to less than or equal to root
n we square both sides we have 4 less
than equal to n or flipping that around
the other way if n is bigger than equal
to 4 then this is true that means we
have to throw away the smaller values of
n and we can do that very simply by
setting + 0 to 4
because this only has to hold for n that
are bigger than n 0 and that's what we
got there
so there we have it if we set the
constants this way and 0 C 1 and C 2
then what we find is that for big enough
n this more complicated expression is
sandwiched between two simple linear
functions or to say it another way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
