AI at many levels abstraction so this is
the scale here low level to high level
at one level we can build theories at
the hardware level so we can talk about
the brain or transistors or this
microchip at the next level we can talk
about the kinds of methods and the kinds
of representations we have been talking
about means ant analysis that has an
algorithm associated with it a semantic
network that's a knowledge
representation in some symbolic form at
a yet higher level we can talk about
knowledge and tasks so the question here
becomes what exactly is the task that
the decision maker has to make
what exactly does acknowledge that
decision maker has so when David was
giving his answer about what the pitcher
might do in the situation I showed you
earlier
David was clearly using a lot of
knowledge and he was trying to use this
knowledge to address a particular task
now in the history of AI David Marr
talked about three levels the level of
tasks which he called the computational
theory the level of algorithms in the
level of implementation and L&amp;amp;L talked
also about multiple levels he was
talking about the knowledge level this
symbol level and lower levels like the
hardware the various levels are
connected with each other so I might
think that the hardware level is a level
for implementing what is happening at
the algorithm level and the algorithm
level provides an architecture for
implementing what is happening at the
task level and the opposite direction I
might think that the task level provides
the content of what needs to be
represented or manipulated al D
algorithm level and the algorithm and
symbol they will provide the content for
what needs to be manipulated a process
at the hardware level so as an example
one might say will represent things in a
form of a semantic network fair enough
but what exactly are going to represent
in a semantic networks that's going to
come from the knowledge level it is a
knowledge level that tells us what is
the content of the knowledge that is
required to play baseball once you have
that content of knowledge you can
perhaps implement it in many different
ways one way is through semantic network
similarly if once you know what kind of
decision you have to make and what the
decision-making process might look like
overall there might be many different
methods of making that particular
decision just like we can build a
relationship between the task level and
the algorithm level a similar
relationship exists between the
algorithm devil and the hardware level
this is an important point so let me
take another example all of you are
familiar with your standard smartphone
let us suppose that I was coming from
Mars I was a Martian and it did not know
how your mobile phone works so I would
ask you well how exactly does your
mobile phone work and you might give an
account of how the phone works at that
level abstraction that will be a
legitimate account yet somewhere else
were given account of how the smartphone
works at the level of tasks and
knowledge this person might say well the
phone allows you to communicate with
other people at long distances how that
is implemented is a different matter now
you will see I'm sure that all three of
these interpretations all three of these
descriptions are legitimate and valid
you will see also that we really need
all three of these levels of description
we do need to understand what this
smartphone does and what kind of
knowledge it uses to do it we do need to
understand what kind of algorithms and
knowledge representations it uses and
what kind of hardware implements all of
this now you can do a similar kind of
analysis for other kinds of devices
let's say like your calculator could we
do a similar kind of analysis for
intelligent agents are these different
layers also meaningful for analyzing
what happens in cognitive systems but
they are natural or artificial and at
what layer should we be building a
theory our hypothesis is that these
three layers are also useful for trying
to analyze how cognitive systems might
work both natural cognitive systems and
artificial cognitive systems further our
hypothesis is that we want to build
theories at all three of these different
levels of abstraction not at any one of
them in fact their constraints flowing
in both directions if we know about what
kind of tasks we want to do and what
kind of knowledge we want to use then if
that tells us something about
what kind of algorithms we need and what
kind of knowledge representations we
need and that tells about something
about what kind of hardware we need in
the other direction if we know what kind
of hardware we have that imposes
constraints and provides affordances for
what kind of algorithms and knowledge
representations can be there which then
provides affordances and constraints
what kind of tasks can be done and what
kind of knowledge can be used in this
class we'll be concerned mostly with the
top two layers although I'll allude
occasionally to the third layer as well
a lot of work in AI is at the top two
layers of abstraction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
