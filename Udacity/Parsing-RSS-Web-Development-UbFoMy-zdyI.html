writing is 16 and if it's actually
different from 16 we'll have our grading
script update accordingly let me show
you how I arrived to this answer oh so
here we are in Python I first import the
libraries I need URL lib to and mini Dom
okay and then I download the New York
Times page i'm going to use URL lib to
URL open and paste in the URL and we go
ahead and call read on that to download
the contents and we're going to store
that on a variable called contents we
can take a peek at contents there we go
a lot of stuff and it looks like RSS we
can see the closing RSS tag there now
we're going to parse this with mini Dom
ok that worked got a variable D it's got
a document instance and i'm going to use
get elements by tag name item to find
all of those so let's give this a whirl
success and then we just run length on
this ok and the answer is 18 so grading
this is actually going to be a little
tricky for us all we wanted you to do is
go through this process so hopefully
that worked out for you and you got a
number and hopefully we managed to grade
that number that's how you parse some
basic XML I think you can see probably
the value here and that many web pages
have XML interfaces them or RSS
interfaces to them where you can
actually download their content and
manipulate it from a program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
