review mixed numbers and improper
fractions mixed numbers are a way to
count objects when we have a couple of
objects and a part of that object so
here I have two donuts and then I have
two thirds of one I can think about
splitting up a whole doughnut into three
equal pieces or thirds and I'd have two
thirds so our entire mixed number would
be two and two thirds notice we have a
mixture of whole numbers and fractions
that's what we call these mixed numbers
if I split all of my Donuts up into
thirds
I could count the pieces and I were to
have eight thirds that would be the
improper fraction it's improper because
the number in the numerator is higher
than the number in the denominator so
let's see how we can go from the mixed
number to the improper fraction if I
take my whole Donuts and split them up
into thirds I would have six of them six
thirds I can get that by multiplying 3
times 2 I still have two thirds leftover
so I need to add this two thirds to my
six thirds six plus two makes eight so I
get eight thirds let's try going the
other way I can think about splitting
eight thirds into six thirds and two
thirds
notice that the six thirds represents my
two whole Donuts
I know six divided by three makes two
and then I have my two thirds leftover
so two and two thirds this also makes
sense because I know 3 goes into 8 two
full times and then I would have a
remainder of two or two thirds leftover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
