wherever you happen to be this is John
and I'll be presenting unit 1 so let's
get started like a lot of American kids
when I was probably six years old I
tried to dig a hole to China I know I'm
not the only kid who tried this so in
general you can probably conclude that
American kids are a ambitious and B not
particularly good at geography at least
when they're six years old
needless to say I was not successful why
besides having the attention span of a
gnat
I just couldn't dig a hole fast enough
so the question I'd like to pose today
is how could you dig a hole faster I'll
submit there's three ways I could have
gone faster one dig faster instead of
say removing one shovel full of dirt
every two seconds maybe with a lot of
effort I could have removed one
shovelful every second this certainly
would help but I think we can all agree
that there's a limit to this speeding up
it's not likely I could go ten times as
fast no matter how hard I work my shovel
would probably explode to buy a more
productive shovel let's say shovel with
two or even three blades instead of one
an interesting approach perhaps a better
shovel would make me more productive but
again I think we can agree this
diminishing returns and making shovels
better it's not likely I could use a 10
or 20 bladed shovel number three hire
more diggers I have a younger sister and
a brother perhaps I could have persuaded
them to help me dig faster this is
probably the approach that would have
been most productive overall toward my
hole digging project of course adding
more diggers comes with its own problems
how do I manage them will they get in
each other's way
well more diggers help me dig my hole
deeper instead of just wider well as you
probably figured out I'm not just
talking about digging holes each of
these three methods for digging holes
faster has a parallel in terms of
building a faster processor when I talk
about digging faster I'm actually
talking about asking our processors to
run with a faster clock to spend a
shorter amount of time on each step of a
computation however in a modern
processor turning up clock speed also
increases power consumption and we're at
the limit as far as power consumption on
a chip when I talk about buying a more
productive shovel I'm actually talking
about asking our processor to do more
work on each step on each clock cycle
but like the super shovel a single
processor has also reached diminishing
returns on how much work it can do per
cycle to be a little more technical the
most advanced CPUs are at a limit as far
as how much instruction level
parallelism they can extract per clock
cycle and when I talk about hire more
diggers I'm referring to parallel
computing in the way that we hope to
teach you in this class instead of
having one fast digger with an awesome
shovel we're going to have mini diggers
with many shovels instead of having one
or just a few very powerful processors
we're going to have many many weaker
less powerful processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
