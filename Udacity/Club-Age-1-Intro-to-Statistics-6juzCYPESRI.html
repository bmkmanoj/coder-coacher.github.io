sample you know how to compute a comfort
zone if your knowledge what this is is
inside the converse interval of the
observed sample everything is okay and
you believe the null hypothesis
conversely if in a lipolysis falls
outside you don't believe null
hypothesis and you accept the
alternative policies so simple is he
part of this testing and use confidence
intervals instead of for example the
binomial distribution and that's really
the common case so let me just briefly
summarize what you're doing given the
sample or data you compute the mean you
compute the variance you get the t value
at some desired error probability P and
you have to make sure you pick the
correct one if it's one-sided you pick a
different one from the two-sided and
then the plus minus term in the
confidence interval is simply this
number over here times the square root
of the empirical variance all right then
I with them would have looked really
cryptic we're just giving it to you but
by now it should make a lot of sense
because you've practice every element of
it the mean the empirical variance
getting a number from a table and then
compute the size of the confidence of lv
cheng put into the plus/minus jump so mu
minus this is the lower bound nu plus s
is the upper bound of the line of the
confidence interval according to the
confidence level specify the error
probability P so let's put this into
action a dance club operator advertise
the fact that the average age of its
client is 26 you walk in and encounter
the following people for people are 20
16 people are 24 7 people at 26 11
people are 29
and two people are actually 40 years old
for a total of n equal 30 people now
compute for me whether you know trust
the statement the average age is 26 and
let's do so obviously the fact that
there's 240 old is a little bit
disturbing so let's do so in stages I'm
going to guide you through this first
let's calculate the mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
