using conditional probability so the
event that we saw was the ciphertext so
that's the encryption of M what we want
to know is whether the message is equal
to M star both of those are selected
drawn from the set of possible messages
and in order for the attacker to know
nothing well that's the same as the
probability that the message is M star
without knowing the cipher text the
first answer would be correct if a
priori the attacker knew nothing about
the messages all the attacker noses each
message is equally likely in that case
the probability that the message is M
star would be 1 over the number of
possible messages not depending on the
ciphertext
the problem is the attacker might know
something more they might know that some
messages are more likely than others in
most realistic scenarios this is the
case the attacker knows that well the
message is likely to be a valid sentence
in English very few possible bit
sequences correspond to that so all
messages are not equally likely so
that's why choice 1 is not the
definition we want we want choice to
wear whatever the TEC are already knew
about the probability of the message is
M star is not affected in any way by
seeing the ciphertext so that's our
definition of a perfect cipher now the
question is can we prove that the
one-time pad has this property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
