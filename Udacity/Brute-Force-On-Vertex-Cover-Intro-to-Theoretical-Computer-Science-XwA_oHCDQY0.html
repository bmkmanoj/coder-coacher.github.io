Alice who was working on vertex cover
and actually last time we left off Alice
wasn't wasn't happy like that actually
Alice was quite unhappy because we
proved vertex cover to be np-complete so
last time we left off there was little
hope for her to ever solve her a vertex
cover problem that she's working on now
I promised to show you an intelligent
algorithm for vertex cover at least one
that's more intelligent than brute force
but in order to do that let's first
start out with the brute force algorithm
so let's say Alice is running her
algorithm on a very simple graph like
this just four vertices and five edges
what her simple algorithm or brute-force
algorithm was doing it was considering
all possible assignments of 0 and 1 to
the vertices so for 4 vertices we had a
total of 16 possibilities that her
algorithm needed to look at so her
algorithm starts out for example by
saying oh let's put no vertices into the
vertex cover and of course this leaves
all edges uncovered so it's not even a
valid solution then it would maybe start
out by saying oh let's put one vertex
into the vertex cover there's actually
four different ways of doing this and at
least this time we have some edges
covered but so none of these solutions
is a valid solution because we still
have uncovered edges and I've drawn the
red here so you can better see them so
no valid solution for any of those the
algorithm continues and says oh then
let's put two vertices into the vertex
cover and finally the algorithm has
found a valid vertex cover for a small
network but of course it has also found
many many vertex covers that are
actually invalid because not all edges
are covered so again redundant redundant
redundant and now the algorithm proceeds
and although it has already found a
solution where two vertices are enough
for the vertex cover and outputs three
vertices into the vertex cover which has
the advantage that it will always find a
valid vertex cover but the disadvantage
that it's totally redundant and
unnecessary work same thing if you put
all four into the vertex cover valid
solutions but not the best possible ones
so this is what her brute-force
algorithm is doing and you can see why
brute-force is so stupid because first
of all it considers many solutions where
you could have immediately said look
this is not valid you've taken an edge
and
none of the two end points is in the
vertex cover so why even consider all
the other possibilities as soon as you
have an edge that is not covered you can
basically scrap that solution and go
looking for another one and the other
thing that her algorithm did that wasn't
very smart was once it had found a
solution with two vertices it still
tried all the solutions with three
vertices and four vertices it could have
stopped right here because it knew that
it would not be able to find any vertex
cover that is smaller and that is the
difference between brute force and
intelligent force so in brute force we
go through all of the possible
assignments of the vertices into the
vertex cover out of the vertex cover
where as what we're now going to do is
we're going to avoid stupid choices and
that is the basis for intelligent force</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
