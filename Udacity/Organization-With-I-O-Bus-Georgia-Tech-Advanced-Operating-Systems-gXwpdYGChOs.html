the hardware resources inside a computer
system with an i/o bus and a system bus
and usually the system bus is a
synchronous communication device between
the CPU and the memory the i/o bus is
primarily intended for the devices to
communicate with the CPU and the intent
is that the individual needs of each of
these devices in terms of the
communication bandwidth that they may
need is less than the cumulative
bandwidth that may be available for the
CPU to communicate with the memory or in
other words the system bus has a
communication bandwidth that is much
more than the communication bandwidth
that's available in the i/o bus so the
system bus is a high speed bus and it
connects via a bridge to the i/o bus and
the bridge itself could be a specialized
IO processor for scheduling the devices
that need to communicate with the memory
for instance if it is a DMA device or
need to communicate with a CPU if it's a
slow-speed device so the role of the
bridge is like a processor in itself
controlling who has access to this i/o
bus among the set of devices that may be
competing at the same time for attention
by the CPU and communicating the intent
of these i/o devices either directly
with the memory or via the CPU the i/o
bus is typically lower speed than the
high speed system bus and the cumulative
bandwidth that is needed on the system
bus is usually much higher because it
has to cater to all the clients that may
want to access the memory either from
the CPU or from any of these devices
coming through this bridge there will be
other high speed devices for example a
frame buffer of a graphics display that
may also be hanging off of the system
bus due to the need for refreshing the
screen in a rapid manner from the memory
so in a nutshell if you look at the
internal organization of a computer
system there are going to be one or more
CPUs whether it is a single core machine
or multi core machine or a parallel
machine and so on you're going to have
one or more CPUs and you're going to
have a bunch of memory that the CPUs can
access and there's going to be a whole
number of input/output devices and
device controllers that allow these
devices to communicate with the CPU or
directly with the memory and there are
conduits system bus and i/o bus for
connecting these controllers to the CPU
as well as to the memory basically these
conduits allow varying data from the CPU
to the devices or from the devices to
the CPU and between CPU and the memory
as well as from the devices to the
memory this is why I mentioned earlier
that there is no difference in the
organization regardless of the platform
specifics the form factor may be
different or the intended use may be
different of a particular platform but
the internal organization is pretty much
going to look as I've shown you here in
terms of the hardware elements that are
going to be there as well as the
connectivity that you might see among
these Hardware elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
