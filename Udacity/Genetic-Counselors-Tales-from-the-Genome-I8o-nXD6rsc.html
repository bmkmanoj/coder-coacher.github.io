will inherit a particular trait is what
genetic counselors do for a living and
sometimes all they have to rely on is
pedigree information this is tricky
business this means they've got to
calculate probability over multiple
generations without knowing the
genotypes for sure of everybody but only
knowing whether or not a trait was
present in a family for example take a
look at this pedigree here it represents
an autosomal recessive inheritance
pattern what is the probability that
these two people indicated by the arrows
will have an affected child for this
particular trait now I'm not going to
give you options for this question this
is going to be tricky and possibly
really hard for you to come up with but
I want you to see what it's like a
little bit to try to do the job of a
genetic counselor calculating
probabilities from a limited amount of
information I want you to feel
comfortable putting in a percentage a
decimal or fraction whatever answer you
can come up with remember you're
probably going to have to think
backwards about whose genotype is what
based on the phenotypic information that
you have in front of you go ahead and
give it your best shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
