need a minute what you writing well why
why are you looking at my email let me
see what you're doing okay fine I'm
sending an email to a friend to uh which
has instructions on how to uh feed Chloe
of kulli Oh close my office plant you
named your office and Chloe yeah Chloe
for chlorophyll clever look okay you
know what this reminds me of what these
instructions are similar to how we write
code to tell a computer what to do you
know everything reminds you of how to
write instructions or code Catherine
does but I'm serious this time it does
okay like like here this line where
you're saying that you need to water the
plant exactly a Tuesday at 10 o'clock
right so when I'm giving specific
instructions on Tuesdays and Thursdays
water the plant or make sure the water
is lukewarm those specific instructions
are like writing code exactly okay and
you know how you're writing this letter
in an email app yeah I'm using Gmail
good choice mm-hmm just Park we also
need a face to write our code sure and
that space is called an IDE what does
that stand for stands for integrated
development environment I am more
confused after listening to the full
form of that acronym when I was but I
heard the economy well don't worry about
what it stands for and Android all you
need to know is that we're going to use
Android studio is that on this computer
that's off here it's right here let me
show you oh and this is what it looks
like yeah you know I must admit that
this looks a little bit intimidating it
has a lot of buttons on it it is there's
a lot of things going on yet we'll get
there
by the end of the course the students
will know how to operate this yeah okay
good cool so back to your letter okay oh
you know how you're using English to
write this letter well it's a great
observation I thought you said you were
not reading my email but yes I am using
English okay well we have to use a
certain language to talk to the computer
short instructions what are we using
we're gonna start with XML you know
Catherine you would have been of
three-letter acronyms it seems first IDE
now XML
what does XML stand for it stands for
extensible
markup language extensible markup
language
what does extensible ml do it is a way
to describe how your Android app is
going to look okay we can use it to
build layouts okay so where you're going
to place things what things you're going
to place on the phone Factory okay well
there's a lot going on in this video so
let's just do a quick recap right we're
talking about how writing code is like
writing instructions really specific
instructions right
we're also talking about how we need a
space within which to write that code
and as faithful the Android studio and
we also identified the programming
language we will be using which is XML
so let's write our first line of XML
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
