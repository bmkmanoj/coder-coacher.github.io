one of the things that my colleague and
I have been working on is a whole entire
book that actually attends to the role
of Technology and couple and family
relationships because even though
there's been a ton of research in the
field of communication in the field of
of Technology and cyber technologies and
digital stuff there's been very little
research in the field that looks at
relationships in the context of
technology and technology in the context
of relationships so what we did was
wrote a book called the couple and
family technology framework intimate
relationships in a digital age and what
we did was we synthesized what little
research there is in the field of
relationships and technology and then
all those other disciplines put it into
one book and we really try to get people
to think about things like the role of
Technology in your sexual relationships
with each other is being friends on a
social networking site for example with
an ex is that okay is it not okay is
just chatting with people infidelity is
watching pornography a form of
infidelity when is the appropriate age
for children to get cell phones when
should they be on social networking
sites should they be playing games how
will that influence them how do we make
sure that our kids have access to
comprehensive sex education that we can
monitor while blocking sites that we
don't want them to have access to
because it's not age-appropriate yet so
all of these things are things that are
really emerging couples families
individual are experiencing them but
there's been very little written about
it and not really a comprehensive way
for people to look at it and so our hope
is that our book is going to be really a
big step in a beginning of really this
revolution of this field of couple and
family technology now if you're
interested in learning more about any of
these topics which I highly suggest you
do check out dr. mark ii bloomers
website or the book she co-authored
