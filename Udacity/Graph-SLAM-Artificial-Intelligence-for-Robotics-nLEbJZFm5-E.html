of all called graph slam this is one of
many methods for slam and this abundance
by far the easiest to explain let's
assume we have a robot and it's called
arbitrarily the initial location x
equals 0 and y equals 0 for this example
we just assume the board has a perfect
compass and we don't care about heading
direction just to keep things simple and
let's assume the robot moves to the
right in X direction by 10 so it's now
over here in a perfect world you would
know that x1 the location after motion
is the same as X 0 plus 10 and y1 is the
same as y 0 but we learn from our
various robotic comment further lessons
and others that the location is actually
uncertain so rather than assuming in our
XY coordinate system the robot moves to
the right by 10 exactly we know that the
actual location is a Gaussian centered
around 10 0 but it's possible to over
the some rails remember we've worked out
the math for this Gaussian here's how it
looks like just for the X variable
rather than setting X 1 to X 0 plus 10
we try to express the Gaussian that's
Peaks when these two things are the same
so if you subtract from x1 x0 and 10 put
this into a square format and turn this
into a Gaussian we get a probability
distribution that relates x1 and x0 we
can do the same for Y and since there's
no change in Y according to our motion
all we ask is that y 1 and y 0 are as
close together as possible the product
of these two gaussians is now our
constraint we wish to maximize the
likelihood of the position x1 given the
deposition x0 is 0 0
so what graph slam does is defining our
probabilities using a sequence of such
constraints say we have a robot that
moves in some space and each location is
now characterized by vector x0 and a
vector X 1 vector X 2 X 2 X 3 often
they're three dimensional vectors then
we'll graph some color
is initial location which is a zero zero
zero usually although here looks a
little bit different and then really
importantly lots of relative constraints
that relate each robot pose to the
previous world pose we call the relative
motion constraints you can think of
those as rubber bands in expectation
this rubber band will be exactly the
motion the robot sensed or commanded but
in reality it might have to bend it a
little bit to make the map more
consistent and speaking about maps let's
use landmass as an example so suppose
has a landmark out here and the landmark
is being seen from the robot with some
relative measurement 0 z1 perhaps I
didn't even see it time to button this
is z3 all these are also relative
constraints very much like the ones
before again they captured by gaussians
and we get relative measurement
constraints one such constrained every
time the robot sees the landmark so
graph slam collects those constraints
and as we'll see they're insanely easy
to collect and it just relaxes the set
of rubber bands to find the most likely
configuration of over path along with
the location of landmarks and that is
the mapping process let me ask you a
quick quiz it'll take some thinking
suppose we have six robot poses that is
one initial and five motions and we have
eight measurements of landmarks that
we've seen this might be multiple
landmarks I'm not above it so more than
one the question now is how many total
constraints do we have if we count each
of these constraint for exactly one
constraint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
