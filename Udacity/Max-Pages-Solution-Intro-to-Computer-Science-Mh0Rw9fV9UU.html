a little smaller than the real internet
but it'll be a good example for showing
how we want to modify the crawler to
solve the max pages problem the problem
asks us to stop the crawler from
crawling the internet after we've
reached a certain number of pages so if
this were the real internet there'd be a
lot more links we'd have links going
basically for practically ever there's
billions of pages on the internet and if
we took the code that we've had at the
end of this unit then the crawler would
go on for a very very long time I leave
it up to you to estimate how long it
would take but longer than this course
has time available so what we want to do
for all practical reasons is have the
crawler stop after reaching numbers
certain number of pages so that's pretty
easy to do if we just count the number
of pages that we've seen as we go
through our sample internet and simply
check it against the max page is passed
into the function so if we say max pages
is equal to 3 what our crawler is going
to do is start with a from a we're going
to crawl a and get B and C then we're
going to crawl see and get D and E but
we now have crawled three pages so we
want to stop the process let's look at
the code that we had at the end of the
unit and modify it to do exactly this
here we have the crawl web function we
take in a parameter max pages and we
want to stop crawling once we've hit
that number of pages crawled an easy way
to check is to simply look at the length
of the crawled list and we get that by
using the Len operator so we don't only
want to crawl a page if it hasn't been
crawled but we also only want to crawl
it if the length of the crowd list is
less than max pages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
