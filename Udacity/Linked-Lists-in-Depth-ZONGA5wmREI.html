there often isn't a distinction between
linked lists and arrays there's just a
list that has the properties of both
however questions about these two data
structures are fairly common in
interviews so it's important to know the
difference again the main distinction is
that each element stores different
information in both cases a single
element will store of value or the
actual information so if you have an
array or length list of numbers the
value will be a single number if you
have an array or linked lists of string
values then each value will contain a
string in this case we're just going to
stick with numbers now in both cases we
store one other type of information but
that type is different in an array we
would store a number as an index you can
get the next element by querying the
array for the element at index one in
this case let's clear this out and focus
just a linked list for now in a linked
list we store a reference to the next
element in the list in many languages
this will look like assigning the actual
next element as a property of this
element way down at the hardware level
your element actually has some space
dedicated for it in memory these are
representing the memory locations so in
this case the next component is actually
storing the memory address of the next
element while this element is storing
null because it doesn't point to
anything else the nice thing about this
system is that it's pretty easy to
insert and delete elements adding an
element is going to look something like
this we really just need to change the
next reference to point to the new
object and done there's a quick trick
you need to remember though if you
delete the next reference and replace it
with a new object you'll lose your
reference to this object you should
always assign your next pointer for this
element before you assign your next
pointer for this element so you don't
lose your reference to this one down
here now everything looks great
note that insertion takes constant time
in this case since you're just shifting
around pointers and not iterating over
every element in the list removing an
is going to look pretty similar so I'm
not even going to go over that now
there's also something called a doubly
linked list where you have pointers to
the next element and the previous
element the rules are pretty similar for
a doubly linked list except you can
traverse the list in both directions now
again you need to be careful not to lose
references when adding or removing
elements but it's easier than performing
these operations on an array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
