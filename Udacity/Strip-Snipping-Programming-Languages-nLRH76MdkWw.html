redundancy in our handling of quoted
strings we returned the entire matched
text which includes these double quotes
at the end but in some sense they're not
as much part of the meaning as they are
beginning and ending markers to tell us
when the string starts this is our
default token' value but we might want
to take a small pair of scissors to this
string and snip off the quotes at the
beginning and at the end here we have an
example of a token definition that does
just that after matching the right kind
of string we take the token value the
entire thing and we're going to use
substring selection starting at
character one this is going to be
character one and going up to but not
including character negative 1 now if
you haven't seen this trick before in
Python this might surprise you a bit but
you can count back from the end of the
string using negative numbers so this is
actually the negative first character
and remember that substring inclusion
starts at one and goes up to but not
including the negative one so this is
going to get everything from the Q over
to the essence strings or in other words
have exactly the effect that we wanted
cute little trick huh so now I'm going
to show you how to make a lexical
analyzer which recall is just a bunch of
token definitions put together I'm going
to write it out in Python and we'll
follow along this top line the import
statement is a lot like import re it's
telling Python where to find our lexical
analyzer software or libraries that
we're going to build upon just like
regular expressions were called re to
save space a lexical analyzer is just
called Lex to save space and now i'm
going to give a list of all of the
tokens that I care about here I'm just
going to be concerned with the six that
we've previously spoken about the left
angle bracket the left angle bracket
followed by a slash the right angle
bracket these three make tags an equal
sign
strings that are surrounded by quotes
and every other word i'm also going to
use a little shortcut before we used a
white space token but if you like you
can write the word token ignore instead
and implicitly will ignore everything
matching this regular expression here's
my first token definition rule it's for
left angle / here's the regular
expression that it matches we return the
text unchanged here's another rule for
the left angle bracket the regular
expression that it matches and we return
the text unchanged and you'll note that
I have the left angle / rule ahead
before it in the file and that's because
I want this one to win on ties if I see
a left angle followed by a slash I want
it to be the left angle / token and not
the left angle followed by say a word
token more on that in just a bit I'll
test that out and show to you here's our
rule for the right angle bracket use our
rule for the equal sign token note that
while these are long they take up a bit
of space they're not actually
particularly complicated this has mostly
been listing five regular expressions
here's one now this one is a little bit
more complicated here's our rule for
string tokens here's our regular
expression that matches it and there I
am dropping off shaving off the
surrounding double quotes just as you've
seen before finally there's our
definition for the word token and now
what we want to do is use these regular
expressions together these token
definitions to break up a webpage so
here I'll make a variable that holds the
text of a hypothetical webpage this is
my webpage let's make it more exciting
hoho this is at least ten percent more
exciting this function call tells our
lexical analysis library that we want to
use all of the token definitions above
to make a lexical analyzer and break up
strings this function call tells it
which string to break up I want to break
up this webpage this is my webpage now
recall that the output of a lexical
analyzer is a list of tokens I want to
print out every element of that list
this call dot token returns the net
token that's available if there are no
more tokens then we're going to break
out of this loop otherwise we print out
the token let's go see what sort of
output we get the odds of me having
written this making no mistakes the
first time from scratch are about zero
let's go see what happens oh I actually
don't really believe it we can see the
output here at the bottom Lex token word
th is but it's not quite the output I
was expecting oh here's the mistake that
I made right now I only have one
character in T word if you look down
here instead of seeing the word this for
this is my webpage I have each letter
spelled out separately let you fix that
and now we get more of the output that
we are expecting our first token is this
our next token is a word is then we saw
the left angle bracket a word B for bold
the right angle bracket a word my the
left angle / and then the word webpage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
