and how programs that have this well in
ability can get exploited in particular
letting attackers or giving them the
ability to execute arbitrary code with
the host services go villages it's not a
good thing you know we shouldn't write
code that has those vulnerabilities but
if such code is out there deployed on
systems we need to find ways to defend
against attacks that are going to
exploit these kind of vulnerabilities so
we're going to talk about a number of
Defense's that help us counter attacks
that rely on on this buffer overflows
the first one you're going to talk about
is your choice of programming language
what language are you writing your
program in there are actually going to
be languages where this kind of problem
goes away you don't have buffer
overflows and these languages are
languages that are strongly typed that
do a lot of memory management they do
automatically so they do bounds check
remember one of the problems that we had
was that we declared a string variable
of size 12 and we said you can read any
amount into it there is no way unless I
explicitly inserted a check the language
didn't do that unless I explicitly
inserted a check that says giving him
more than 12 bytes that's not good the
language didn't stop me from clobbering
whatever was next to the password string
that we had not all languages do that
their language that say you have an
object of size this this is how much it
could be it can't be any more so what
type of variable it is
how much memory is required for it or is
allocated to it and how much memory you
can access when you access that variable
this bounds check that we're talking
about and if you manage sort of this
memory automatically the problem of
memory overflow or abusing memory the
way we did when we have a fair overflows
that goes away so languages that do are
called safe languages because you can
rely on type safety and you don't make
these kind of mistakes so there example
several examples of this language is
Java C++ and other
so if you write code in these kind of
languages that have five safety and that
do the kind of things that we're talking
about buffer overflow would not be a
problem the buffer overflow typically
comes because we don't do either strong
type checking or this bounced check that
I was talking about which is the low
level kind of languages are notorious
for that but these object-oriented
strongly typed languages make that
problem go away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
