machinery that carry out the process of
translation then that means they're
going to take the mRNA sequence read it
codon by codon and spit out an amino
acid for each codon okay using only the
one letter abbreviations for the amino
acids I want you to tell me what would
be the sequence for this mRNA here it is
a CAG Aug si si so forth and so on and
there are six possible answers and what
I need you to do is try to use the
genetic code over here to try to figure
out what would the sequence of amino
acids be if you were the ribosome and
you had to translate this sequence I
want you to think about this question
it's not an easy one it's not meant to
be a trick question but you do need to
think about it I want you to try to get
it right the first go-round
but it's okay if you don't you can look
at the genetic code again try to see
what you did wrong if you get stuck go
to the forums
see if anyone else has some helpful
advice and try again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
