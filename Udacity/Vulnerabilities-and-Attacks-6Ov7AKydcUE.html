vulnerabilities so the vulnerabilities
could be of many kind for example if you
use a weak password that is a
vulnerability someone can guess that
password and then be able to use that to
launch an attack which in this case
would be taking control of your account
if they're able to take control of your
account well that is a compromise of
your account if they're able to do it
more broadly to a system that's a
security breach so an attack is a
successful exploitation of a
vulnerability by a threat source
resulting in this system that has been
compromised
unfortunately Wallner parties are very
hard to get rid of completely and they
can be found in software that runs on
our computer systems networks and a lot
of times the biggest source of
vulnerability people say humans are the
weak link we do things that actually
introduce vulnerability into the systems
so the security mindset starts with
threats then we have to talk about
vulnerabilities and exploitation of
those leading to attacks and attacks
result in compromise and security
breaches we're going to use a really
simple example you can call it a trivial
example to illustrate this idea of a
vulnerability and attack so many of us
ride our bikes and of course it's an
important asset to us it costs money to
get one you know it gets you around so
obviously it's useful to you so it's the
valuable asset there are threats against
it people steal bikes let's think about
if you just leave it anywhere obviously
there is a serious one abilities in it
the thief can walk and take the bike
away so what we normally do is we lock
it so as you see in this graphic this
person who's security conscious actually
has locked the bike and they go off to
class or to work or whatever it is and
you look at this system and you say well
are there any vulnerabilities whatever
it is some we may actually know about
others may not even know about it's the
threat actor
actually discovers it and in
cybersecurity we call them zero day the
thief actually is not gonna fight the
security you have in place here which is
a lock instead what its gonna do is it's
gonna walk away with the bike - the
wheel so the vulnerability here was that
this asset that we have here the bike of
course a people have to buy a new wheel
but what he or she is able to walk away
with is actually still fairly valuable
isn't it it's most of the bike at a
wheel and and you have a functioning
bike so the vulnerability we never
thought was that we had to secure more
than just the wheel the lock that we put
is actually only protecting the wheel
it's not protecting the entire bike
that's the example of a vulnerability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
