hardness meaning how hard is a specific
input to solve as a combination of two
things one is I think the size of the
input and we always measure this as a
number n but the other thing is the
structure of the input in a way it's not
larger instances are harder to solve but
in a way you could say harder instances
are harder to solve this of course might
seem like a bit nit picking around so
the question is is this actually useful
and the answer is yes for some problems
you can actually express the structure
of the input and I'm soon going to show
you how to do that as a number K and
while in classical NP completeness so to
say you would measure hardness as some
function of n you can then measure
hardness as a function of two parameters
one parameter is still the size of the
input and the other parameter is going
to specify something about the structure
of the input now this might sound a bit
abstract so what could this parameter be
and I'm going to show you two
possibilities for this parameter and
we're going to discuss them in detail
one is size of the solution and the
other one is something I would call
distance from triviality so for example
for the network from the last quiz you
could actually see that both parameters
could tell us that finding a solution
here is easy because first of all the
solution here and optimum vertex cover
is very small you only require one
vertex and also you could argue that
this graph here is very trivial because
all you need is a pre-processing rule to
actually find the best possible solution
but again we'll get into more detail
let's start out with the size of the
solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
