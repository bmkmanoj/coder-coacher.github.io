number of elements per row what we've
just seen is that the thread per element
approach is insensitive to the structure
of the matrix whereas if we have a
varying number of elements per row
thread per row suffers from load
imbalance and it has a runtime dependent
on the longest row so of these two
methods thread per element is probably a
better choice it's completely
insensitive to the structure of the
matrix but on the other hand if our
matrices have roughly the same number of
elements in each row which is better
well now there's really no load
imbalance issues and that's the primary
disadvantage with the thread per row
approach and in this case where we have
a similar number of elements per row it
turns out that thread per row is roughly
three times faster than thread per
element how come well in thread per row
all of the partial products are
accumulated within a single thread so
they're gonna communicate through
registers and there's no communication
between threads at all and thread per
element on the other hand the segmented
scan operation requires communicating
between threads to sum up the partial
products that communication is more
expensive so because we have different
performance characteristics here it's
kind of a head-scratcher problem which
data structure do we choose given that
we probably don't know what the
structure of the matrix is before we
need to make this call</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
