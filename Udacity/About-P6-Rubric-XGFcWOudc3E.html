project and after the map I got to say
that this project is a lot less
intimidating it's actually pretty
straightforward and fairly easy there's
a few little gotchas in there that you
got to be careful of specifically with
sort of the asynchronous tests but
overall I think this project is quite a
bit easier than than that because you're
really not starting from scratch you're
starting from a project that's been
handed to you that you need to write
tests for so then you can begin
expanding on it more and believe it or
not this is I would say this is pretty
common that you might like get a piece
of code or you're working on a project
and you you know someone hasn't put put
time to add tests to it and you're asked
to write tests for it I know I'm pretty
bad about you know doing a test driven
design myself I always implement the
thing and then like I should probably
add a test to check that in the future
when you should be writing the test
first and then implementing the the tool
or design or whatever you're trying to
do but specifically for this project
let's let's take a look at what we're
going to be given here so we're going to
be given this Udacity feed site which is
your standard you know RSS feed with
some articles from Udacity you know go
in and read these articles it's actually
pretty usable it's got like a little
awesome pop outside navigation I mean
like I can follow these links and it
actually takes me to the blog so it's a
pretty usable site and it actually works
really well but we need to actually add
some tests in here to make sure these
things stay working well when we want to
add extra functionality to it and as you
can see on the bottom here there's sort
of this big gray block sections little
Jasmine symbol and this is sort of our
test suite inspector section so in this
project we're going to be using a
testing suite called jasmine
and it's it's really awesome I really
like it it makes writing tests really
simple and in a very readable way like
writing the test it's almost feels like
writing a sentence which is fantastic
and and you can see here that I'm not
failing anything so I know my the tests
I've written are working correctly
awesome um but let's talk a little bit
about sort of what we're expecting for
this project and what might be some
gotchas in the rubric that we can clear
up now so the first criteria we're
looking for is test coverage we're
asking that the required test with a
project are all provided and our
comprehensive enough to adequately test
the functionality this part should be
pretty straightforward Mike Wales went
through a lot of effort to make sure the
comments were very clear on what
functionality we're trying to solve and
what we're looking for and so you should
definitely read the comments and then
work on what tests you want to create
the sort of gotcha part I think is in
the Exede specification so if you're
looking for your project to really
exceed what we're asking for we asked
that students add additional tests
beyond those required that adequately
tested itional features within the
application students should provide
documentation within the readme
describing these feature features one of
the things we said right in here that I
think students are a little like whoa do
I have to actually do this is you can
actually write tests for future features
you plan to add so there's something
that you don't like about the RSS feed
or you can think of a way to improve it
or maybe there's some sort of feed
reader that you've seen out there that
you really like and there's some
functionality and you think would be
really cool to add you can write a test
for that and then we get the question
back all the time is okay well do I
actually have to implement that or do I
just have to write the test for it and
we're saying you only have to write the
test for it but in the readme please
describe what that feature would be what
the test is looking
for and explain in a little bit of
detail about how you might go
implementing that feature you don't have
to implement it though but we would like
you to have sort of a clear idea of what
that feature is and what kind of test
you would need to to test it out with
the next thing is test results and
that's all required tests for the
project cast this is pretty easy if
you've written all the tests
successfully you should see that when
you load the project that that Jasmine
area doesn't come up with any errors
it's all going to be green it's going to
say that all eight specs past that
should be a pretty good indicator that
you're on the right track there as far
as the exceeding specifications for that
section if student adds additional tests
these tests are allowed to fail as they
may be testing for future features that
have not been developed so that goes
back to right do I actually have to
create these no you don't it's okay if
those ones fail as well because these
aren't features that you implemented yet
um the rest is pretty straightforward I
mean code quality I think at this point
you guys have read through the style
guide plenty of times or at are already
writing code that's decently styled
comments right should be pretty
straightforward make sure you do comment
your code and make sure to add comments
if you're doing anything really strange
and then make sure to include a read
mean with this project especially if
you're looking to exceed and you need to
explain those future features so one
thing I always like to do when demoing
this project is kind of show you how you
can test to make sure your specs are
actually working so it's it's always
nice when you write a spec and it's
passing so it's really cool when your
page looks like this and everything is
passing but you might be asking yourself
did what I do actually work so an easy
way to test that up open our terminal
here and open up our project is to
break the project itself so if we look
inside our you do feed radiator we
should see that we have a test here that
says that all the beads should be
defined and all the feeds length
shouldn't be 0 in this test what we're
looking for is that all our feeds are to
be defined and healthy its length must
be serious so let's figure out where all
feeds are so if we look in our app dot
jst file will see that there is this
variable defined called all feeds and
according to our test spec we're saying
that this should be defined so let's uh
let's just delete delete this and save
and go back to our test here and
refreshing to see what happens oh gosh
so many failures but specifically we see
that reference error all feeds is not
defined so we can see that that is
breaking successfully and we can see
that right when we put it back that that
test is working properly it detected
correctly that all feeds wasn't defined
it also says right that all feeds length
shouldn't be zero so if we go in and
have it to find but have nothing in it
we should see a bunch more failures and
we can see that right expected zero not
to be 0 then we can see that right
that's part of our RSS feeds are defined
testing suite so let's go back and fix
that and we can see cool that's sort of
being checked or that is being kept
correctly so when you're writing your
test it's good to kind of go through and
explore the apt j s code a little bit
and understand what the code is doing
you can also write you know explore the
actual app and use the developer tools
to look at these files but i like
looking at it and you know sublime text
just because it's really pretty same
thing with the HTML I mean there's going
to be a few tests that you have to do to
look at specific HTML elements and if
certain classes are defined so be sure
to go through the HTML and make sure
that you understand a little bit about
what the site is doing that way you can
properly test it right it does no good
to not either have a clear idea of what
you're implementing or have a clear idea
of what's implemented and then start
writing tests you need to start
somewhere and it's always good to kind
of understand the app that you've been
given before you be good writing tests
