we think back to the kindergarten
teacher example she does not start
counting her children starting with zero
she begins with one you can think of the
natural numbers as counting numbers and
when we count we usually begin with the
number one not 0 but 0 does have some
things in common with the natural
numbers we can talk about there being 0
of some kind of object like cupcakes
when considered as a single group 0 in
the natural numbers make up what we call
the whole numbers so let's go over the
two groups we have so far first we
talked about the natural numbers or the
counting numbers which are 1 2 3 and so
on all the way up to infinity so this
includes a ton of other numbers too like
89 560 and nine million 340 5760 as well
as every other number that we could
count from 1 up to infinity the whole
numbers include all of these numbers but
also zero so you can see that our sets
of numbers are starting to build on each
other which of the following sentences
accurately describe the relationship
between the natural and the whole
numbers please select as many as you
think are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
