learned a lot about many of the
different moving pieces that might go
into a machine learning analysis and I
think it's worth taking a step back and
explicitly talking about where you want
to use your training data and where you
want to be using your testing data
because this can be a little bit
confusing sometimes suppose that your
overall analysis flow looked something
like this you start out by splitting
your overall data into training and
testing sets then the next thing that
you want to do is apply PCA so a feature
transform and then you want to take a
few of your leading principal components
and put them into an SVM a
classification algorithm
remember that PCA itself can have a few
different commands that you might call
on it so you can call fit on your PCA
which actually finds the principal
components of your data but then you
also have to call PCA transform which
uses this fit that it's found to
actually transform the data into the new
principal components representation
likewise a support vector machine or a
support vector classifier can be fit on
some of the data and then be used to
make predictions on a different set of
data so let's suppose that coming out of
the training testing split we have two
different sets of features we're only
going to look at the features in this
quiz we have what's called training
features and test features the first
thing you want to do is apply principal
components specifically you want to find
the principal components using the fit
command do you want to apply the PCA dot
fit to the training features or to the
testing features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
