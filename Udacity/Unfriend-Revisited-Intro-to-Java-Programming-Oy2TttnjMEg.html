we didn't implement the unfriend method
when we refactored our code but now you
know how to remove items from an
ArrayList so let me see if I want to
remove a person non-friend
what if I try getting the name of
non-friend going through the list to
find its index and then removing that
index is there anything wrong with this
refactoring to save an ArrayList of the
friends names was a step in the right
direction but not enough if I have two
friends with the same name I wouldn't
know which one to remove in fact I can't
even tell if I have the same friend in
here twice right now I shouldn't just be
storing a list of the friends names
I should be storing a list of the person
objects associated with each friend
so let's refactor again I'll make my
ArrayList of string that I called
friends before into an ArrayList of
person now I'll have to fix the way I
initialize it in the constructor and
let's look at that implementation of the
getfriends method with the separator now
I need to actually get the name out of
the friend stored at this position I'll
show you what happens if I don't do that
whenever I try to print out the result
of get friends instead of printing the
person's name it's printing the class
and this weird jumble of symbols right
now the ArrayList to string method
doesn't know how to make a string
representation of a person so it just
prints the reference these symbols make
sense to the computer but not to people
so to avoid that mess in the getfriends
method I'll get the name from the friend
and add that and I'll do it in both
spots can you finish the rest of this
refactoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
