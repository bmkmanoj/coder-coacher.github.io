algorithm that kind of takes the idea of
random restarts one step further instead
of just waiting until you hit a local
optimum to decide that you're going to
randomly restart there's always a chance
of taking a step in a downward direction
while you're trying to do your help
climbing and the algorithm that we're
talking about in concretely is called
simulated annealing so the basic idea is
that we don't always improve sometimes
we actually need to search we need to
take the point where we are now and
wander away from it with the hope of
finding something even better and you
can think of this as being related to
the notion of exploring and exploiting
that hill climbing what it's doing is
always trying to exploit it's always
trying to climb its way up the hill as
quickly as it can which can lead it to
getting stuck exploring is the idea of
visiting more of the space with the hope
that you can actually climb even further
so which is better than exploring or
exploiting well you have to trade these
off really carefully so if you're just
exploring it means you're just randomly
wandering around the space you're not
using any of the local information to
improve yourself but if you only exploit
then you can get stuck in these local
Optima so you need to do a bit of both
so since I'm always trying to connect
this back to stuff we talked before if
you exploit all the time that's kind of
like overfitting but it's like believing
your data too much and not taking any
chances at all that makes sense is that
too much of a stretch it doesn't make
sense to me but I'm sure it makes sense
to you it makes sense to me so you want
to think of that as being kind of like
overfitting
well you know the fundamental problem of
overfitting right is believing your data
too much and dealing with just the
coincidences of what you happen to see
and that's like being very myopic and
exploiting in this case only taking the
direction which you go is like believing
the data point where you happen to be I
predict from this one example that I
should be headed in this direction and I
don't care about anything else and I'm
not going to worry about anything else
well that's kind of like believing too
much which is sort of what overfitting
is meanwhile search on the other hand
the exploring is like believing nothing
and taking advantage of nothing so
obviously you need to take as you said
take advantage of the local information
you need to believe it at least a little
bit at least some of the time or
otherwise it's as if you've learned
nothing
all right well I definitely agree with
you that there's a trade-off there and
that there's a resemblance to
overfitting I don't know how deep that
resemblances superficial they're like
they're like twin cousins twin cousins
from another family branch so the
simulated annealing algorithm that were
that we're talking about is related to
an algorithm called metropolis Hastings
which I always thought sounded really
cool and the whole idea of it actually
gets in to metallurgy so here I drew a
picture of a sword and we want the sword
when we making a sword for a blacksmith
we're making a sword we want it to be
nice and hard and the way to make it
hard and sharp and well-structured is
for all the molecules to be aligned in
the same way so they fit together very
snugly and they kind of lock in and so
there is a bit of an optimization
process that has to happen there's all
these different ways that the molecules
can be arranged and we would like to
settle into an arrangement that has the
lowest energy well it turns out that the
way that blacksmiths have figured out to
do this is they will make the sword and
then do repeated heating and cooling and
that actually show they can see that
that actually strengthens the blade and
and what's really happening at the
molecular level is it's giving the
molecules an opportunity to realign
themselves to find an even better
solution to the problem of how they can
all fit into that space
so this annealing is is this idea of
heating and cooling and we're not really
literally heating and cooling though of
course when we run the computer it is
getting a bit hotter we're just
simulating the idea of the temperature
changing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
