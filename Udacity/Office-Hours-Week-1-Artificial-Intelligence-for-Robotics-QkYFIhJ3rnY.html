seen a lot of really good discussion in
the forums and now we have professor
Thrun here with me I'm Andy the
moderator in the CS 373 form so we're
gonna divide the questions into the
course content questions and we're gonna
after that talk about some other
questions things that are specific to
Sebastian's work so first course content
questions a lot of people seem to have
questions about was when we're talking
about the sensing you introduced these
multipliers called P hit and PMS and you
assign values point six and point two so
people were confused about where those
numbers came from so this is something
that has put an ad hoc when I explained
it and later on they've become the
measurement probabilities but I didn't
want to start talking about
probabilities without programming them
first so P hit would be what's the
probability of say being next to a door
really seeing it and P miss will be the
probability of being next to nor not
seeing it this usually actually four of
those there's for measurement
combinations probability of seeing the
right measurement under their supplies
door and there's no door probably seeing
the wrong measurement on these two
assumptions but two of them a sufficient
for the math okay
and an early question about your work
how do you assign these so you said it
was done ad hoc in this in this little
example but in really designing a robot
car how do you decide on what these
values are going to be is it done
experimentally is it based on the
parameters of the sensors that's where a
lot of meat comes in and it certainly
meter didn't really cover in class and
do cover in my book it depends a lot on
the sensor so if I will use a camera use
a different model interviews a range
finder we use a lot of laser
rangefinders if we use laser laser
rangefinder they measure distances and
it's not P hit P miss anymore it's the
probability of measuring a certain
distance in a certain location the very
first approximation is physics you can
actually derive what the certificate
knows in the sensor and characterizes
but when you just use physics you often
have a very poor code on the actual
uncertainty so when tuning those
parameters you often do this very
experimental if you go in and and try
out certain parameters see which ones
works and then often soften them to me
to make them fit the math
okay so the next question a lot of
people had was is this is this method
we're using
does it depend on the robot already
having a map of its environment so
localization does depend on having a map
of environment so everything I taught so
far assumes there's a map there's an
entire field called simultaneous
localization and mapping or short slam
that addresses the more general problem
of acquiring a map at the same time and
I haven't covered this in class okay
all right those were two of the most
heavily voted course content questions
so in a real localizer I guess you sort
of address this but what are we looking
for when I'm looking for doors we're
looking for yes so in the Google
self-driving car which is a good example
we actually have a map of the groud that
is it's not that dissimilar from the way
Google Earth projects images on the
ground and then you can think of the
robot having a laser camera but a camera
that produces local maps and these local
maps have some of the same features like
lane markings as our global map and then
the probability match question is one
where you take the local map superimpose
on the global map and see where it
matches the best it's a search usually
in in x and y space is also a little
certain orientation space because you
might have your attention slightly wrong
the likelihood function that replaces
our P hit and P miss is then usually
your correlation function that says how
well does the local map that you see
right now match the global map and when
you shift into the right position the
matches will be much much better and as
a result you get a much larger
probability all right
and so some people were worrying about
whether changing road conditions were
there different weather lighting
conditions things like that would
greatly affect the feasibility of that's
a great question and we discusses it
every day turns out certain weather
conditions the car is relatively robust
right now rain for example changes the
total appearance of the street
and and you can adjust this with a
single constant factor that adjust the
total brightness of a laser map other
things like a complete snow-covered
Street we have no solution right now it
turns out so what we're doing right now
is we just don't drive in snow we live
in California there's not much snow here
and when there is snow we just tell the
driver let's use the system there's
something we have to work on I think as
we move into things like snow and some
very
of changes we have to reference to other
features maybe there's trees around or
other structures or rocks to release no
come to the mountain so maybe there's a
mountainous structure and we have to
test some of the information into the
system okay so there's been a people are
getting very excited in the forums they
they want to actually build their own
robotic car so some questions have been
how much is it gonna cost if I can't do
it because the cost is too high can I
get some Legos and build a ride a car
that way so there's a lot of kids who
can buy I love Lego Mindstorm which is a
wonderful way to experiment with these
things there's a lot of low cost Road
platforms you can buy I totally
recommend to heck into your car the
reason is the moment you start snipping
wires and your car might actually become
really unsafe so if you do work with a
car make sure you never ever drive this
car manually again all you know what
you're doing
we've actually been really tapping into
cars we've done things like decoding
understanding how you will use an
electric steering booster to turn this
into a steering motor arm so that the
car would be able to steer on computer
commands such as on human command but
it's a lot of work and it's actually
very risky so don't do it yourself
rather go and buy yourself a Lego
Mindstorms an examiner and play with it
you can actually study a lot of the same
stuff using a Lego kit if you make a
lego robot move from the kitchen to the
dividual that's actually really
impressive
okay I guess one last question is for
the before especially enthusiastic about
robotics and AI how do you get involved
in this field what can someone do after
taking this course so take this class as
you know we've been handing the CVS of
our top students onto various companies
like Amazon and Twitter and Facebook
Google that's one way to get involved
that doesn't work for everybody the way
I got involved is for van I had a lot of
toys with chicken program so I had a
computer I had little things to move
around there were that constructor set
in Germany which I could play with as a
kid and then I really started becoming a
scientist so I started publishing papers
I started solving problems at the
literature left open looking through
those receiver could make a contribution
at the age of or 22 I had my first big
big paper that was at a major conference
and that kind of started me to get into
the field and got me really hooked the
nice thing is I think there's there's
many many problems around you that
require the same technology there's
tracking problems estimation problems
all over the place right so if you can't
afford a robot why not just buy a web
camera and put it in your kitchen and
help it for example track whether your
cooking is good or bad but something
everybody can do with the same
technology like today most cooks
occasionally boil water over and then it
makes your stove wet can you build a
system the province's right that's a
robotic task twas the same technology
and if you do this and do this video
really well you might start a business
you might find other people to work with
you you might show the logo professor
and they kept excited about it they
might publish at a conference there's
many many ways into the system honestly
just be creative about it okay it sounds
like you're emphasizing you have to
think like a robot assistant that's I
think what this class is gonna help ya
so that's what I'm trying to do is make
people think like roboticist I'm
extremely excited that in this class you
get to a program with yourself
that's a a new thing when I was a
student I didn't have that possibility
in our previous class he couldn't do it
we are not at the point where you can
drive your own robot around yet and I
hope to get to this point where we have
a good robot simulator again you can
play with us but in we have enough stuff
you can just buy it most important your
cameras like camera phone you can do
localization of a hint headphone in a
room right using images and if you do a
really fantastic job you can start a
company and sell it to one of the major
players because it's an open problem to
the present day to do this really well
so there's a lot of technology available
today that allows you to think like a
reward system still solve the
interesting problems with this class I
hope all right well thank you very much
ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
