we know that the median was the 14th
value besides by simply counting is
there a way we can describe the median
value in symbols let's start first by
going over some symbolic notation that
we briefly mentioned earlier remember
that these are the rankings these are
not the actual data values but we can
denote the actual value in terms of its
rank so the value in the first rank
would be X sub 1 then X sub 2 for the
second rank X sub 3 for the third and in
the case of you dashians Facebook
friends X sub 14 is the median and
remember that any value we can
generically denote X sub i where X sub I
is the eighth value yes we do say ice so
what about for any data set with n
values the median will be different
depending on whether or not n is even or
odd
now this is going to be a really tricky
quiz which formulas describe the median
after sorting the data there's only one
answer for n even and one answer for n
odd now really quick this might look
daunting but just remember that this
subscript part corresponds to the rank
so for example say there are four values
in the data set n divided by 2 means 4
divided by 2 which is 2 so this would
mean X sub 2 which is the second value
might be the median if n is 4 I'm not
saying that's right I'm just giving you
an example so give this your best shot
and again this should really help get
you used to using symbols</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
