it's kind of fun let me make a couple of
picture objects if you look carefully
how I constructed the last object I
filled in the name of the file here and
I'll do it one more time like that if
you do it in this way you also have to
tell the program to draw the objects by
selecting the draw method the first
picture appears and the second picture
appears that looks kind of horrible
let's have a closer look on how we can
make this look nicer
first of all let's move the rocket a bit
and let's make the red planet a bit
smaller well that's much nicer but it's
a bit tedious to do this with your hands
and with clicking and clicking that's
where programming comes in here I've
written a program that does the same
actions that you've just seen me do by
clicking in a Java program a step at a
time will understand all of the details
pretty soon but let me show you the
basic lay of the land we're making a
picture out of the Mariner 4 image we're
translating it we're drawing it we're
making them another picture object we're
shrinking it and we're drawing it and
that composes the picture now when you
operate in this way you make an object
and then you later need to do something
to that object and it sits in a program
here it's not in the bluej workbench and
then it becomes very important to give
names to each of the pictures you'll
notice I call this one rocket I call
this one planet those names are names of
variables and that's what we want to
discuss next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
