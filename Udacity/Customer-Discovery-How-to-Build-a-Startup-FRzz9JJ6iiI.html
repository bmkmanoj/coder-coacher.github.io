customer discovery you're going to be
living this for the next couple of weeks
if you're doing this for real
phase one is you state your hypotheses
and you draw the business model canvas
and again you put the canvas on the wall
you and your team get around and put up
yellow stickies but the next step is you
get out of the building you're going to
test the problem you're going to test
your understanding of the customers
problem or need and you're going to
figure out how to build the prototype
the next thing is you're going to test
the solution you're going to test the
solution if you're on the web by
building a low fidelity and then a high
fidelity prototype and you're going to
again test your understanding of the
customers needs and whether your
solution matches it and this match again
it's called product market fit that's
the holy grail for entrepreneurs am i
building something that people can't get
enough of or just willing to open up
their wallets and empty it in front of
you to get their hands on and the fourth
phase in customer discovery is you
verify your pivot do people agree that
you're solving a high value problem or
need and you understand your business
model enough to start test selling which
is the next step in customer validation
now what's really depressing to most
entrepreneurs is the answer most often
the first time you go through this is
heck no you know it's been and what's
worse is well they kind of sort of like
what kind of sort of is not a startup
kind of sort of as people have been nice
to you the only time you know that you
have something that's worth investing
your time and money in is if people are
literally trying to force their money on
you or can't use your product even in
its buggy uninitialized form enough this
is what you're looking for and if you
haven't found it yet that's why the
customer development process is an
iterative circle it assumes you will be
going through this multiple times and
when you finally finally think you do
have something that matches customer
needs you get to the next step which is
customer validation let's take a look at
customer discovery one more time in just
a different way again if you're using
the startup owners manual you'll notice
these two tracks remember I said you
have one track
for physical one-track for web mobile
and all that is are the different
tactics for one channel versus another
but the strategy is the same state your
hypothesis test the problem test the
solution pivot and proceed and remember
all of this is going on outside the
building in front of customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
