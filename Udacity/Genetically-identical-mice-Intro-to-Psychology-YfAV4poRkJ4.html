psychologists involves modifying DNA
without changing the sequence molecular
tags known as methyl groups get attached
to the DNA and once tagged this can
signal for a gene to be turned off or
silenced regardless of the actual
sequence so this is an example in mice
that was done a while back and it
demonstrates the power of the
environment on your genes two
genetically identical strains of mice
from different mothers turned out
looking very different because their
respective mothers had very different
diets now one pregnant mother was fed a
diet rich in nutrients for things like
methyl groups the other mother was fed a
diet lacking nutrients for these methyl
groups the mother who had a diet rich in
nutrients for methyl groups gave rise to
offspring that were obese and had yellow
fur whereas the mother that had a diet
lacking these nutrients had normal
offspring that were non obese with brown
fur now the amazing thing about both of
these mice is that they're genetically
identical the mother who was fed one
diet rich in nutrients presumably was
able to regulate gene expression in a
certain way that gave obese mice with
yellow fur the other mother was fed a
different diet which alternatively
affected gene expression and resulted in
a brown furred non obese Mouse so
importantly these two mice are
genetically identical but they turned
out appearance-wise
very different we refer to these as
having the same genotype but a slightly
different epigenome and a very different
appearance or phenotype so although this
is yet to be shown in humans it
demonstrates that genes are not our
destiny their expression is influenced
by what we do and get exposed to from
our environment so let's go to this quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
