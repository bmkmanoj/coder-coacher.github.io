nanodegree ask the expert session my
name is Shania the lead program manager
at Google on the Android basics program
and we're so excited to have you here
today
we're really happy to be able to answer
your questions that you've sent in on
social media and the forums and so we're
happy to have Chris and Kathryn here
today now the Android basics nanodegree
program is a training program to help
aspiring developers learn the essentials
of Android development so we want to
make this a little bit easier for you to
categorize all of the questions and into
four categories prereqs curriculum after
graduation and just random q and A's so
let's welcome Kathryn and Chris how are
you guys doing today good introduce
yourself sure I'm Katherine Kuan a
developer advocate at Google and I'm
also the curriculum lead with Chris on
the Android basics nanodegree prior to
this I was a developer on the Android
apps team at Google and I've been a
developer an Android developer for about
six years now hi guys my name is Chris
Leigh I am a Content lead here at
Udacity particularly focused on our
Android based curriculum I've been
working with these good people here for
quite some time as well as the content
team here at Udacity working on the
Android developer nanodegree as well as
the Android basics nanodegree prior to
that yeah Udacity I was a software
engineer at Qualcomm working on a bunch
of Android devices which was pretty cool
and geez it's about eight years in the
industry right now so I don't know where
the time went but we're here so happy to
be here yeah and we're also excited to
have created the Android basics nano
degree
why did we you know start to create the
Android the basics and in a great
program Kevin I think it's like a couple
years ago and we just realized that
there was this huge market of people who
are interested in building Android apps
but they didn't have programming
experience or they didn't have Java
experience and so we created the Android
for beginners course that's sort of to
make it more accessible for anyone with
an idea to be able to build an app so
it's been two years and definitely super
rewarding after hearing like people's
stories and for sure yeah I mean the
biggest thing I think is just there's
been so many idea
about apps that have been tossed around
often deferred to those who are
technically inclined to implement them
and we just want to set the tone that
anyone that has an idea really can take
a step to make those ideas come to life
themselves and we like like catherine
alluded to we've been working for two
years to build a path to help you do
that so I think that leads us into our
first question from Jeff he has been
interested in learning how to program
for seven years but he hasn't started
yet
he's very little programming experience
love to tinker around with a different
absolute inventor and things like that
how would you help him get started with
Android development
we'll say I'd say Jeff yes get going on
into your development because this is
definitely an awesome I think
programming has had this historical
notion of being really hard to approach
largely because there are pieces of
ambiguity to basically overcome to to
make progress as a developer but as
Catherine mentioned earlier we've sat
down with our team and really worked
hard to help provide a path for you to
kind of go through those insights so
it's very common to feel a little
apprehensive initially but I think
you'll be really happy with the Korean
team that we put together to help you to
progress you can totally do it
yeah and in terms of the prerequisites
for the program you don't need any
programming experience and you only need
like basic computer skills so if you
know how to use like Microsoft Word or
like how to use a search engine and how
to use a smartphone that's basically all
you need to get started yeah and her she
asks before taking this course should he
actually take a job of course or he
should he Drive directly into Android
development I think you should
definitely just dive right into it
because the reason why we created its
curriculum with that you didn't have you
don't have to learn Java first and then
go into Android you can do Android and
Java at the same time awesome how long
does it take to complete the android
nanodegree john from san diego asks yeah
on average it takes it roughly about six
to nine months to complete the degree
now obviously that's gonna vary Chris
student depending on the amount of
I'm that you could you can dedicate
weekly we estimated about ten hours per
week so depending on how much time you
can put in anywhere between six to nine
months on average yeah and it definitely
can go by a lot faster if you have
programming experience or if you're
completely new and you just want to
review and go at a slower pace like it
can go longer so yeah Chris what are
some of the personality traits and
qualities that make great Android
development ooh that's a tough one it's
hard to say if there's actually a fixed
list you know but I think there's a
comic convergence around certain
characteristics that help developers
kind of succeed over time and grow as
developers I think one of them is kind
of an overwhelming passion for what
they're trying to solve as well as a
curiosity and a kind of embracing the
fact that the journey can be uncertain
at certain points and having a
willingness to learn new things to
overcome those challenges so I think the
final bit is really about being being
determined you know with your passion
but to have a sense of grit to really
push through the challenges that might
arise and I think yeah just just really
being focused and and dedicated to the
cause that you're trying to solve I
think is there's a really good step yeah
I really like how you mentioned the
great aspect because a lot of developers
like when you get a new task or new
project you might not know where to
start and it doesn't even happen for
experienced developers but the fact they
persist and try to figure out like what
do you know what are your questions get
those answers like you move past it and
I think that's what I develop a seasoned
developer being a little fearless in the
in the awkward situations like pushing
forward pedra asks I need help
determining which android nanodegree to
take I have some experience in Android
and in Java but when I take the
intermediate courses for the Android
developers I need it looks like
complicated captain you like and tell us
about that sure so we created with
Udacity and end
Android training curriculum so the
Android basics mandatory is for someone
with zero or like one-year programming
incidence and it covers everything from
java computer science and fundamentals
as well as android basics and then that
leads into the Android developer nano
degree which helps prepare people for a
job an entry-level job in Android
development and that covers more
advanced topics like performance or
Google Play services build form factors
yeah build systems which is on cue
design yeah yeah like building for
watches to the living room things like
that so that's kind of the two places
that you can start either Android basic
nanodegree or the intermediate Android
anything yeah man I think and just add
to that I think in general is very
comfortable with object or any
abstractions you feel very fluent with
system concepts like parallelism or even
the using basic data structures like
arrays array lists lists you might want
to try jumping into Android developer
immediately you probably do have some
technical background to get you off the
ground going quickly there however it
never hurts to slow down a little bit
and you know you can always take some
time to go into the Android basics
content will focus on specific areas of
the platform and low it and learn it a
bit more slower pace but as you build
momentum and if you feel like you're
starting to recall some of the concepts
that you may have learned before you can
always hop back into the Android
developer content as well again the
essentials down at the basics level Java
parallelism networking basic data
structures even just have a plan an app
how to approach your design in stages
and then when you're ready you feel
capable to go really deep with the
platform that's what I think you can
really flourish in the Android developer
nanodegree one you can explore not only
the fundamentals but just really cool
specific rich experiences on Android
whether it be you know phone tablet
watch TV and and at that point you're
really just trying to focus on making
your app seeing can be awesome for users
so
so Chris how much this banana tree costs
oh so then an agree is a premium product
and it costs $1.99 per month with you
and US dollars just be clear and with
that experience you get some distinct
support for your learning journey
particularly in the form of active forms
that have leaders that have been
experienced in the topic areas and are
ready to answer your questions I think
again one of those big things about
learning something new is that your
navel e gonna run into some areas of
ambiguity and have some questions so
these channels whether or not being able
to post to a forum and get a response
soon is really critical for your
progress in addition you can set up
one-on-ones but I think the the real
special sauce in the nanodegree is being
able to get live code feedback on the
projects that you submit so as you're
working toward your nano degree you see
you can submit your project at any time
and it'll go to our network of really
qualified reviewers to kind of give you
real feedback inline line of my lining
of code so you can really get some
really good insights as you progress
yeah I think when I was learning Android
development the code reviews from the
other engineers who were more senior
than me like really good me because
you're at that detailed level where you
you correct your understanding and
improve as a developer same I have to
say as well yeah and Jetta Bay asks will
there be a discount coupon or some
financial incentive for the course now
with all of the premium services that
you guys are offering they're absolutely
fantastic but we definitely don't want
that to hinder anyone to start their
Android development journey so we also
offer the courses and instruction for
free if you visit udacity.com/google
you'll see about 35 and growing courses
there that the content is available for
free and then you get premium services
on top of that so you can definitely get
started today at any time and then
continue with your journey with coaches
and mentorship and all of those
different things
for sure and now I want to get into kind
of the course overview because there's a
lot in all of the courses right there's
there's a ton of notes but there's also
a really great instruction we do a
really really good job of explaining
providing examples captain do you want
to kind of give us an overview of the
courses that you created sure so we have
four courses in the Android basics nano
degree the first one Android for
beginner starts for the very beginning
and it talks about layouts how do you
lay things out on your screen and you
make a birthday card act in the process
to give to a loved one and then from
there we move into making an app that's
interactive so we build up a coffee
ordering app where you can put
information and sends off your order in
an email and so you learned about how to
make an app interactive also learn about
like object oriented programming
concepts for the first time and then in
the next course Android basics multi
screen apps we learn about how to make
an app that has multiple screens and
show a list of data and we do that by
creating an app for the Miwok Native
American tribe it's a language app so it
lists a bunch of vocab words and if you
click on them it also plays audio for
them which is really cool the next
course the Android basics networking
course and that one you learn how to
fetch data from the internet and display
it on your device and so we create an
earthquake app that shows the top most
recent earthquakes in the world and we
fetch it from the USGS
site that's right the last course is
Android basics data storage course and
that one talks about how to store data
on your device so if you leave your app
and come back and your data still going
to be there and we build a pet shelter
app where we keep track of a list of
pets and that's basically banana debris
yeah yeah
so Patrick asks do this program do you
get a good foundation in Java Chris what
do you think you know that's a good
question
because we've had to you know I think
that the basic answer is we teach you
this essential Java that you need for
doing really good Android development
you know as far as going deep with
deeper features with regards to the
language those are something that you
could probably pursue on the side in
other courses however we'll be using and
teaching Java particularly on how to how
to use it well in the framework
obviously different features of language
we use differently so you could you
could apply some of those skills to
other platforms but then we'll also have
to cover the gaps in however those other
platforms design as well so a good
foundations again but particularly
tailored to to Android development
great now roman asks a very typical
question which is actually a really
really good question that I really had
answered and he asks I've taken a few
Android for beginners courses here and
there and one thing that they've all had
in common is you just jump right in and
just start showing you how to build one
certain thing but after those courses
when you're trying to build something in
your own you actually get really stuck
and you get a little confused so will
this course concentrate more on the step
by step learning and the theory behind
those things or will it give you a firm
and complete knowledge of Android
development Katherine how do you like
that yeah there was a balanced
curriculum between wanting to teach them
found that from the ground up so they
wouldn't become this superstar developer
versus just throwing them into it and
just like building really cool things
and I think we chose the latter option
because we wanted them to get excited
about Android development we wanted them
to have quick wins to show have apps to
show their family and friends and to
maybe decide to study computer science
more in-depth afterwards so by choosing
this approach we can't go through like
tons of examples for every concept about
variables and data types but we do hope
that it provides a really good context
of when you would actually use these
concepts instead of like theoretically
going concept after concept about about
abstract scenarios yeah I think I key
thing that we tried to focus on was
making really useful examples so each
thing that we focus on is really
practically applied to Android
development you know traditionally I
think you learn concepts and computer
science and layers but
I think a lot of you just really
interested in getting building quickly
so we've done our best to create a path
through that is meaningful and along the
way you focus directly on the Android
development but also pick up some Java
some CS along the way and some other
useful things that'll help you grow as
developer so yeah and Preeti asks let's
know about JSON and Android to me to
talk about that too so you're asking
about JSON a lot of technology today in
computing revolves around requesting
data from the internet now when you do
that online and on the internet data
comes back in and these structured
formats so they can be easily extracted
for various use cases in the case for
example for a mobile app so JSON is
simply one of those formats on how to
structure data it uses this key value
semantics and if you're interested to
learn more about that that's that's in
our third course Android basics
networking let you go you'll see me as
some more so and we'll dive into detail
and basically what that structure is
getting form using some tools to get a
little bit more familiar with it and
then eventually writing code to work
with it in your apps and there is that
exercise where you read information from
the Twitter API that's right so you'll
see JSON in action and a lot of really
useful scenarios and probably in some of
the ways that you're used to hearing
about for example like data that you get
back for from Twitter is used is in the
form of JSON as well as a bunch of other
popular services like Facebook and and a
myriad of other API so this question
comes from Deepak I see a lot of
emphasis on the REST API and other
technologies and frameworks that he
doesn't know it would be really great if
the panel could explain how does
learning Android development how long it
will take in terms of product app
development work and where exactly
arrests api's would help in that
development process start off well a
Deepak kudos for getting REST API is
down that's a pretty technical term in
its own right I think the general thing
that you're kind of converging on these
days is that there's a lot of really
interesting data and functionality
across the Internet these days
especially with mobile and the fact that
we live in a pervasive Buddhist
environment now so a lot of application
experiences are inherently reliance on
things that are not local to the device
so in the third course of the Android
basics nano degree we're gonna be
focusing on how to interact with a web
api so you'll learn how to read the
documentation from a bunch of different
services but more than anything
understand the process on how to request
information across the internet and then
extract it into your app so really
really useful skill set and you'll
probably find yourself doing it in a lot
of app scenarios so yeah look forward to
seeing us in the third course Android
basics networking awesome and here's one
more curriculum question I'm sure it'd
be neat he says how should I begin when
I need user input data to be calculated
to store it and to be displayed in
different ways to the user they read a
little bit about the SQLite method but
couldn't get the code kick-started
captain how you feel about that yeah so
it can be overwhelming to figure out
where to get started in terms of getting
user data from the app you can
definitely check out the just Java app
in the first course where we build up a
coffee ordering app and that can get you
set up with the UI aspect of it and in
terms of storing data you can check out
our Android basics data storage course
we talk about sequel Lite and how to
store data in a database and how to
display that back in your app yeah and
of course is gonna be pretty great
especially just understanding the
different data scenarios that you run
into an app you'll learn about lots of
things actually across the whole degree
per se but particularly zero in on it
when there's lots of metadata again like
Katherine said focusing on how to use
and integrate a database to store all
that information so so what we learn
about the Android operating systems
architecture how about porting is is
there a different course that we're
gonna teach to teach it yeah that's a
good question it generally is a favorite
subject of mine but there's a lot of
software layers that go into making the
Android operating system some of which
are very closely tied to the hardware
a little bit out of scope I think for
app development per se but I think we
will definitely focus on helping you
build the healthy mindset on how to work
with the framework to use some of the
functionality that you're probably used
to thinking about when you're when
you're in the context of mobile devices
for example we'll teach you how to use
the right classes to open a network
connection and retreat data from it via
the same methodology at least using Java
you can use the framework to access
other key pieces of functionality on a
device like displaying views through
screen playing sound back even accessing
key sensors on the on the device like
the gyroscope or the accelerometer for
example so again it's really about the
right mindset on how to use the
framework to help you do what you want
in the app and let letting the rest of
the lower layers assist in making that
come to life so you also asked about
porting again porting is largely
dependent on the hardware and how
Android would sit on top of various
piece of hardware that's largely a
different perspective on development so
we won't be covering that in this
Android platform and also has
documentation articles on that - yeah
for sure there's there's just one of the
cool things about Android is the fact
that the whole stack is open source so
you can go and you can you can read code
and all different pieces of it if you'd
like so definitely check that if you're
interested in I think the end-to-end
stack awesome I'd like to get into after
they graduate because that's always a
really big question like I'm taking this
degree but what do I get to do after and
such and asks well how realistic is the
expectation that someone with a
rudimentary understanding of programming
can go on and create useful Android
applications after the standard degree
Catherine so after the first lesson of
the course they basically
we install Android studio the
professional tool that Android
developers use and then they build an
app right away and it keeps going like
we build projects with them and they
also have projects on their own so they
just get it locked that you get a lot of
exposure to building different apps and
so in in those projects we hope that
they kind of go off on their own and
explore and kind of like learn on their
own to kind of take the training wheels
off like we're not always gonna be there
holding their hand and and helping them
when they get stuck so we also try to
teach them like how how to learn in a
way we go over like how to read
documentation and if there's all these
things that are really overwhelming to
you how do you pick out the pieces that
you do understand or if your app is
crashing like how do you go into the
debugger and track and and look at what
exactly happening in your code so we
kind of try to do the best we can to
prepare them for the real world yeah for
all types of apps and areas I think we
we definitely I think someone that
finishes Android basics will be prepared
to build very basic functionality in a
lot of different areas
depending on the app idea but you know
like like Katherine said what we try to
set up the student with the right
mindset to pursue things that might not
be included in the courses so again you
get a lot of breadth about just the
basics of the fundamentals on building
for Android you might get some
experience doing some networking if
you're going to how to store data but
there might be some additional
functionality that you might need for
your app and you can use some of the
skills that you learn in the other
courses to pursue those functionalities
pieces of functionality as well yeah and
what I also really like that we've done
is we've also set the student up for
after graduation like real job scenarios
like how to work with the team how to
read a code bases matter fairly your own
because you're not always going to be
creating an app from scratch and
and how to think about bigger problems
where you're just adding a single
feature and how does that fit in with
the entire app altogether I really like
that aspect of the program yeah and they
do some design too in figuring out how
to work with the designer for those that
are really passionate about product
manager or anything like that exactly
real world scenarios team environments
basically and so I Curtis wants to ask
he's recently graduated from the Android
basics nanodegree program and he wants
to know we would be adding any more
scholarships now scholarships are if you
were one of the first 100 people to
finish the Android basics and agree you
basically got a scholarship to the
Android developer nano degree and
unfortunately we don't have any more yet
but stay tuned and stay develop Bank as
it's definitely really worth it to be
able to continue to develop your Android
Korean keep building apps and stay in
contact with us as well we definitely
can help you on you know forums and you
know on social and things like that yeah
and I know I definitely speak for
Udacity here that we've it's been an
overwhelming tremendous and worth
response to the leaderboard and the
scholarship opportunities and just
really thrilled to see so many students
engaged so stick with us and we'll go
from here
so Hobby asks there are a lot of things
written about getting jobs with you dad
because that's you know one of the main
purposes of this program but it's all
based in the US his question is what
kind of support will help landing a job
if he's out of the US yeah so this is a
bit we have a new initiative here with
our careers team we just launched a new
site called the careers Resource Center
which focuses largely on tips and advice
for basically preparing for the job
search connecting with employers a lot
of that information is relatively
country agnostic but we do have a site
link that will link with this talk that
has tips specifically for folks in in
other countries outside of the US I
think there's a lot of scenarios that
are definitely different and varying per
region but again we're
trying to help prepare all of you
because our mission here is to
democratize education to make that
available to anyone around the world
regardless of their their situation in
context so yeah and speaking of new
programs we're really excited to talk
about this as well Olympia asks upon the
completion of the nanodegree would you
recommend applying for the associate
Android developer certification and
we're also really excited about this
because this is also something new that
we've launched recently in 2016 to
actually certify Android developers from
Google now the Android basics manager II
doesn't cover enough to be able to you
know work on that certification but it
definitely provides a great start I
think the core essentials for that
certificate come from the developing
Android apps free course so for folks
that you know where that's an ideal spot
to jump in I definitely encourage you to
check that course out as well yeah now
here's a question we get all the time
from Israel does this program prepare
you to actually have a solid enough
foundation to be an engineer at Google
I'll defer to Kathryn having gone
through the engineering engineering
interview process at Google I'd say it's
definitely really challenging they do
ask a lot of data structure and
algorithm questions and this was one of
the things we struggled with and
figuring out the trade-off when we were
developing our curriculum like do we
prepare people to be a software
developer a general software developer
or do we prepare them to be an Android
developer and unfortunately you've heard
about in the tech industry like the
interview process is kind of broken
where we're testing people on skills
that they don't necessarily use we do
work especially in Android development
you don't really need algorithm
knowledge unless you're doing something
very specific which may be like a very
special image processing app or
something like that so I guess the short
answer is like this is meant this
nanodegree is meant to get you
interested in computer science and
developing apps and you can like build
up a portfolio and maybe
like show that to employers who look at
who value work experience and will ask
you very specific Android questions and
then from there maybe then later on
apply to like a bigger tech company then
there's a difference between building
Android apps and then developing the
core framework of Android the actual
hardware and the software to run actual
Android rather than absent yeah there's
there's we'll talk about this later but
there's many layers of open-source
technologies and software that go into
comprising the whole Android stack which
largely is a big set of knowledge but I
want to encourage students that there's
so many opportunities these days even
outside of tech that are just relying or
just benefiting from the creation of
mobile apps so even beyond Google
there's small businesses really cool
causes around the world that can really
benefit from app development and I think
there's just a huge opportunity that
folks don't always realize that they can
have impacts in their communities and
different businesses just by doing a
little app development so again like
Kathryn said we had to kind of make a
choice as to how we can enable people
the best and I think there's just so
many more opportunities right now and
creative ones at least in the app that
the app world and that's what we focused
on it is again building experiences for
all the types of Android devices that
exist out there yeah now Nayeem asks I'm
a beginner in Android about development
and what are the things that I need to
keep in mind while developing my Android
app to make my app successful pattern I
think the first thing to make sure of is
that you're actually solving a real user
need because it's once you have these
skills it's easy to create things from
it but I think the hard part is to
empathize with your user and really make
sure that you have a user experience
that is helping the user solve the
problem beyond that in terms of like the
implementation like there's the core app
quality checklist
Android development documentation site
which lists things that you can check
specifically in your apps like behavior
to make sure that you're conforming to
the standards of what other Android apps
are like on the device there's more than
one right on the device at the same time
yeah you just want to be consistent with
the other apps on the device but as well
also like distinguish your app as well
there's also the material design
guidelines that the Google design team
came up with a couple years ago and so
it's this really beautiful spec that has
like instructions and guidance on how to
do everything from layout to like motion
typography typography imagery everything
resource to check out awesome now I'd
like to get into just regular Q&amp;amp;A all
right his or her name is August Khan and
I hope I said that right
but Android studio is always releasing
new versions of it and it becomes
difficult when and different from the
different tutorials when we're teaching
it as a beginner they get you know they
get how do we adapt those tutorials to
help with new versions of Android yeah
obviously there's a there's a lot of
development and changes that happen
along a long time with the toolset I
think this is a common piece of feedback
that we've received from students that
they see changes how come our courses
aren't updated I think we definitely
understand and hear this so while we may
record our content with a particular
version we do plan to provide
supplementary material for any changes
that happen so for example with the
newly released constraint layout that
was introduced to Android studio 2.2 or
later I believe I could be wrong there
but we're gonna will be will be
augmenting the existing content with
guides and examples on how you can adapt
your current templates that we have
recorded with to use the new
functionality in the studio so we plan
to update a lot more incrementally so
stay tuned for that
we've always got your back with new
updates because they have
so fast all the time
Vivek asks how do you write test cases
to test Android good question
we actually don't cover it
in much depth in our Android basics and
degree or in the more intermediate
nanodegrees yeah it's yes but you can
write unit tests like you would for any
java application that's not Android
specific to just test like specific Java
functionality you can also write
expresso tests for for testing the UI of
your app you know testing that certain
activities pop up for certain buttons to
certain things not having to do it
yourself you can programmatically test
it yeah automated and then in the latest
version of Android studio isn't there
the automated test recorder there is so
you can like like manually do it like do
the steps on your phone and then it will
record it and then turn that into auto
generated code for you to create the
test yeah yeah it's pretty awesome so
yeah the tools are just getting better
and better and I think that just it's
really exciting as a developer for sure
um Mohammed he would like to get a
little bit more enlightenment on github
and should he take version control a
version control course in order to work
with the intro basics manager Wow
mohabbat that's a good question for
Android basics as degree we don't have a
requirement for github skills per se
although I think as you'll see as your
career progresses as a developer just
having basic source control skills is
kind of critical for your growth and
particularly when you're working with
multiple team members that are
contributing to code code at the same
time so when you're when you're learning
with Android basics don't feel like you
need to take any specific get courses
but as you build up some experience
you're welcome to take some side course
we have one at Udacity and that'll help
you protect prepare as you go forward we
also put all the code for our course on
github
people can browse through the solution
code yeah I think there's that there's
really cool tools available on that site
where you can compare code and we we
make our changes and commit so you can
easily see small Delta's yeah as we
teach things so plenty of graphical
tools at least to start with so you
should be at home
Ryan B asks is it possible to monetize
apps in the Android ecosystem this is he
has friends who have completed blue cams
in iOS and they're always talking about
the ability to make money with their
apps and and yes we don't actually cover
in Android basics as this is mostly the
technical requirements and building the
applications but as far as monetizing
and marketing the axis what do you do
after you build them right we do have
the tech entrepreneurship classes that
do include monetization and all of the
new fresh ways to add ads and it now
purchases and all of the great things
that you can do to actually make money
once you're done building your apps and
Darnell from Indonesia asks he there are
events for Android from either Google
and Udacity but they're all in the
United States what do we do about events
outside of the United States
particularly in Indonesia and actually I
think I can take this one we have we're
continuing to build events all over the
world we'd love to be able to connect
with developers and talk to them and
make sure that their questions get
answered alternatively we have a site
called Google developer groups I mean
you can actually just go online it's a
developers.google.com and you can click
on events and search on your country and
find events I definitely know that there
are some in Indonesia and so definitely
check it out we'd love to have a chance
to talk to you in person beyond our data
shows here at Udacity that especially
when you you combine your online
learning with in-person learning you're
you're that much more likely to continue
and matriculate through the program so
it's just a really cool way to meet
other developers at the same time I hear
about their ideas and their stories in
addition to helping you
continue your learning and getting
feedback on on what you're working on
awesome last question
SCI asks to be good at Android you need
a lot of practice which is very very
good where do you suggest is the best
place to begin building the practice for
Android apps what well I mean I think
first and foremost you're gonna you're
gonna be building a lot with your
project your anything that you're in the
degree there are 10 projects roughly
spaced around 2 weeks apart from each
other so as you work on those you'll get
a lot of feedback from our code
reviewers but I think there's a lot of
opportunities even in your day-to-day
lives whether it be open source code or
even small businesses in your area that
you could think you can help contribute
to their their their missions by
building that for them I think yeah and
you know find someone that you can work
with or learn together with or find
someone who's more experienced in
Android development we can mentor you
and just start practicing and building
like you could build an app for yourself
but even more useful is to find someone
who needs an app and then build it for
them so you're practicing like having a
customer and I think actually when you
put when you're ready and you put your
app on Google Play I think that's when
you really start learning because you
build up your user base and then you're
accountable to them now you have to fix
bugs like you know you need to address
their feature requests but it's a good
thing you know to have users who are
excited about your app and to want to
you know give them more and who really
care about the value that you're trying
to provide yeah so that really makes a
big impact on their day to day lives so
yeah yeah I mean maybe one more thing
actually another think about it is check
out developer conferences I mean Google
has one every year there's lots of great
video sessions it's a great place to
also meet other fellow developers as
well so and live viewing parties if you
can't make it to mountain in your area
there they do viewing parties in almost
every country at this point though you
can get together with your friends and
view all the sessions in talk about it
and definitely use the technology to
build one
better Internet's so thank you so much
it's been so fun mmm more questions
about the Android basically a degree
program feel free to check us out on
social or email us or tweet us but also
check out us support at Udacity calm and
we've had so much fun having you today
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
