support groups group therapy is a
therapeutic setting in which several
people who share a common problem all
meet regularly with a therapist to help
themselves and to help each other these
groups tend to be very structured some
group therapies for example offered
training and learning to overcome social
anxiety disorder and others may use
cognitive behavioral therapy to treat
eating disorders now there are other
groups that are less structured in the
therapeutic context and these are
support groups these are meetings of
people who share a common situation
whether it's a disorder disease or even
coping with an ill family member support
groups are widely available and can be
categorized in terms of their focus for
example their support groups for eating
disorders substance abuse the treatment
of OCD even coping with the loss of a
loved one Alcoholics Anonymous and other
substance abuse groups are considered
support groups and these are available
