possible to construct a fair voting
system the way that you can think about
this in very simple mathematical terms
it that I know that I think you'll like
Michael is that all of these things
assume that everyone is using exactly
the same units right but if one of the
agents is using the metric system and
someone else is using the imperial
system it turns out you can't even
compare the two there's absolutely no
reason to believe that the values that
each of these individual agents are
developing follow the same linear notion
of ordering of Q values and if that's
not the case then all of these things
are basically going to break because all
of them boil down to doing what looks
like some kind of addition or averaging
or maxing or maxing but maxing is just
kind of a weighted averaging right kind
of an exponential averaging and so you
end up with a max that way same thing
with negotiated W learning you're
subtracting things and taking mins in
the end you're basically assuming that I
can compare your seven with my seven and
it means the same thing right why would
your seven in my seven mean the same
thing so all of these have that kind of
problem and in fact there's a paper that
written by a student of mine that is a
part of the readings that delve into
this in more detail and we could spend a
lot of time on it but actually the idea
is very simple which is really that once
you start thinking about goals and you
think about these individual modules or
individual options as trying to
accomplish different things you have to
deal with the fact that their goals may
not be completely compatible with one
another and you have to come up with
some way of making them compatible and
you can either assume that compatibility
by just pretending you're seven and my
seven are the same or you can say well
there's some larger goal you're trying
to accomplish that the arbitrator knows
about the arbitrator is going to make
decisions based upon whether it
accomplishes that big goal in the
predator-prey case for example the big
goal might be living long enough to
reproduce and so I'm gonna pick the sub
goals that allow me to live long enough
to reproduce
I see I think so so there's a high-level
goal and then these sub goals that are
and to try to bring about the high-level
goal right and so it's the arbitrator
that has to decide what's going on so
this is this is this seems like a kind
of straightforward thing but I actually
think it's kind of cool right that
basically we went from actions to
abstract actions these options those
abstract actions actually turn out to be
or at least one can look at it this way
ways of accomplishing goals once you
have these ways of accomplishing goals
then suddenly you realize well these
goals don't necessarily have to be
compatible with one another and so I
have to deal with that compatibility and
so you've moved from an MDP with
primitive actions to this larger notion
of balancing trade-offs as you're trying
to accomplish some large goal for the
entire system and in the end there's
still all MDPs because they're smtps and
F's and DPS are MTPs and in the end all
of that reinforcement learning stuff
that we've been talking about throughout
the entire term still applies and you've
kind of brought together generalization
with multi-agent the you know type of
thinking yeah so we got multi agents we
got single agents we got multiple goals
we got conflicting goals we've got
abstraction and this gives us scale and
everything's wonderful
