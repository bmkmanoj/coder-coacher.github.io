gives us the first benefit it gives us
is that it reduces the overall number of
instructions we have to execute we
started out with this code and the
overall number of instructions that we
execute in a thousand iterations that we
have of this loop and the number of
instructions that we had to execute in
this loop was five instructions in each
iteration times 1,000 iterations of the
loop for a total of five thousand
instructions to do this loop now we
unroll this loop once and got this now
the number of instructions is eight
times in each iteration of this loop we
are doing the work of two iterations and
we are moving the pointer by two places
so we will only have 500 iterations as
opposed to 1,000 here which gives us
only four thousand instructions to do
the loop instead of five thousand so we
have dramatically reduced the number of
instructions it takes to do the loop and
we did it by eliminating what's called
the looping overhead basically this is
the work of the iteration and this is
the looping overhead to go to the next
iteration when we do two iterations at a
time we do twice the work but the
overhead only applies to one of the new
iterations so we get half the overhead
per original iteration remember the iron
law where the execution time is the
number of instructions times the CPI
times the cycle time of the processor
the cycle time will not change we still
have the same processor the CPI may or
may not change but definitely we have
reduced the number of instructions so we
can see that loop unrolling just by
eliminating the looping overhead can
reduce the execution time but let's look
what happens to the CPI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
