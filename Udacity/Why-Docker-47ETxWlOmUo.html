modern application design I'm pretty
sure our next step is to deploy our code
now I'm thinking about application
dependencies I'm thinking about how to
build packets and distribute all of
these applications and this seems like a
lot of work kelsey is there any way
around this one option what did we
figure out all your dependencies and
build a native package for every Linux
distro you plan to support or you can
skip all of that and build a container
image
what's the container image a container
image is a packaging format that
includes not only your application but
all your dependencies and runtime
information required to run it think
about your mobile phone you download a
self-contained application and run it
contains do the same thing but for your
servers
oh so this is something that's available
in service today close the container
technology is built into most major
operating systems including Linux and
Windows but it's not exactly easy to use
out of the box you'll need something
like docker which provides a nice API on
top of container technology and makes it
easy to create distribute and run
container images on your own servers ok
I get it you know given the available
options and my sanity it seems like it's
hangar images are the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
