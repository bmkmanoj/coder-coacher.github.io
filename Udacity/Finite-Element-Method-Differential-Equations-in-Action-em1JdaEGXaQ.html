the finite element method Fe M these
days it's the workhorse of almost all
mechanical engineers Fe M can answer for
instance what happens when you put a
huge truck on the bridge to compute this
deformation is an application of Fe M to
the static case but if the M can also be
applied in a dynamic setting for
instance to simulate the effect of a
crash on a car body here it's important
to look at the process of buckling
whereas in the static case we are not
really interested in how the truck was
placed on the bridge it just has to be
there I want to outline three
fundamental ideas of the finite element
method
the first is discretization the
continuous structures are approximated
with the help of guess what finite
elements element of finite size not
infinitesimal size when we do so the
first question is which geometry these
finite elements should have should they
be tetrahedra should they be cubes or
should they even be curvy linear the
second fundamental idea is that of
interpolation given the finite elements
how do i compute a value at an arbitrary
location and for the static case a
really fundamental idea instead of
minimization of the potential energy
think about a ball that rolls on a
terrain of mountains and valleys
eventually it's going to come to rest in
a valley in the static case potential
energy is minimized let's have a closer
look at that Valley in a Gedanken
experiment let's place this object a
little further to the left or a little
further to the right then the energy
stays almost the same because we're at
the bottom of the valley which means
that to displace this object in this way
requires no work this is the concept of
virtual work for all infinitesimal
displacements that are allowed we can't
go down and we can't go up obviously
the virtual work
equals zero in mathematics this way of
posing the problem with the help of
virtual work is called a weak form the
strong form would be to ask for all
forces to compensate the weak form asks
for the virtual work to be equal to 0
for all allowed virtual displacements
this weak form results in a finite
number of equations that we can solve on
the computer let's find that number
however may range in the hundred
thousands or even millions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
