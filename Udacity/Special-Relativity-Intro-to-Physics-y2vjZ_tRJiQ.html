amazing subject for me when I took
special relativity this was the first
time that I encountered something that
was completely unintended reform special
relativity are going to be things we
never see in our daily lives and that's
because special relativity deals with
the realms of the very very fast of
objects moving near the speed of light
the speed of light is such an important
number in physics that we give it its
own variable we call it lowercase C and
its value is about three times ten to
the eighth meters per second in fact the
exact value is 299,792,458 meters per
second but this is the approximation
we're going to be using in this unit all
right so I've told you how crazy and
mind-blowing this topic is going to be
where do we begin such a topic who do we
start with what we talked about well
let's start with our good friend Galileo
now you may have heard that special
relativity is Einstein's theory Albert
Einstein and yes that's true but just
like noon before him I enstein stood on
the shoulders of Galileo to make his or
at least one of his amazing discoveries
in fact his theory of special relativity
can be completely derived by two
postulates a postulate or axiom is just
something that we believe to be true and
which we use we use these postulates by
applying logic to them and eventually we
get some conclusions what's pretty
amazing about this approach to problems
is that as long as the logic is sound
you can't argue the conclusions if you
believe the postulates what I'm going to
do today you show you what these two
postulates are motivate why they must be
true then we'll see a couple of the
remarkable conclusions that fall out
let's move forward to the first
postulate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
