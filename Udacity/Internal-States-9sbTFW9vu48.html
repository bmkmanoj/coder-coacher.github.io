however it is occasionally necessary
even when modeling externally visible
behavior of a device to invent some
additional internal states the most
common example or timers such as what we
saw earlier a user can't really
understand how a clock radio works
without appreciating that there are
several internal timers working see if
you can come up with a list of what
internal timers are there okay what
timers do you have so the first one of
is the snooze timer so as soon as you
hit the snooze button and in 10 minutes
the x times up to 10 minutes short what
else there is an alarm time I think or
you know you the alarms not going to go
on forever so you know there's like an
internal in their state for our alarm
has started and then at some point the
alarm needs to go off so it's not
playing forever so recall the original
requirements in which we said that the
alarm can only go for an hour and so
there has to be a timer to time up to
that one hour what else for the sleep or
internally when you are playing music
and you have your sleep timer set does
that is there something that kicks off
that usually I you press sleep on right
so or something like that and then it'll
it'll run until you it meets the time
you've set for one the well if you've
set the sleep timer then when you move
your slide switch our mode switch into
radio or alarm I guess into radio it's
going to normally if you have them set
this the time it would go off you
wouldn't wouldn't be hearing any radio
so if you're sitting there and you moved
on the radio comes on okay but if you
move it to radio music music music okay
it would normally go off but you have
the sleep timer set it goes off after
that amount time and then another
internal timer is for your salute your
sleep timer I guess I want to make sure
i understand correctly how the sleep
timer like how it functionally works so
you press the sleep time and that's like
so you want to play for 30 minutes
before it goes off so to activate that
you what mode do you need to be in like
attack start your sleep timer okay so
there's two things going on here setting
the amount of time before the radio goes
off and and then actually causing that
that to happen at night when you're
ready to go go to sleep so we know how
to set the time by hitting the sleep
button and then setting some time there
now it turns out on this particular
clock radio we've seen that the
possibilities are 12 hours and there's
60 minutes but this particular clock
radio you can only set it I believe for
up to up to an hour okay so you're
really just setting the minutes of
minutes part of it and I haven't
personally tried this feature out so I
don't know what the internal logic does
in the situation where you say three
hours and 20 minutes even though it's
only can do this sleeping for an hour so
that's that's one thing that as a an
actual developer we'd have to decide
upon then there's the question of how
when you're going to the bed at night
this thing works and what it what it is
is if you have set the sleep time if
it's got a an actual value you've put in
there when you move the the mode switch
into radio you would normally expect not
to hear anything but if you've got the
sleep time set then you would actually
expect the radio to continue playing
until that sleep time expires okay so
then I guess just the eternal internal
timer for that so as soon as you move it
into that mode it goes up until your to
that threshold and then lastly you have
this internal clock timer for like your
actual display clock for everything so
yeah we're we're clocking the minutes
and an hour says they go by and so there
has to be some timer to do that
particular thing so we can add these
timers as sub machines and when we do
the results is what you see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
