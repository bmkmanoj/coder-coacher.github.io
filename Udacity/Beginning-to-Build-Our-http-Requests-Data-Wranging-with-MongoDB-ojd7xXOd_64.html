what the output looks like okay so all
this does is print out a complete
listing of all the airport codes and
above this all of the carrier codes now
it's these values then that we're going
to use in order to mine the data we need
from this particular data source so if
we're going to do that we need to have a
good understanding of exactly how
requests need to be formulated to this
website okay so let's take a closer look
then if we scroll up a little bit we can
see the form that's used to submit any
requests based on these selectors and
the submit button now anytime you're
doing a scraping task like this you
absolutely have to understand exactly
how the site expects requests some sites
are pickier than others some sites have
more security procedures built in or
more constraints that you're going to
have to deal with so our first step is
figuring out what URL we have to access
and what HTTP method we need to use so
the HTTP method is post and the URL we
need to access is this data elements
aspx URL passing it the parameter data
equals two now it turns out that that is
exactly this URL here so submitting this
particular form simply execute a request
against exactly the same URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
