transforming variables on our facebook
data set
most of our variables such as friend
count likes comments wall post and
others are variables that I would call
engagement variables and they all have
very long tails some users have 10 times
or even a hundred times the median value
another way to say this is that some
people have order of magnitudes more
likes clicks or comments than any other
users in statistics we say that the data
is over dispersed often it helps to
transform these values so we can see
standard deviations or orders of
magnitude so that we are in effect
shortening the tail here was our
histogram of friend count from before
and notice we still have that long tail
we can transform this variable by taking
the log either using the natural log log
base 2 or log base 10 we could also use
other functions such as the square root
and doing so helps us to see patterns
more clearly without being distracted by
the tails a lot of common statistical
techniques like linear regression are
based on the assumption that variables
have normal distributions so by taking
the log of this variable we can turns
form our data to turn it into maybe a
normal distribution or something that
more closely resembles a normal
distribution if we'd be using linear
regression or some other modeling
technique now I know we're not doing
modeling here but let's just see what it
looks like to transform the variable
first I'm going to just do this in the
summary command so here's our regular
summary of friend count looks like the
median friend count is 82 and the mean
is 196 I can take the log base 10 of
this front count and get a different
table now this seems a little bit
unusual since I have negative infinity
for the minimum and negative infinity
for the mean hmm so what must be going
on well some of our users have a friend
count of zero so when we take the log of
base 10 of zero that would be undefined
for those familiar with calculus the
limit would be negative infinity which
is why that appears here to avoid this
we're going to add one to friend count
so that way we don't get an undefined
answer or negative infinity there that
looks much better and just to show you
another function let's also use the
square root on friend count this would
be another type of transformation for me
log base 10 is an easier transformation
to wrap my head around since I'm just
comparing friend counts on orders of
magnitude of 10 basically a tenfold
scale like the
scale now that you've seen
transformations within summaries let's
see if you can apply a similar
transformation to the histogram check
out the instructor notes to learn about
how to use scales and how to create
multiple graphs on one page once you've
read through those links and you think
you're ready try this next programming
exercise in it you're going to create
three different histograms the first one
will be our original foreign count
histogram and then the second one will
have the friend count transform using
log 10 and the last histogram will have
the friend count transform using square
root now I haven't given you all the
information to do this exercise but I
want you to be resourceful part of being
a good programmer is being able to read
documentation and know how to find your
answers to the questions you may have
now we've already done the legwork for
you by providing the resource so let's
see if you can figure it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
