a half days for the pool to fill great
work if you found this this is the
equation that will use to help us solve
we can fill the pool and 10 hours and we
can drain one pool in 12 hours we know
that we need to subtract the 112th here
since it takes longer to drain the pool
than it does to fill it in other words
this rate is slower than this rate and
this should make sense since we know
112th is smaller than one-tenth so the
pool will fill up ever so slightly and
we can figure out the total time that it
takes to fill the pool this is X we
start solving this equation by
multiplying through by the LCD 60 X the
common factors of 10 and 12 are to the
other factor of 10 is 5 and the other
factor of 12 is 6 we multiply these
factors together which give a 60 and
then we have to multiply by X the other
factor in our denominators we multiply
by X since X is not a common factor of
10 or 12 so 60 X will be our LCD this
first term will reduce 26 x 60 / 10
equals 6 the second term will reduce to
five x since 60 divided by 12 equals 5
this leaves us with the right hand side
of just 60 combining our like terms on
the left we'll have 1 x equals 60 so x
equals 60 hours the time it takes to
fill the pool with the drain open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
