to store and keep track of numbers
another very popular type of variables
in Java is the string variable a string
variable is used to store names words or
even whole sentences basically anything
that's made up of characters in Java a
character is a single alphabetical
letter or digit or even a symbol like
the dollar sign or a hash or an @ pretty
much anything that you can use when
you're creating a password for example
so if you want to store a phrase or a
word that's made up of those characters
you should use a string variable that's
where the name string comes from being
like a string connecting bunch of
characters like this let's say we wanted
to store the bus drivers name in a
variable we first need to declare that
string variable and give it a name just
like we did with declaring integers we
start by typing in the variable type
which in this case is a string and then
the variable name which is something
that we come up with in this case I call
it driver this declaration statement is
like as if we've created this empty box
that can store a string inside but
remember it can only source strings from
now on not integers not anything else
just strings so the next thing we need
to do is initialize it notice that I've
surrounded this string here with
quotation marks remember what I use them
earlier with the print line this
basically means we're referring to the
word Hamish literally not a variable
called Hamish that's why this is called
a string literal this initialization
fills our box with the word Hamish
notice that if I didn't put the
quotation marks here the computer would
think that this is a variable called a
mesh and would try to find it and would
go crazy when it couldn't find it but
now since we have this new variable
driver and it has the word Hamish in it
there's actually a lot that Java can do
string variables are really cool
variables it can count the number of
letters in the string it can change the
string to all capital letters and it can
do a lot more that we're gonna see later
on let's start
by programming the computer to count the
letters in this string for that we can
use the length command that's written
lengths and then empty parentheses here
this instruction here would count the
number of letters inside the variable
driver not the word driver itself but
whatever is stored inside that variable
but we need to store that number in a
variable since letter counts are just
natural numbers we can use an integer
for that now that we've stored the
number of letters in the word hamish
inside that variable letters let's print
out the variable letters and see what it
displays if we run that program the
print output would be 6 which is exactly
the number of characters inside that
string here perfect let's see if we
wanted to change something in the string
like update every character to become a
capital letter for that we can use the
command to uppercase again it's just the
string variable dot this operation to
uppercase followed by empty parentheses
but we need to store that into our
string variable driver so we're
basically telling our computer program
to update the variable driver to be
equal to whatever the old driver
variable was but upper casing every
single letter making it capital letter
so let's print out our variable driver
to see what happened to it once we run
this program this is the output that we
get it's exactly the same string but
every letter is now a capital letter
thanks to this command to uppercase
there's another one called to lowercase
which obviously does the opposite and
there's more we'll learn a lot more
about strings and what we can do with
them later on
but next let's have a look at another
cool thing we can do with strings called
concatenation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
