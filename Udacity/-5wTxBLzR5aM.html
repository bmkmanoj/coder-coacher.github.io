create a dictionary we're using the
squiggly brackets on some keyboards
that's the shift on the square bracket
key maybe somewhere else on your
keyboard and we're going to use the
squiggly bracket list our elements in
the dictionary so each element of the
dictionary is a key value pair and the
entries in the dictionary will be the
elements and their atomic numbers so we
have the string hydrogen with its atomic
number one and we have carbon with
number six so we've created the
dictionary and what we see when we print
it out is the elements of the dictionary
now one thing you might notice is
they're not in the same order that we
put them there if you think about what
we did with hash tables this isn't so
surprising when we put elements and hash
tables well where they end up in the
hash table depends on the key and the
hash function is not necessarily in the
order that we put them in and with the
dictionary because it's implemented like
a hash table we see the same thing
unlike a list where the elements are
ordered with the dictionary there's no
order to the elements so when we print
it out they might appear in a different
order from the order that we put them in
we can use to indexing to look up one of
the elements so now when we look up the
value associated with hydrogen we get
one and if we look up the value
associated with carbon we get six what
do you think is going to happen if we
look up a value that's not in the
dictionary so now we're looking up the
value associated with lithium and what
we get is an error it's called the key
area key error it says that element is
not in the dictionary this is different
from how we define look up for our hash
table right we defined our look up to
return none when the element was not
there the way the built-in dictionary
type works is it gives us an error when
it's not there if we don't want to get
errors like that we can use the in to
see if an elements in the dictionary so
the in behaves similarly to ended for
lists we can say lithium in elements
that will evaluate to true if the key is
in the dictionary false otherwise so now
it evaluates to false so I said that
dictionaries were mutable so we can add
new elements and the way to add an
element is just to use an assignment so
we'll add lithium giving it value three
note that it was an error when we used
an LMS
like this as a look up when it's on the
left side for of an assignment well
that's an update so that corresponds to
the hash table update where lithium is
the key and three is the value we can
add another element let's add another
element will add nitrogen and now when
we look up nitrogen we get the value
that we assigned to nitrogen which is
eight turns out that eight is not
actually the correct value the atomic
number for nitrogen should be seven so
we can modify that value using another
assignment that's again the same as our
hash table update it won't create a new
key value because the key nitrogen is
already there but it will update the
value so now the value associated with
nitrogen will be seven so we can see the
first print the value is eight the
second print the value is now seven</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
