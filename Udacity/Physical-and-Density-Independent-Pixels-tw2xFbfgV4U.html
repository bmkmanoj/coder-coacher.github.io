of ground we'll talk about choosing the
right UI patterns laying out your
screens working with graphics and text
and a whole lot more but before we get
into all those really fun things we'll
first need to learn about one of the
core aspects of Android design that your
designs must work on a lot of often very
different devices Android runs on all
types of things from tiny watches to
phones and tablets even to cars and TVs
this variety can be daunting the good
news is that Android has been designed
to handle this variety and device types
from day one the platform gives you a
whole bunch of tools and techniques for
handling different devices easily and
gracefully your goal should be to create
a single app that runs across a range of
devices adapting the interface depending
on what device it's currently running on
as we'll find out throughout the course
optimizing the user experience across a
variety of device screen and form
factors isn't that difficult and could
actually be pretty fun let's start by
talking about the screens and all these
different devices at the end of the day
what good is designing beautiful buttons
text and graphics unless you understand
the screens they'll be shown on right
when thinking about the variety of
screens your app will run on it can be
tempting to look at the screens
resolution that's the number of pixels
on the screen screen resolution is a
commonly used spec when buying a device
but it's actually not that useful when
designing for Android because thinking
of screens in terms of pixels ignores
the notion of physical size which for
touch devices is really really important
when Android was first released there
was a single commercially available
device the t-mobile g1 as a result it
was easy and often common practice to
design with the resolution of this
device in mind mobile designers
accustomed to iOS where there was only
one form factor to design for would
apply those same practices to Android
and design assets for one or two
flagship devices with exact pixel sizes
these designs would look horrible when
viewed in a device with different
proportions Android 1.6 doughnut
introduced support for more varied
device types and densities recognizing
that generating pixel perfect assets for
every existing device doesn't scale and
that one would need a systematic way to
deal with assets on different screens to
better fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
