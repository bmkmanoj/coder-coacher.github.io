password-based authentication can be
implemented so we know the evidence
that's going to be provided is a
password a user is going to supply their
they're gonna type or touch the screen
or something like that and that's gonna
follow they're telling the system who
they are which typically they provide
the user ID so they type their user ID
and password let's say and the system
now has this task of well how do I know
this is the correct password for this
user and if it is the correct password
authentication will be successful so how
can we perform this check so you would
say well an obvious solution to this
problem is that we ask users to share
their passwords with the system so the
first time this is called registration
or enrollment or some outer band method
by which of course the system has to
know something about your secret if it
doesn't it can't check it so the let's
say the secret the you is password so we
have a set of users with passwords and
the system stores those passwords its
trusted system we let's say give it our
password and if we do that it's not a
good idea and actually we won't have to
do that but if we do that then how can
we do that check that we are talking
about I will see it's pretty
straightforward all we have to do is
impair the typed password with the one
that's stored so where do we store it we
have to store it in a file people come
back you turn the computer off and then
come back and login so this information
has to persist multiple sessions so
persistent information is stored in
files one thing we should be smart
enough to do is that only the trusted
root or admin be able to read this file
the login program is going to run on
behalf of them and they are the ones
you're going to check and you know
somebody's trying to authenticate
themselves so this file should be made
readable only by the admin or the the
root the most foolish user we have in
the system but what if we make a mistake
what if permissions are set incorrectly
the permissions I said incorrectly
somebody else may be able to read that
file and if they're able to read that
file they're able to learn everyone's
password which is not a good thing
even if the permissions are set right
why should an admin be able to know all
the passwords okay every users password
if they're no there's no reason for them
to have access to passwords of all users
in the system and the one reason we
don't want to have that is that in case
you have a security breach the passwords
are going to be exposed everyone's
password it's going to be exposed to
that hacker okay so it's clear that
something about the secret has to be
shared with the system the password has
to be shared with the system but storing
those secrets in a file even if you do
access control is not a good idea so can
we do better so indeed we can actually
do better and the way to think about
that is that we don't store the password
themselves but store something that is
derived from it it's not the actual
password but something that is possible
to to get hold off only if you had
access to the password at some point or
at least in the beginning or the
enrollment time or when the password
were changed and then you're not storing
the full password but just something
derived from it the question is if
you're storing something to write from
it what is it and how do you use it the
result that we derived from password one
way to do that is to use what is called
a one-way function this functions are
called hash functions hash functions are
widely used to take an arbitrary length
input and produce a fixed size output
okay that is fairly unique to the input
and one way basically says that it's
easy to compute given the input the hash
value is easy to compute but it's very
hard to compute the input if you just
had the hash value so such functions
exist we're going to talk about some
examples of those so thing to remember
here is that a given a password it
produces a hash value of that password
and going from password the hash value
is straightforward going in the other
direction
which is from hash value - the password
is really really hard so what we're
gonna do is we're going to use a
function like that
so rather than storing the password
we're going to store something derived
from it in particular we're gonna store
a hash value and that's what we going to
have and even the hash values that we
have those have to be stored in a file
as earlier we are talking about storing
the passwords in a file even this file
should be readable only for the
privileged user or the admin user that
we are talking about on whose behalf the
login program is going to run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
