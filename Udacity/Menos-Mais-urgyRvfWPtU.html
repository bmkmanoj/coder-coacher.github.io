visualization we are looking at the
average price of one carat diamonds
between the years of 1978 in 1982 what
this is trying to convey is that while
the price of diamonds peaked in 1980
there's been a sharp decline in the two
years leading up to nineteen eighty-two
we can see here that the price is fallen
from sixty thousand dollars to twenty
thousand dollars given the decreasing
demand there are a few problems with
this visualization which makes it hard
to interpret as a viewer let's start
with a picture of the woman while this
particular visual is interesting it
takes up a great deal of space and isn't
adding any additional information also
the underlying chart axes make it hard
to detect where each point on the line
is in relation to the year in price the
grid lines which show something like
graph paper are meant to convey this is
something chart like but they detract
from the main visualization here the
data is actually only represented by
this red line everything else about this
visualization including the picture of
the woman the grid lines and the
background are all detracting from the
main event which is that the price of
Diamonds has fallen from the years of
nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty-two
let's look at an example how we can
improve this visualization to make it
something that is much more clear here
we see the same visualization with the
woman and the price of diamonds between
the years of 1978 and 1982 by removing
the elements such as the picture the
grid lines and putting standard axes for
both x and y we can see the same
information much more clearly we've also
added dots to indicate the data points
for each of the x and y values this
graph will not as salacious is the
original is much easier to read and much
more clearly shows the relation between
the years and the price of diamonds over
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
