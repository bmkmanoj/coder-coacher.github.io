introduce graphics remember that our
goal is to render a webpage to make a
picture that corresponds to a webpage
that means we need some way to make a
picture and it may not be obvious how
we'll do that in Python it turns out
that just as we used a library for
regular expressions and parsing and even
timing procedures if you remember that
example from before we're gonna use a
library someone else's code to do
graphics this ability by the way to
build on existing off-the-shelf
components is one of the phenomenal
advantages of computer science compared
to other parts of engineering it's very
easy to copy someone else's library and
build on top of it much harder to copy
someone else's building without actually
reconstructing it yourself so there are
four key functions in our graphics
library that are worth knowing about the
graphics dot word you pass in a single
word and we'll draw it on the screen or
on the picture we're making for you
graphics dot begin tag is a bit more
complicated you have to tell us both the
type of the tag and also any arguments
it might have for example suppose it's
an anchor tag a link in a web page we
need to know what the destination of the
link is no have you passed that in as a
dictionary mapping href to Google then
after that you could call and display a
bunch of other words and those would all
be underlined or they would show up in
blue or however we draw web links
eventually we can end the most recent
tag and there's also a way to display
warnings which is basically just for
your benefit if you're trying this out
and later assignments this gives you a
way of debugging maybe this will show up
in some bold red color or something like
that so that you can't miss it so let's
imagine that we have the following web
page input Nelson Mandela was elected
democratically I'm going to show you the
sequence of calls to the graphics
library that we would want know
conceptually the first thing we're going
to do is print out the word Nelson on
the screen then we'll want to print out
the word Mandela on the screen then we
want to tell the graphics library that
for a while subsequent words should be
bolded so we'll begin a bold tag this
bold tag doesn't have any arguments so
I'll just pass in the empty dictionary
that didn't actually draw anything on
the screen it's just a note to begin
drawing in bold
can imagine changing out your pen for
something that draws in a different
color
now we instruct our graphics library to
write the word was but it's going to be
bolded now we write the word elected and
now we're done with things in bold so we
back out of our most recent tag finally
we'll add the word democratically and
the period this depends a bit on how our
lexer works but remember that our
definition for word was sort of anything
that's not whitespace or angle brackets
so this period will be part of the same
word and then it will be the
responsibility of our graphics library
to do things like wrapping when we get
to the end of the page to decide what
bolt looks like and then to display the
image back to you
so these one two three four five six
seven calls produce this image that's
how we're going to make our web browser
well we're here Nelson Mandela was
actually the first South African
president in a fully representative
democratic election and he went on to
win the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize plus a
host of other honors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
