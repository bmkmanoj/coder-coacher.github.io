this class I'm reasonably sure you're
all familiar with online learning
because you're all doing it right now
when most people think about online
learning I think what they think about
though our MOOCs massive open online
courses moocs cut very big for a few
years there and they're still very big
and so we're actually going to have an
entire separate section on MOOCs but
online learning is more than just MOOCs
nowadays you're all doing online
learning but you're not in the MOOC this
class is not massive its large but it's
not massive and it's not open you all
applied to this program and you were
accepted so it's neither massive nor
open but still an online course what we
do here at Udacity nowadays is similar
we don't allow to do massive open online
courses we do smaller very large but
still smaller than massive open online
courses programs there's somewhat more
gated that have a cost associated with
them and have a credential at the end
and I think programs like you'd ask
these nano degrees and the Georgia Tech
OMS CS program are really the future of
online learning these more closed and
more gated experiences so what we're
gonna talk about here is the different
ways that online learning can be done
separate from MOOCs so what are the
experiences we can have an online
learning that would be difficult or
impossible to have on campus are the
things we can do here that are actually
even better than we could do on campus
and there are certain things we can do
in person that we can't do online but
how do we make up for them how do we
create an equivalent experience in this
online environment to what you might get
on campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
