before but I've abbreviated it still
further instead of identifiers I've just
written ID and instead of number I've
just written num this sort of
abbreviation is all too common in
computer science programmers can't help
it unfortunately it's a bit of a vice
because while it's easy for me to see
what's going on it can be hard for
someone reading it later myself included
to tell what my variable names mean
whenever possible you should take the
time to make your variable names as
descriptive as possible add lots of
comments it turns out that ninety
percent of software is maintenance just
like a popular book is read many more
times than it's written a program is
read or maintained or executed many more
times than it's written so it's worth
taking the time to do it right the first
time that said clearly I'm not so this
must be one of those do what I say and
not what I do bad professor sorts of
maneuvers regardless back on track
here's the grammar statement goes to
identify or equals expression and
expression is the same sort of
arithmetic we've seen before we're now
going to consider this particular
sentence eg draws ill equals 6-5 so I've
written out a parse tree a bit squashed
at the bottom but still recognizable for
this phrase egged rasili quills 6-5 but
I've forgotten to labels it's quiz time
fill in the blanks what would have to go
in each of these blanks in order for
this parse tree to match this input
utterance according to this grammar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
