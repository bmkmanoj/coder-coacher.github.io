have extra parameters not just the value
so let me let me draw an out in an
example cookie for you here's a here's
an example set cookie header for setting
this cookie whose name is named nice and
confusing whose value is Steve and now
we've added a couple extra parameters we
got a semicolon to end the value we've
added this domain parameter and this is
what domain this cookie is relevant to
so in this case it is relevant to
wwe.com and this is the path that it's
relevant to so the path is easier to
explain basically you can put whatever
you want here and in this case this is
the default path if you don't specify a
path we just assume you mean slash and
this is actually the most common use
case of cookies you the cookie applies
to all of the paths but if you want to
restrict the cookie to a particular path
you can specify that path here in the
browser we'll make sure that the path
you're requesting starts with this value
before it sends the cookie so the domain
is much more interesting and much more
complex and let's let's talk about this
a little bit so this means that
basically this cookie will not get sent
by the browser to the server unless the
server's domain is wwr editcom or
basically ends with wwe.com so domain
set this work for our for example
wwe.com food at wwe.com domain set that
will not receive this cookie would be
for example just reddit calm without the
W or bar editcom because this cookie was
restricted to W w so basically the site
you're at has to begin or I mean sorry
end with wwe.com you can't set cookies
to just calm you have to have at least
two periods so the minimum domain you
can set a cookie for is period reddit
calm if you try to set for just reddit
calm that first period will
automatically get added that controls
that the main controls which domain a
browser will send a cookie to what about
you know can I have a can I have a web
server at reddit calm that sets a cookie
for
calm the answer is no similar to how the
domain parameter restricts which domains
a browser will send a cookie to the
domain who's serving the request the
basically the domain of the web server
that of the webpage you may only set a
cookie to that domain or higher so if
we're at dub dub dub ready calm the
browser will only accept cookies for by
default dub dub dub ready calm if
there's no domain parameter there's a
domain parameter the only valid domains
are dub dub dub that reddit comm or
reddit comm we can't set a cookie for
bar editcom or Fuu dot reddit.com and
and this is to prevent you know if you
have multiple websites kind of sharing
the same top-level domain you know have
spot comm for example you know you don't
I can't set a cookie on in my app that
affects the behavior of your app I can
only set a cookie that gets sent with
dub dub dub and with the top level
that's how the domain restrictions work
let's have a little quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
