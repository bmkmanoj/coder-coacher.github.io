get rid of mobile phones in the home why
because more what do mobile phones do
they do this I'm using it and I'm it's
distancing between the loved ones yeah
my hope is that over the next 10 to 20
years just like when you come home and
you take off your shoes and you take off
your jacket you take your mobile phone
and you throw it in the corner and
that's the old has has its they're all
those great resources computing is there
but it's a voice recognition voice
recognition but you know we're you're
gonna it's gonna recognize your gate
who's home it's going to recognize the
voice of who's there it's going to
recognize which room you're in and it's
the computing is going to be ambient
around you so even your pc disappears
and if you even your DC disappear he
looks somewhere when you need is you
have it and the only time you're going
to have a display is when you're going
to do group viewing so you want to get
around and watch a movie or do what have
it do what have you as a family our goal
is to get rid of the technology barriers
between you and your loved ones so you
would save you only one to three percent
into the internet of things are the more
we are at the very earliest earliest
days this is this is like the app we
rated R with the Apple two days of the
Internet of Things in the home it's true
you just left appleone things to ness is
true we don't know if I initial devices
that's sounding great for students
because you put this together with the
question what makes you uncomfortable
there's so many things i hate about my
home little doctor fix so many great
startup companies to be built such a
great field to be in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
