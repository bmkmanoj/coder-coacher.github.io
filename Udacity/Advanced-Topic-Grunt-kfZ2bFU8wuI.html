build tool which is called grunt and I'm
going to help you get started with print
so right now which I have actually
cloned the project into my local
repository and it actually resides
inside the downloads folder I'm going to
open my terminal and install something
called nodejs um no chance is a scalable
application that will help you you know
create all the necessary build tool
requirements all the files that you need
for your optimization so right now what
I have to do is you can go to nodejs and
directly install it from here um so if
you go to the downloads um you can see
that you have a windows installer a mac
and you have the source code um so since
i'm on a mac i am going to be in
installing that package that is already
given to me what I'm going to do is I am
going to initialize a 10pm command into
my project repository so to initialize n
p.m. I need a JSON file that will arm
actually point me to the name of the
project and the dependencies I am giving
for this project for example you you now
see my package.json open which I have
actually put inside my root directory on
so what package.json essentially has is
a name for my grunt project so I just
named it example project and I've given
a diversion this is going to be my first
1.0 version so that that is the version
number and there is an end dependencies
that you have to provide arm which is
called def dependencies which tells you
which bill to i'm using so you have a
lot of the tools grunt gulp so i'm going
to be using grunt and i have specified
the version of grunt 4.1 and about
versions are going to be supported um so
right now what I'm going to do is pseudo
and P
yum install so i did a pseudo NPM
install just install NPM command what i
do after the NPM install is to run
grunts CLI um and once that is done what
i have to do is I have a file called run
5ks which again you guys will be
creating something where you actually
specify all the grunt modules that you
are going to be important to use grunt
to run specific tasks so for instance i
am going to use an other fight um
package that is going to minify my J's
files and make it sorry oh coo coo yeah
that's what you call it agri fire layer
also as you can see it says module dot
net exports equals function grunt so
this is going to be the Grand file that
the crunch function is going to take in
and it's going to look at all the tasks
that i have defined um so it says that i
am going to build on this source which
is this j s file and the destination is
going to be this JS file and then i'm
going to load the npm tasks on using
this package and then i'm going to
register this task so when i run the
ground command it is supposed to run on
this oglaf I package and it is going to
give you a min ified version of your
JavaScript the next step of this would
be to actually install this package on
so the same dependencies is actually
going to save the package name into your
JSON file so I'm going to copy it and
what i'll do is i will replace this with
the uglify package that i have installed
right here and i'm going to replace this
name here and then give a safe also
let's see what this returns hopefully
this will execute and it says I haven't
error so it says please try running the
come on as a root or an administrator so
I probably should have to give sumo here
since um I am authorizing it as the root
so once i do that um I feel like uglify
is going to load and it's morning and it
looks like I thought if I got installed
I can check this by going to my
package.json and you can see this here
um I'll if I shows up here on after this
once i have actually downloaded the
package i just run grunt from here and
it's going to take it and it says are
running uglify build one file created
which should be my minified file so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to navigate
and inside my Jas you can see I have my
minified file that ground created um so
as you can see you have other packages
on um grunt like um image minification
HTML minification dreis info of packages
and other ones that will help you go
ahead I'm actually making your content
in your website efficient and render
efficient please so the reason what's
the reason to use grunt right like it
seems like a fair amount of work to get
set up diving grunting but then why
what's the value why do people do it so
one thing is grunt helps you separate
your development and production version
of code so you still keep still get to
keep the unbent five code which is very
useful for development right for
minified code is not readable you're not
able to see what you have actually
radiated so it's going to be very ugly
you need to unman fight and then use it
but it with grunt you can get to keep
your development code and yeah you know
produce a set of other code that can be
used to run your website right so that
is one reason why you have to run give
it like how often we make changes to our
projects that we might start you know
when we start a project we want to just
get something going we iteratively
develop we increment
you build up each time he can kind of
test your code you can just run a runt
and builds everything you have your
production mobile website codes you push
it out it runs but then when you want to
make changes you just run grunt again
rather than having to manually minify
every time or run each of these scripts
it manages all of that for ya so it's
worth the setup is it worth doing these
pages at the beginning for your project
and then the more you do it easily yeah
I know this file can be used for your
other projects as well your package on
JSON and jochen judge grand final de
geus can be used for your other quote
only that you have to alter the path
that you give inside that you are
targeting but you can use this as a
standard for all your projects that
you're you know building your production
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
