cybersecurity actually before we get
into the cyber side of things let's talk
about when or why do we worry about
security we worry about securing
something or we worry about the security
problem when we have something of value
but there also has to be a threat source
that poses some kind of a risk to it so
clearly you worry about security when
there's something of value and you
perceive that there's risk that is posed
to that thing that is of value so let's
get back to cyber security now so let's
ask those same questions what is of
value in the context of cyber security
and where do the threats come from what
kind of risk are we talking about who is
the source of the threat in terms of
what is of value all of us tor lot of
sensitive data if criminals if they get
their hands on to this sensitive data
that we are talking about of course they
can monetize it and profit from it and
it is no exaggeration to say that
society is actually rely on the Internet
for really important things so these are
again you know critical resources that
we all rely on which could be attractive
targets for our adversaries in this case
the reasons may be different from simply
profiting from it to look at sort of a
quick example of what we just talked
about in particular critical
infrastructure people talk about smart
grids they're basically talking about
the electric power generation
distribution billing all the different
things that we do to make sure that we
have electricity when we need it if
their computer is controlling the smart
grid
whoever sort of takes control of those
computers is controlling a extremely
important infrastructure on which the
community relies obviously every
business and government agency now use
computers and networks to carry out what
they're supposed to do their daily
activities but what happens if hacker
adversaries or unauthorized parties gain
access to it so it's an easy argument to
make that cybersecurity is extremely
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
