you we're going to facilitate learning
and discussion on different biological
concepts as well as some social issues
Before we jump in we want to take a
brief moment to mention our course
expectations for you as well as give you
a little orientation on how to interact
with us here now first and foremost this
course is going to require time
commitment so be prepared
but the joys of online learning means
that you can take the course however
you're most comfortable hey guys what do
you want to do tonight oh sure we can do
cause this course is 12 lessons long and
each lesson is going to vary on the time
commitment it requires and level of
difficulty and that brings us to our
second expectation and interaction you
may think our lessons are confined to
this video screen but in reality you can
actually interact with us through this
screen to stopping to think and
answering questions can really
facilitate a future learning so we're
going to ask you questions from time to
time we want you to click to respond or
type in a short response now it's
important for you to remember that these
interactions are not graded we want you
to think of these as learning
opportunities now if anything is unclear
check out the solution video for help or
you can go back and re-watch videos for
example we might ask who are the coolest
genome guides ever go ahead and pick
which answer you think is best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
