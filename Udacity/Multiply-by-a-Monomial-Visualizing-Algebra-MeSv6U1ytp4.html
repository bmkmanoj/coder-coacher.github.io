the fifth excellent work if you reason
through that one if you weren't sure
where to start always start with a
rectangle we know this is one number so
this can be one side of our rectangle
this is our second number 7 m squared
plus 5 m to the fourth will want to
split it up into two parts since we have
7 m squared plus 5 m to the fourth these
would be different numbers think about
it if M were to this number would be 28
and this number would be 90 but we
really don't know what M is so we have
to leave it with these expressions next
we multiply 3 M by each of the terms to
find the area 3m x 7 m squared is 21 m
cubed there's a one as the exponent on
the M so remember to add the exponents
when multiplying with the same base our
two numbers three and seven just get
multiplied as usual next we multiply 3m
x 5m to the fourth that will give us the
area of this rectangle 3 times 5 is 15
and M times n to the fourth is M to the
fifth we don't have like terms here so
we can't add these together we have an
area of 21 m cubed and an area of 15 m
to the fifth this is our total area
instead of writing your answer like this
you might have listed your answer like
this or rearrange the terms and written
your answer like this this one is
actually preferred it's in standard form
because the highest exponent comes first
when writing your answers for the rest
of this lesson you'll want to write them
in standard form variables are usually
listed alphabetically and the highest
powers come first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
