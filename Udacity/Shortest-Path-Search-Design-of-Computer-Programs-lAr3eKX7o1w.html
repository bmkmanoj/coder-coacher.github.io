specific solver we had a specific one
for the pouring problem and went for the
missionaries and cannibals and let's
generalize them and I'm going to call
the generalization shortest path search
so that's a search for the shortest path
that reaches a goal and let's take our
inventory the concepts we have to deal
with we've got paths States actions
successors we have a start state we have
a goal and so now let's figure out how
we're going to represent each of these
concepts well pass we already had I
don't see any reason to change so we
have state action state and notice we're
just doing shortest path search we're
not doing best cost search we don't need
to put in the total cost in here we can
just have the action by itself we have
states and here the states can be atomic
we don't have to know anything about the
states in other words a state can be
anything that a particular problem wants
to deal with and shortest path search
doesn't have to know about that now why
is that the case because shortest path
search can can interface with States
through these two functions through
successors and through the goal function
and through the start state so what do I
mean by that so the start state is going
to be some atomic state we don't know
anything more about that shortest path
doesn't know anything more about that
when we go to use shortest path search
for a particular problem then we have to
specify what a state looks like but
shortest path search itself doesn't have
to know all it has to know is that if
you give the start state to the
successor function so successor will be
a function which takes a state as input
and returns a dictionary of state action
pairs now given that initial state that
we were passed in we can generate new
states and new actions and so the
actions also are atomic shortest path
search doesn't have to know anything
about the representation other than that
this is where they come from from the
successor function now what about the
goal well we could specify an exact
state that we're looking for but
sometimes we're looking for multiple
states we could specify a set of states
but sometimes the set of state
is really big there's lots of states
that satisfy the goal so instead let's
have the goal be a function it's a
function when you pass it a state it
returns a boolean true or false is that
the goal and with that now we're ready
to specify a shortest path search so
shortest path search is going to be a
function it's going to take some inputs
and it's going to return a path and in
return the failure as a path if it can't
find a solution and now the question is
out of this inventory which of these
things do we have to pass in to shortest
path search to allow us to solve a
problem check all those that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
