to host your web app right now we're
using Google App Engine but there are
plenty of other alternatives and some of
them are Amazon AWS lai node Rackspace
if you Google web application hosting
services you should probably find many
many options Amazon AWS is what Steve
uses for Hipmunk I believe it's what he
used for reddit as well and he really
likes AWS and he would recommend it
there are plenty of other options though
and plenty of other options where you
can use Python migrating it from one
service to another can be a little bit
complicated and depending on the size of
your web application it can be worth it
or it can be something that you really
don't want to do just because it would
take your application offline or just be
too much complication to deal with at
the time we're going to be talking about
that a lot more in unit 7 unit 7 is
basically going to be about the problems
that Steve has run into himself in
building web applications and the
solutions he came up with the solutions
he wished he came up with and things
like that there are a lot of questions
related to that how to migrate from one
service to another how to come up with
an idea and pitch it to people how to
make sure that lots of people see your
site and can find your site so we'll be
going over all those kinds of questions
in unit 7 so stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
