should always be doing when I'm
practicing machine learning and that
we've neglected so far which is
visualizing our results so let me do
that right now so what I do here make a
scatter plot of all my data points and
then I also read a line like this PLT
plot is going to draw a line the
x-values of some of the points along the
line will be the ages and the y-values
will be the predictions for the ages
that are given to me by the regression
so these are kind of like the features
and the predictions and then this is
just some formatting information then I
apply some labels and I show it and I
use the show command to see it and it
gives me a picture that looks like this
where these are all the points that we
had just like before and now I've
overlaid them with this blue line and
just by eye you can tell the regression
isn't doing anything crazy
always a good sanity check is just to
look at the results of your regression
especially if it's one-dimensional
regression like this where you only have
one input variable like the ages then
it's very straightforward to just look
at it by eye and see how things are
going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
