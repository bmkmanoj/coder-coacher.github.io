of a set of guidelines than a protocol
itself this is because it takes the HTTP
protocol and applies a few constraints
to clarify communication and resource
management in this video I will go more
in depth as to what these constraints
mean for us as API developers the first
constraint of a restful implementation
is the separation of clients and servers
a client is defined as a machine
requesting a resource where the server
is the machine that responds with the
requested resource a machine can
function as a client and as a server but
for the duration of an HTTP request and
response cycle it must assume the role
is either the requester of the
information or the holder of that
information a stateful architecture
remembers a client's activity between
requests if you've ever used a website
where you have a shopping cart or login
session it appears as though the server
is remembering your activity throughout
the duration of your time on the website
a truly restful architecture however is
not allowed to retain information about
the state of another machine during the
communication process each requests from
a client to a server must be treated as
though it was the first request the
server has ever seen from that client a
server should not remember its clients
and readjusted state accordingly the
server may only give back the most
up-to-date information about its state
to the client and allow for
modifications if the client is
authorized to do so in lesson 4 you will
see how using tokens is a good way to
have a stateless design that can create
an experience that seems state
remembering to the user response
messages from the server to the client
are explicitly labeled as cashable or
non casual this way responses can be
cached by the client if the information
on the server hasn't changed since the
last request
restful architectures must have a
uniform interface between all clients
and servers for example a server must
not require a different way of accessing
data if a client is a Windows laptop
versus an iPhone or a UNIX server
gaining access to these endpoints is the
same for any machine trying to access
this information a layered system means
that a client can have access to an
endpoint that relies on other endpoints
without having to know and understand
all of the underlying implementations
if client a wants to communicate with
server B and that server goes out to
Google or some other database in order
to generate a response
client age did not have to accommodate
for any other technologies besides
accessing server B's endpoint layering
allows very complicated tasks to be
completed without having to understand
all of the underlying complexities that
were required to generate the response
code on-demand is an optional constraint
for restful applications but it opens
the possibility for code like JavaScript
for example from the server to be sent
off to the client for execution for more
about the rest four constraints feel
