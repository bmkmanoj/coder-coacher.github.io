internationalization and localization a
lot of our students are all across the
world and how do we support something on
that scale ok sure so it's actually not
that hard the hardest part is doing the
translation there's a package you can
use called get texts and this is built
into Python and in most major languages
and basically what you do is in your
templates you you either put all of your
strings in one place in one module and
then your templates and in that module
you I think a Python it's it's the
function that we use this it looks like
an underscore and you just put all your
strings inside this underscore function
and then you just have a separate file
that's a database of all of the you know
for in our case english-language strings
to whatever language and then your
website just kind of works and well you
basically say here's the language I want
to use here's where I store all my my
translation files and then everything
will just kind of translate on its own
so basically Google for get text debt
text Python and you'll see a whole bunch
of information on how do you will
include and will include some links on
that in the office hours instructor
comments just to help you guys out great
ok that's why see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
