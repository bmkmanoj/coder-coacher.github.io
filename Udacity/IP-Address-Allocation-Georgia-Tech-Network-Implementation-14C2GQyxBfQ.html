space is allocated to Internet service
providers at the top of the hierarchy is
an organization called the internet
assigned numbers Authority or Ayane
Ayane has the authority to allocate
address space to what are called
regional routing registries for Africa
the regional registry is called AfriNIC
for Asia and Australia the registry is
called ap Nick for North America it's
Erin for Latin America it's Lac Nick and
for Europe it's ripe Erin in turn
allocates address space to individual
networks like Georgia Tech the address
space across registries is far from even
now this graph is from a journal article
that's a little bit dated now but it
gives you an idea of how many slash
eight address allocations have been
allocated to each of the regional
registries so as of 2005 North America
had 23 slash eights allocated to it but
the entire continent of Africa had only
one now recent news is that I Anna
actually finished allocating all
remaining slash eight Internet address
blocks essentially meaning that we're
out of ipv4 address space so when you
hear that we're out of ipv4 addresses it
doesn't mean that you can no longer
attach a new device to the internet
their various ways for coping with this
pressure on address space what that
means is that Ayana
no longer has any more slash eight
blocks to give to these regional
registries querying an IP address using
who is in a routing registry such as RA
net will tell you the owner of that
particular prefix for example if we run
a whoís query on an IP address at
Georgia Tech it will tell us that that
IP address is from a slash 16 allocation
that Georgia Tech is the owner of the
prefix and it's associated with this
autonomous system number the routing
registry entry also gives us some
additional information such as who to
contact if we need to contact the owner
of this address space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
