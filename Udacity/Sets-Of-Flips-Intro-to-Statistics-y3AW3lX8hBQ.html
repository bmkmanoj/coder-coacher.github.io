the reading interesting question its
assignment number two and again it's a
programming assignment feel free to skip
now do they have a function flip that
gives me this list of a thousand
outcomes from which I cannot derive
things like the mean run this thing
itself a thousand times and each time
you get a different mean so this means
zero mean one and so on all the way to
mean 999 and these means are continuous
values obviously between zero and one
and give me the same functions before
mean variance standard deviation and
flip and as I scroll down I find this
function sample and I want you to put in
code over here so that when I sample
with the same n I run the flip
experiment a thousand times and every
single time I compute the mean and now I
assemble a list of all the means into
this thing called outcomes the means
will be continuous I can do a history
plot you'll be better with many bins so
this notation of a gives me 30 bins and
to give you a feel for what to expect
this is a typical histogram I get out as
a result it's really beautiful if I
increase n to 2000 I get this histogram
over here apologize the numbers aren't
illegible over here but the center of it
is 0.5 and it falls off to smaller
numbers to the left or to the right you
can think of this as a distribution over
the means outcomes of large numbers of
coin flips and has an interesting shape
so go ahead and program it and see if
you can reproduce these results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
