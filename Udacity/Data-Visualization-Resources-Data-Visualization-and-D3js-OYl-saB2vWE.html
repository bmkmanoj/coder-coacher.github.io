that you've learned so far I want you to
hear from Scott and Cole again they're
going to share some amazing resources so
that you can create great data
visualizations what tools are resources
would you recommend that students use
there are things like t3 right there
like JavaScript libraries and these
tools that are built to help you build
totally customized visualizations so
that's sort of like on the advanced end
on the other hand you have tools that
are a little more like create kind of
pre-canned visualizations like a chart
wizard built into Microsoft Excel or or
also like open office or LibreOffice
like these other sort of office type
programs which are really great or
Apple's numbers does similar things
tableau I think is a fantastic tool for
starting out and they just came out with
a mac version which is great as it opens
up to a lot of us who use macs and
tableau I don't want to say it makes
like if they're not like canned
visualizations but it lets you just like
really fast drop a data set on there and
give yourself like a number of visual
representations of that data so you're
like oh show me this as a bar chart show
it to me as a area chart line chart
whatever or if this Geographic data like
show me this data on a map like in a
really fast way so that's an awesome
sort of like exploratory to land on the
technical side you know this like the
other end of the spectrum from d3 now in
between there's a lot of stuff in
between like other chart libraries or
online tools the tools I think I'm
excited about right now are sort of in
this in-between place where where they
let you sort of dumped your data in and
generate some sort of visualization but
it's not trying to be the final
visualization and then you export that
bring it into some other tool and start
adjusting it so for example there's tool
out of the density design lab in Italy
called raw as capital R aw and you put
some basically drop your data on it and
if figures out sort of this is a
representation I think will work but it
doesn't give you
and it's all like in one page it's kind
of like 123 you just go down this list
and then you get like a graphic of some
sort and then you take that graphic and
you export it and maybe bring it into
illustrator or some other program where
you can do kind of the manual steps so
then you can say Oh couple nice at my my
fills and strokes and reposition things
I think that's like really nice and
really powerful because it doesn't
involve any coding it doesn't involve a
steep learning curve and it also doesn't
burden you with an interface that gives
you a million like options for
customization it's just saying I'm just
going to get you started and like get
you past that initial push so you get
this one graphic and then you can take
it and tweak it so there's a lot of
exciting stuff like that I think that
you use so what tools are resources
would you recommend for students who are
getting started be it maybe it's a blog
or a particular software tool that you
use sure so when it comes to tools i
think my number one piece of advice is
try not to let your tool be a limiting
factor right take the tool that you know
and get to know it as well as you can
most tools can be bent to meet your
needs and you can add more tools to
repertoire over time but the knowledge
of fancy tools need not be a barrier for
entry in this space I for example do
almost all of my work in Excel because
it's still the most pervasive for
business communications which is where I
spend the majority of my time when it
comes to other resources out there there
is a wealth of information in the
blogosphere and a lot of really great
content one word of advice is you know
there's a lot of not great content as
well so be a discerning purveyor of data
visualizations right when you come
across a graph in a newspaper or in a
blog study it and note what you like and
what you don't like and work to emulate
those things that you see in other
people's work that works well and avoid
the bad when it comes to some specific
blogs that I'd recommend and again
they're a whole lot of good ones out
there but I'll go through just a couple
of my favorites today first off is the
functional art so this is done by
Alberto Cairo he has a book of the same
name that we talked about briefly
next is visualizing data which Andy Kirk
runs flowing data is Nathan yao's blog
and he curates a lot of stuff that other
people do and yeah another good example
and then I'd be remiss not to mention my
own blog at storytelling with data
actually one more resource while we're
flipping through pages here is John
schwäbisch a--'s help me viz so we
talked earlier about seeking feedback
this is a place where you can actually
submit data visualizations and get
feedback from the community and has been
growing and has some really good content
also as you're interested in just
looking for data visualizations and
examples of good stuff and bad stuff
it's a nice place to flip through
wonderful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
