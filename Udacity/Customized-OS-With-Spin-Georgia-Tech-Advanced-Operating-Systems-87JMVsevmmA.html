domain is the ability to extend spin to
include operating system services and
make they're all part of the same
hardware address space so no border
crossing between the services or the
mechanisms provided by spin so here is
one example where all these system
services are implemented as protection
domain and using creates resolve and
combined we've created all these
services as logical extensions of spin
here is another extension living on top
of the same hardware concurrently with
the first extension and as you see each
of these mounts represent a completely
different operating system and each of
these mounts may have their own
subsystems for the same functionality
for instance this process uses memory
manager - this process uses memory
manager 1 both of them implement the
same functionality but very differently
hopefully to cater to the needs of the
applications that need those services
but they may also have common subsystems
for example the network protocol stack
may be shared by both extensions that
live on top of the same Hardware
framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
