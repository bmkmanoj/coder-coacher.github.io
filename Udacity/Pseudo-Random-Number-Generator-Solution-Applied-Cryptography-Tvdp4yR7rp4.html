problem with the first option is it
doesn't provide the unpredictability
property that we need if an attacker
knows x0 they can easily compute x1 and
that's a property our pseudo random
number generator needs to have the third
option seems reasonable it requires a
lot of randomness in the pool but if we
have that much randomness in the pool to
extract a new random value for each
random output well we should just use
that right if we do have enough
randomness for this there's no reason
for all these other steps we should just
extract something for the random pool
each time and we're not able to do this
we're assuming we don't have enough
randomness to do that so we're using
things that aren't actually random here
if we're extracting them from the random
pool more quickly than we're actually
able to produce new randomness here it's
doing a lot of extra work but it's
eventually starting to use values that
are not random as the inputs to our
encrypt and if those values are
predictable well then the outputs become
predictable too so that doesn't work so
the best solution is this middle one
where we're extracting a seed once we're
reusing that seed and we're encrypting a
sequence of values which is can just be
a counter and each time using the output
of that encryption</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
