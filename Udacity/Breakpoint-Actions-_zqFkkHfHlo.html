commands and each of the commands is now
another tool that you can use when
you're paused at a breakpoint I hope
you're beginning to see a pattern and
how we can use breakpoints and tools
together that is that we can set
breakpoints and then we get our apps to
reach breakpoints and then we can use
tools to examine our applications while
they're paused but there are also some
other interesting ways that we can edit
the very nature of a breakpoint so that
it doesn't necessarily pause an
application for example we can modify
breakpoints so that they only pause in
certain circumstances like only pause
after the tenth bug is created instead
of just the first bug or we can make
breakpoints that don't pause the
applications at all instead they can
perform some behavior and then just let
the application continue running for
instance don't pause play a sound to
achieve these kinds of behaviors will
use breakpoint actions and specifically
that's what breakpoint actions are
they're behaviors that are triggered
when a breakpoint is reached so didn't
demonstrate I'm going to start in the
breakpoint navigator and right now we
have no breakpoints I've removed the
ones that we had but let's add one for
the add bug to view there we go so now
it shows up and if we right-click a
breakpoint then a context menu and pops
up and we can select this option to edit
the breakpoint and here's where the fun
happens but before we add an action or
break the breakpoint action let's work
with the other fields first so we see
this condition field at the top and this
allows us to specify condition that must
be true in order for a breakpoint to be
active so for this breakpoint let's
specify that the count of but of the
bugs array must be greater than three
before the breakpoint is triggered and
to do this I'll type in the expression
bugs dot count is greater than three and
we'll hit enter and let's go ahead and
run the application and stopped and if
we look down and bugs we can see that we
have four image views so break or the
bugs are greater than three and our
break point has now been triggered so
let's stop this and go
back and edit our break point again and
I'll clear the condition and this time
let's set the ignore times before
stopping value we'll make it to and
around the app tap the screen and there
we go it ignored it the first two times
and created two bugs and now we're on
the third iteration through and about to
create our third bug
let's stop this one more time go back to
the breakpoint navigator and edit again
so we'll make sure this is zero and this
time let's select this check box that
says automatically continue after
evaluating actions and we'll run this
again and when we click it appears that
the break point has been skipped however
that's not exactly the case it only
looks like the breakpoints being skipped
what's happening is because there are no
breakpoint actions specified the
breakpoint was triggered but then
immediately evaluated zero actions and
continued so if we add an action we can
prove that something else should have
happened so edit and the first action
type that we'll look at is the debugger
command action and this includes a text
field for entering any valid commands
that we could use at the LL DB
command-line interface so we'll do our
Pio command we saw earlier and print out
bugs and run and we can see that it's
evaluating it's evaluating a lot because
we're creating a lot of bugs but then it
should just fall through our breakpoints
never paused our application it is
taking more time to actually execute
though because it has to run the actions
so we can really see our problem now
because with one tap way more than one
bug was being created and we kept seeing
the contents of this update over and
over again so let's stop and see if we
can see this problem another way so I'll
go back and edit and this time we're
going to add a new breakpoint action so
we can click the plus and let's choose
sound and we'll keep it this default
bottle sound and run again let me turn
out and make sure we can hear this
and now we can hear the problem too so
each time a bug was added to the view
the breakpoint was triggered and our
sound played and you can actually even
add your own custom sounds instead of
the default ones and I've included a
link in the instructor notes if you're
interested so let's stop this one more
time and talk about the remaining
actions that we haven't looked at yet
I'm not going to show examples for each
of the actions because some of them are
outside the scope of this class but
there are additional resources in the
instructor notes that can guide you
through using them so in the breakpoint
editor as we see here we'll add one more
action and here at the top we see Apple
script and what an Apple script action
is going to allow you to do is run an
apple script script when the breakpoint
is hit the next one is capture a GPU
frame and this does exactly what it says
and it can be useful for your debugging
applications using OpenGL or something
like using sprite kit then we have the
log message which will either log a
message to the console or we can
actually speak it back to us but I'll
admit that having the computer speak
back to you can feel a little bit like
Space Odyssey and then the last action
is the shell command and similar to the
Apple script action this allows you to
run a shell script when the breakpoint
is reached and one way this can be
really useful is for an app that might
need to clear the local database records
each time the app is run in the
simulator so instead of doing this
manually you can set a breakpoint and
actually run a script that clears the
local database for you and really there
are endless possibilities with what you
could do with this so I'd encourage you
to experiment with them yourself and
your own projects and if you like
there's another cool thing we can do
here we can actually share our
breakpoints too so if you right-click
any breakpoint in the navigator and you
select shared breakpoint then it will
now show up as shared and the breakpoint
will be included as part of your Xcode
project file and this means that you can
share your Xcode project with anyone
else and they should see the breakpoint
and because the shared breakpoint is
recorded as part of a file then it will
also show up in version control systems
like git</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
