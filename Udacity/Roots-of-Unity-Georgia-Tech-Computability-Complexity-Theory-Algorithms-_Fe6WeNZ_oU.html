positive negative pairs recursively
leads us to a very special set of points
called the roots of unity recall that
our goal is to compute two values of a
polynomial for the price of one by
dividing the terms up into even and odd
powers from here on we'll assume that
the number of points is equal to the
order of the polynomial and that this
number is a power of two in the context
of polynomial multiplication n will be
the power of two that is at least as
great as the number of coefficients of
the product of the two polynomials and
we will pad the coefficients of the
polynomials being multiplied with the
zeros as needed to make their number
equal to n as well in order to be able
to do this computation recursively we
need the sequence X to have the
following properties first they should
all be distinct otherwise our efforts
will be wasted and we won't have enough
points to interpolate back to find the
coefficients we also need the points to
be symmetric or anti-symmetric depending
on how you look at it that is to say we
want the point with index J plus n over
two to be the negative of X sub J and
lastly we want all these properties to
apply to the squares of these numbers so
that we can use this trick recursively
again and again if your polynomials are
over some unusual field then it may make
sense to choose an unusual set of values
for X for most applications however the
coefficients will be integers or reals
or complex numbers and the choice of X
will be the complex roots of unity we
define Omega n to be e to the 2 pi
divided by n and we let XJ be Omega sub
n raised to the J power let's visualize
these points in the complex plane I'll
do this for n equal to 8 all the points
have magnitude 1 so they will be
arranged around the unit circle and the
angle from the positive real axis is
given by the exponent here
that's Omega to the J will be J ents of
the way around the circle let's confirm
that all the desired properties hold
indeed the points are unique
J here is always less than n so there's
no wrap around the circle the symmetric
property holds because adding n over 2
to J has the effect of increasing this
angle by PI or half the circle and so
that's equivalent to negating and
flipping over both axes as well the
recursive property is the hardest to
confirm notice however that for all the
points that have odd powers in the
exponent here squaring these numbers
makes the exponent even thus Omega 3
when squared becomes Omega to the sixth
Omega v when squared will become Omega
to the 10th which wraps around and then
becomes Omega to the second moreover
each of the even powers here is the
square of exactly two other points which
points will just divide the exponent by
2 that gives you one of them for example
Omega to the fourth
well his square root is omega to the two
what's the other point well it's on the
opposite side of the circle of course
the additional n over 2 and the exponent
comes an additional and when we square
it so it's just an extra trip around the
circle and it's the same place for Omega
squared half is omega to the first power
and then the opposite side is omega to
the fifth the result of all this is that
when we square these numbers the odd
powers that will make a go away like so
once we're left with only the even
powers however it doesn't make sense to
express these points in terms of Omega
sub 8 anymore the factors of 2 in the
numerator J and the denominator n cancel
so we can just divide both by 2 and
voila we end up with the 4th roots of
unity instead of the 8th roots and the
same logic applies to all n where N is a
power of 2 and that then shows that all
these key properties that we wanted for
X are true when we choose them to be the
nth roots of unity where N is a power of
2 is worth noting here how few of the
properties of complex numbers were
necessary for the recursion we
in fact there are a number of
theoretical rhythms that use modular
arithmetic and avoid the precision
difficulties associated with working
with complex numbers at the end of the
lesson you'll get a chance to implement
one of those yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
