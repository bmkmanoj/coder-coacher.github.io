begin with the house class will have
three properties and address represented
as an nsstring a bull indicating whether
the house has a hot tub or not and an
int representing the number of bedrooms
in the diagram here I've depicted
objects outlined in orange to write our
house class first we're going to create
a command line project will be making a
lot of these throughout the course so do
take the time to click through these
steps on your own under file click new
and then project instead of an iOS app
this time choose OS X application and
then command line tool and we'll call
this house and make sure objective-c is
the language that's chosen with a
command line tool we can focus on the
code and not worry so much about the UI
to add the files for the house class to
the project control click on the house
folder just like you would any other
Xcode project go down to new file choose
OS 10 as your source and then cocoa
class and again will call the class
house now in the project navigator on
the left you should see the files house
h and has em an objective c every class
is associated with two files a header
file and an implementation file the
header file represents the public
interface and the implementation file
holds method implementations as well as
any properties we'd like to be private
open up the house H file and you'll see
that the house class descends from the
class nsobject all objective-c classes
descend from this class the class has
been declared for us using at sign
interface the name of the class colon
and then the name of the superclass
let's go ahead and declare our
properties for now we'll do that in the
header file which means they'll be
public and accessible outside the class
to do that I type at sign property
non-atomic then the class that the
property belongs to which in this case
is an NS string and asterisks to
indicate that this is a pointer and then
the name of the property address and of
course top it all off with a semicolon
will add number of bedrooms and since
number of bedrooms is a primitive type
and int we don't use a port
and the same goes for the bull has hot
tub</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
