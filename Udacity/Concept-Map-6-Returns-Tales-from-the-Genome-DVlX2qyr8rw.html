here in the center with mutations the
subject of lesson six there are five
main types there are duplications
deletions there are insertions there are
snv's and there are chromosomal
translocations now I knew to put them in
this order not because they were the
right size for the boxes but because of
the arrows pointing to them from down
here we know the mutations can be either
spontaneous or induced and the
spontaneous mutations are from things
like replication errors which are causes
of duplications insertions deletions and
single nucleotide variations or snv's
induced mutations are from things like
x-rays and UV rays UV rays can typically
cause snv's whereas x rays cause
double-stranded DNA breaks and
eventually chromosomal translocations
mutations themselves are just changes in
the non-coding DNA or the coding DNA for
refreshers on these topics you can
review concepts of coding DNA in lesson
3 and non-coding DNA in Lesson four
mutations in the coding region of DNA
can lead to four different kinds of
mutations silent mutations which don't
change the amino acids missense
mutations which change the amino acid
nonsense mutations which change an amino
acid to a stop codon or frameshift
mutations which completely throw off the
entire reading frame of a ribosome so
that you change many amino acids now
germ cells also undergo meiosis which we
learned about in the last lesson and an
abnormal division at meiosis can cause
aneuploidy which is the addition or loss
of chromosomes again you learned about
chromosomes in lesson 2 now the
mutations in germ cells are the major
source for new alleles in the following
generations we've learned about alleles
in lessons 34 and really five as well
and alleles cause traits which we've
sort of generally talked about in lesson
1 and more specifically in lesson 5 but
alleles and traits have changes in
population frequency
due to natural selection and random
selection hopefully this concept map
helps organize your thoughts on the
lesson so keep it handy because you
might want to come back to it as we keep
moving along in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
