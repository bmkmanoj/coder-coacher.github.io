to us because not a day goes by that we
don't have to implement some type of
problem solving strategy every task we
do that we don't necessarily know how to
do forces us to solve a problem there
are many strategies to solve different
kinds of problems for example basic
mathematical problems use algorithms and
algorithms are step by step formulas or
procedures used to solve a problem for
example use an algorithm when you're
trying to do long division these
step-by-step procedures work really well
when there's a clear yet unknown
solution to a problem these kinds of
problems are called convergent problems
they have a known solution and your
thinking has to converge or narrow down
on the correct solution other problems
have no known solution or many different
solutions these are called divergent
problems this requires thinking that
broadens and diverges to come up with a
possible solution now for these kinds of
problems a good strategy to use is in
sight for the Eureka strategy this
involves lots of thinking you might be
stumped for a little while put the
problem aside for a little while but
then all of a sudden the solution will
just hit you the problem - this is it
can't be taught like algorithms can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
