structures let's put the data structures
to work let's first look at what happens
on a page fault on a page fault the node
first converts the virtual address to a
UID and once it converts it to the UID
it goes to the page ownership directory
and as I mentioned the page ownership
directory is something that I can trust
it'll tell me given this UID I'll tell
you who the owner of this pages and you
go to him
because he has the GCD data structure
for this so no day finds out the
identity of the owner for this UID and
that happens to be note B so it sends
the UID over to node B and node B
because it is the owner for this UID it
looks up its GCD data structure and says
oh the PFD that can translate this UID
which actually represents this virtual
address is actually contained in this
particular node node C so that's the
content of this data structure given a
UID what is the node ID that contains
the PFD remember that PFD is the
equivalent of a page table in a normal
system and therefore that's the node
that I want to send this UID to so that
we can do the translation for this
virtual address so node B sends the UID
over the node C and node C contains the
PFD that has the mapping between the UID
and the page frame number that is backed
by this node for this UID retrieves the
page it's a hit sends it over to node a
node a is happy it can then map this
virtual address into its internal
structure and the page fault service is
complete and it can resume the process
that was blocked for this page 1 so you
can see that potentially when a page
fault happens I can have three levels of
network communication of course the
first lookup of the PID is local to my
node because this PID data structure is
replicated on every node so from the UID
I
find the owner for the zoo ID but then I
have to send a network message over to
the node that contains the GCD for this
UID and then he'll then send it to the
node that has this page so that that
page can come back now this network
communication I'm willing to tolerate
because it is equivalent to performing
the role of what the disk could have
done and maybe it is much better than
going to a disk in order to get the
missing page so this is happening only
on a page fault and since it is on a
page fault
listen network communication is ok but
this is an extra network communication
fortunately the common case is a page
fault is servicing the request of a
local process unknown a and so the page
is a non shared page and it is a non
shared page most likely the UID space
that corresponds to the missing page is
also managed by this node or in other
words both the P or D and the GCD
corresponding to a particular UID is
mostly on this node itself and this is
true for non shared pages and so a and B
are exactly the same node so there is no
network communication to go from the
pod2g CD to find out the PFD so
hopefully the only network communication
that happens on every page fault is a
network communication to go to this node
that is serving the role of a disc and
get the page from him that's ok to incur
because it probably is much lesser than
going to the disk in order to do the
page access so the page fault service
for the common case is going to be
pretty quick so the important message I
want you to get out of this is that even
though these distributed data structures
may make it look like you're gonna have
a lot of network communication important
thing to note is that it happens only
when there is a page fault and since
most of the page faults the common case
is going to be non shared pages the data
structure p OD and GCD are probably
co-resident
on the same node so even though I've
shown two different nodes here a and B
may be exactly this
same node and so looking up the PFD that
currently is backing this particular UID
is going to be local to this node and so
we can directly go to the node that
contains the PFD and make the page fault
service pretty quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
