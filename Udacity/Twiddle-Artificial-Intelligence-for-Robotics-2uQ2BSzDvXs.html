a set of parameters to do so our
function run must return a goodness this
goodness managed by the average cross
tag error so I want you to implement
twiddle so as to minimize the average
cross stick arrow if that's the case
then the output of run depends on the
three parameters so here's what Twitter
works build a parameter vector of our
three target parameters and initialize
it with zero also with the vector of
potential changes that you want to probe
and initialize them for now with one
then you can run aa command run with our
parameters and whatever it outputs is
our best error so far so now we wish to
modify P as to make the error smaller
and that's where the riddle comes in
it's a really smart algorithm I believe
we sequentially go through these
parameters obviously you shouldn't write
three you should write Len of P and
first we try to increase P by our
probing value compute a new error for
this new modified P if this new error is
better than our best error then we do
two things
first we set best error to error and we
even modify our DP to a slightly larger
value by multiplying advanced with one
point one otherwise we try the other way
so we subtract DP from P and we have to
do it twice now because we edited before
and if it really the same thing again is
over here I'm not going to write it out
but we check whether the error is better
than our best error and then we retain
it and we multiply DP up by one point
one but if both of those fail this one
over here and this one over here we set
back pi/2 the original value and we
decrease our problem thing over here say
we're multiplying it with 0.9 let's the
core of twiddle and what it really does
is it for each coordinate in isolation
moves our parameter up or down a little
bit by this value over here if it then
finds a better solution it retains it
and it even currents the probing
interval but if it fails to find a
better solution it goes back to the
original and
decreases our propping interval we do
this entire thing so long as the some of
the DPS is larger than the threshold so
somewhere in here we say while some of
DP it's louder than 0.00001 it's hard to
read but I hope you could follow it
this is twiddle so let me put this into
pictures we have three parameters zero
zero zero and then in the first
iteration we bump one of the parameters
up and see if it improves the error if
that's the case we retain it let me go
to the second parameter we bump it up it
might not work we bump it down maybe
retain that one and so on and now as we
keep bumping up we might find that
neither bumping up no bumping down helps
so we do instead as you retain the
original solution but make our probing
interval smaller than before by a factor
of 0.9 in doing so we can zoom in more
and more into a detail parameter until
it finally converges it's a local hair
climber but it happens to be really
really efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
