through the genome and I'm looking for a
single gene that affects some really
complex traits like I know depression or
intelligence maybe even schizophrenia
well Lauren although we learned in the
last lesson that there are traits that
can be influenced or even completely
controlled by changes in individual
genes most traits don't work like that
in fact I think it's time that we turned
our focus to understanding the genetic
basis for complex traits while some
traits like the ones we talked about in
the last lesson can be explained by the
alteration of a single gene most traits
are actually complex you have over
20,000 genes in your genome and they're
all working together your environment
matters to what you eat where you live
your daily activities most of the traits
that you mentioned learn are actually
complex and influenced by both genetic
and environmental factors so for us to
understand how both these sides
contribute to a trait we're gonna have
to come up with some unique tools we're
gonna jump right in in just a second
with the trait that affects people all
over the world risk for breast cancer
also don't forget about your concept map
I want you to print this out and fill
out the blanks as we go along and as
always you'll have a chance to see what
you learned from this at the end of the
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
