genetic algorithms I mean there's lots
of TWiki things that you need to do to
get this to work very effectively you
have some choice about how to represent
the inputs and you have some choice
about how you can do your selection and
your fit defining your fitness function
but at a generic level this is this it's
it's a useful thing some people call
genetic algorithms the second best
solution to any given problem
mmm so it's a good thing to have in your
toolbox but I think that's that's really
it that's all I wanted to say about
randomized optimization so what have we
learned well we learned about randomized
optimization period Dada that there is a
notion of optimization in the first
place so we talked about optimization in
general and then we what was the
randomized part well we take random
steps or we start off in random places
or we do random kind well actually
really that's really it you take random
steps you start off in random places and
it's a way to overcome when you can't
take a natural gradient step that's
right
so did we talk and we talked about some
particular randomization or sorry
randomized optimization algorithms let's
see was randomized hill climbing and we
had two flavors of that right we did
simulated annealing and we did and don't
forget that we talked a little bit about
how this all connects back up with
learning because in many cases
we're searching some parameter space to
find a good classifier a good regression
function a later in this particular sub
unit we're gonna be talking about
finding good clusterings and so this
notion of finding something that's good
finding a way to be optimal is pervasive
throughout machine learning make sense
well well if we're trying to remember
all these other things we learned we
also learned that AI researchers like
analogies those simulated annealing
engineering algorithms are analogies and
they don't just like analogies they like
taking analogies and pushing them until
they break indeed actually hill climbing
is analogy to yeah actually every single
thing that we did is an analogy to
something okay that's good the other
thing that we learned which i think is
important is that there's no way to talk
about cross crossover without getting a
bunch of people in the studio to giggle
yeah genetic algorithms make people
blush okay that's pretty good but
Michael you know I'm looking at all this
and now that you put all these words
together on one slide I have two
observations I want to make that I that
are kind of bothering me so one is I'm
looking at hill climbing that makes
sense so climbing restarts makes sense I
mean the only makes sense Janiero
but you know what they don't really
remember a lot so what do I mean by that
so you do all this hill climbing and you
go eight billion steps and then what
happens you end up with a point you do
simulated annealing you do all this
fancy stuff with slowly changing your
temperature and creating swords with
blacksmiths and all that other stuff you
talked about and in the end at every
step the only thing you remember is
where you are maybe where you last were
and with genetic algorithms a little
more complicated than that because you
keep a population but really you're just
keeping track of where you are not where
you've been so in some sense the only
difference between the one millionth
iteration and the first iteration is
that you might be at a better point and
it just feels like if you're gonna go
through all this trouble of going
through what is some complicated space
that hopefully has some structure there
should be some way to communicate
information about that structure as you
go along and I just that's sort of
bothers that's one thing the second
thing is what I really liked about
simulated annealing other than you know
the analogy and hearing you talk about
strong swords is that it came out at the
end with a really nice result which is
this Boltzmann distribution that there's
some probability distribution that we
can understand that is actually trying
to model so here are my questions then
it's a long way of asking the real
simple question is there something out
there something we can say more about
not just keeping track of points but
keeping track of structure and
information and is there some way that
we can take advantage of the fact that
all of these things are somehow tracking
probability distributions just by their
very nature of being randomized that's
that's outstanding yes very good very
good questions it is true that these are
all kind of amnesiac right they kind of
just wander around and forget everything
about what they learned they don't
really learn about the optimization
space itself and use that information to
be more effective there are some other
algorithms that these are these are the
kind of
simplest algorithms but you can
recombine these ideas you know sort of
crossover style to get other more
powerful algorithms there's one that's
called taboo search that specifically
tries to remember where you've been and
you're supposed to avoid it or there's
become taboo regions to stay with the
idea that you should stay away from
regions where you've already done a lot
of evaluation so you cover the space
better and then there's other methods
that are have been popular for a while
that are gaining in popularity where
they explicitly model the probability
distribution over where good solutions
might be so it might be worth actually
talking a little bit more about that
okay so go ahead well so I kind of added
time maybe maybe you could look into
this I can give you some references and
maybe you can report back I know you'll
learn you'll learn very well by doing
that yes sir all right we'll see you
then then okay I'll see you then then -
bye Michael
