for each one tell me whether or not it's
infinite
okay linear separators there see me like
half planes or lines or you know
depending upon the dimensionality there
are of course an infinite number of
these things there's an infinite number
of lines so check that one alright so y
equals MX plus B and I can put any real
number for em any real number for B into
the number of those in fact there's not
just an infinite number of those there's
like Alif one we should talk about that
one day artificial neural networks are
exactly the same thing they have weights
those weights of real numbers so even if
there were only one weight there's an
infinite number of real numbers to
choose from so that's also implement
decision trees with discrete inputs I
have two answers for you here Michael Oh
answer one is of course it's finite
I assume there's only a finite number of
features the other answer is it could be
infinite if I'm allowed to reuse
features over and over again even if
they're useless to reuse but that's in
sort of insane and silly and no one
would ever do that so I think the right
answer is to leave it unchecked okay
and then finally decision trees with
continuous inputs well that's the same
we had a long conversation about this
when we talked about decision trees we
can keep asking questions about them so
if there's a there's sort of an infinite
number of questions you can ask I can
say well is this feature greater than
0.1 and then ask if it's greater than
point one one then is equated to 0.111
then point one so that is also infinite
so basically everything we've talked
about or nearly everything we've talked
about actually doesn't fit the analysis
that we talked about last time
what about kN yeah so kanan is a little
bit of a mess I think you and I maybe
don't completely agree on this one so I
think of KN the classifier that comes
out of a cannon is defined by the set of
data points that are the the neighbors
mm-hm and there's an infinite number of
ways of laying out those points so
there's an infinite number of different
can and based classifiers that you could
have but you have a counter-argument to
that right which is that if you assume
the training set is fixed and that's
just a part of the parameters of the
hypothesis space then it is an infinite
there's in fact only one it all just
depends upon q and it always gives you
the same answer
no matter what so I think the hypothesis
space you could argue is finite it all
depends upon what it is you're taking as
part of the hypothesis space and what it
is you aren't taking as far that's right
sort of whether the data is is built-in
or not but but it you know it strikes me
that these other methods are also
similar in that if you bake in the data
then there's just the one answer but
yeah it's cannon is weird right because
it's it's sometimes called nonparametric
right which sounds like it should mean
it has no parameters but what it
actually means is it has an infinite
number of parameters right well I don't
think that's true about baking things in
so for example if I give you a set of
data there's still an infinite number of
neural networks that are consistent with
that data there's a whole bunch of
decision trees that are consistent with
that data so you don't always get the
same answer every time certainly with
neural networks you know because you
start in a random place but it but if
you write if you're bacon the algorithm
and the data and I think and KNN that's
exactly what you're doing but III agree
that we can agree to not agree agreed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
