should get it if you understand
assignment the answers are all of them
except this one and we'll go over each
one one by one I've initialized their
values to represent colors but they can
be any integer as described in the
question so the first line of code
states that a refers to what X refers to
so let's change that the second says
that a now refers to what a refers to
plus one so now a refers to a new number
which is the red triangle plus one at
the end of these two statements X still
equals what it was originally and that
is the red triangle a and X as described
refer to initial values the first code
first line of code since that a refers
to what X refers to so as we did in the
last problem we result in that a and X
both refer to the red triangle now X
refers to what a refers to well as you
can see a also refers to the red
triangle so the result of this is that X
still refers to the red triangle and
since that's what it was initially the
value of x has not yet changed in this
choice the value of x changes let's show
you why the first line of code says that
X now refers to what it used to refer to
plus one so we're going to create a new
value that is the red triangle plus one
and change what X points do the second
line says X should now refer to what X
refers to well it doesn't change what
it's referring to now which is the red
triangle plus one the end result is that
X does not refer to the red triangle any
longer which is why it's not the correct
choice the first choice may be a little
bit of Python that you haven't seen
before what this says is a should equal
X and X should equal a the end result is
that X in a swap so let's see what that
looks like and they'll draw this all the
way around here
X and I have swapped values X now refers
to the green triangle na
the red triangle the second line of code
is exactly the same as the first it's
going to swap them again and if you swap
two things twice you get what you had
before so since X refers to the red
triangle still it's a correct choice in
the last choice we have a third variable
X as e we initialize Z to the value of x
which is the red triangle we then assign
a to what Z refers to which is also the
red triangle and lastly we set X to the
value of a a refers to the red triangle
so X also refers to the red triangle the
end result is the value of x hasn't
changed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
