follows you take some location on a
surface given that location use some
function to change the surface
attributes at that location for example
you could change the color shininess
transparency normal or even the surface
hider shape that's all there is to it
what the lessons ahead will cover is
what sorts of functions are used and
some of the popular ways to modify the
surface let's take a concrete example
well maybe not concrete let's make it
would in fact let's make it the most
popular object in video gaming the crate
I looked it up once I claims there are
seven hundred and forty odd video games
with crates in them and Counting you
have some objects such as a box you'd
like to make it look like a crate the
most common way to apply a texture to a
surface is to use an image and glue it
on sort of like wallpaper what you'd
like to get out is this the crate
texture applied to the box in three j/s
this is amazingly simple here's the code
snippet that does it the first line
loads the texture the second line
applies this texture tool material done
maybe I should just wrap up this unit
with that for the simple case everything
just worked three J s has a reasonable
default for applying a square texture to
square box sides that said I should give
you fair warning about loading textures
there are security concerns enforced
with WebGL the short version is that you
can't normally load some texture from
another site into your program your
program and the texture needs to be in
the same local space in order to run see
