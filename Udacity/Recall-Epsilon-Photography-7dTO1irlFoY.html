photography something by now you should
be familiar with because you did an
assignment of trying to capture a
sequence of pictures epsilon photography
aims to capture M sequence of different
pictures where basically we're changing
one parameter by just a minut amount
very small epsilon amount to capture the
variations in a scene and then of course
fuse the different pictures together to
create a richer representation that
captures a scene in variety of
conditions and that could be used to
synthesize novel pictures taking
multiple captures of the single scene or
the single image to generate a newer
image we looked at variety of examples
we can actually change the exposure and
if you recall this was an example of
what we did to create HDR images so by
fusing the three different exposures of
this image we were able to generate an
HDR image another example could be the
viewpoint right where we change the
camera parameters by changing the view
point and then fusing them together we
can create a panorama many other
examples of this exist here is an
example of being able to capture a focus
stack and then being able to generate a
new image that basically has no focus
variations or of course sometimes we can
then controllably change the variation
but in epsilon photography the goal was
to be able to capture all of those
images and in fact actually capture
multiple images then those multiple
images could be then used to generate a
newer image or perhaps even a
controllable image that could be
generated on the fly now remember our
pipeline for computational photography
we want to capture a 3d scene which is
illuminated the optics focused the light
onto a sensor we can process the images
to generate a new output display for the
user if you recall this from our earlier
lectures basically this was kind of
showcased in the following manner
we had a 3d scene we can illuminate the
scene with a computer-controlled
projector a controllable light source
and of course we can control the light
source entirely or also the parts of it
by creating some sort of a modular
controllable aperture remember again we
looked at this example in the previous
lecture when we talked about projector
camera systems
another option also was to create a
camera and of course we would know how
to do cameras we learned all there is to
about the optics and the pinhole aspect
of a camera but we can also start
thinking that now I can put some sort of
a controllable aperture in front of this
that not only controls the amount of
light that goes in but also which parts
of the sensor would be lit based on
which parts I either restrict or open so
that's the basic pipeline that we've
looked at we've looked at projector
camera systems that have looked at how
the illumination source with a camera
can be used to extract and generate
newer types of images we have looked at
the camera but we haven't actually
looked at how to control different
aspects of it in this way except in a
few examples like the dual photography
example that we've looked at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
