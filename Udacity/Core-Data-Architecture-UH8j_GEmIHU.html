is essentially a framework to help you
manage the model part of your app you
recall that the model-view-controller
design pattern splits your app up into
three parts and that the model part is
what deals with the important tangible
essential pieces of the app coordinator
gives us a way to manage these important
pieces and gives them the title managed
objects
what does managing these objects entail
it includes everything from changing
them tracking them for assisting them to
managing their relationships and more
let's look at an overview of the core
data architecture to see how this works
there are several main components to
become familiar with and we've already
somewhat touched on two of them the
managed object model also referred to as
the data model is basically the physical
representation of the model we just
spoke of it exists in Xcode as a special
kind of graphic file similar to a
storyboard file but with different
purpose and capabilities the managed
object model is what is used to specify
the classes and relationships that will
be managed within your app and is
therefore also what the tables and rows
of your apps SQLite database will be
generated from much like how interface
builder automates a storyboard file core
data automates a managed object model
file managed objects are those important
fundamental pieces we spoke of earlier a
character in a game app and event in a
calendar app there what's specified by
your object model and what are actually
responsible for most of core data's
magic C while they look like regular
Swift objects they have a substantial
twist unlike any object we've seen thus
far they save the contents of their
properties to a database file core data
actually hides this complexity from us
so we don't have to worry about it which
is why we refer to it as magic every
single object of your model will be a
subclass of NS managed object the
managed object context or the context is
where most of the action happens this
object an instance of ns-managed object
context is helpful to imagine as a place
the context is where your managed
objects live until they are saved to
disk and where nearly every coordinate
operation takes place want to create an
object you need to context in which it
will live want to delete an object ask
the context want to save again ask the
context to find out who and what is
living inside the context a fetch
request is needed a fetch request is a
sir
the context for a certain type of
managed object it can specify the type
of managed object a filter and now the
resulting objects should be sorted all
of the pieces of core data that we've
discussed thus far have belonged to the
model layer this next piece the fetch
results controller works in part to
control how the data from the fetch
request will be displayed in a view and
is thus part of the controller layer a
fetch results controller takes a fetch
request runs the search and helps
display the results in a table view or
with a little extra work on our part a
collection view the most basic task a
controller must perform is to keep the
model and view in sync an NS fetch
results controller does precisely this
if the objects returned by the fetch
request ever change the fetch results
controller automatically updates the
table view at the lower level
coordinator relies on what's called
persistent stores or stores for short
stores like the name implies are where
manage objects actually gets stored when
saved to disk they can be thought of as
data based data files and can exist in
several types namely XML binary format
and SQLite the latter being the most
common and also the one we'll be using
note that you can have more than one
store or type of store in a given app
also at the lower level is the last
piece we're going to talk about for now
the persistent store coordinator this
object allows you to have multiple
stores and keep the rest of your app
from knowing it but for the most part
persistence stores and their
coordinators are not something you have
to worry about too much these classes
when put together make up what's called
the core data stack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
