works when we use SSH and here I'm using
SSH to log into udacity.com
and what I see is a message that says
the authenticity of the host can be
established that means I don't already
know a public key for the host and we
can see because I don't already have a
public key for udacity.com that it
cannot establish the authenticity of the
host it's showing me this fingerprint
which is a way for it to be more easy
for a human to view the key rather than
seeing all the bits in the key if I was
very paranoid and careful what I would
do is call up an administrator that I
trust at udacity and say is this the
fingerprint for our public key if I'm
less paranoid or more impatient well
then I could connect and once I connect
that public key is going to be stored
it's added to the list of hosts that I
have I'm not going to actually continue
connecting but now I have a secure
channel encrypted with some keith's
that's been agreed to
using this SSH protocol to send my
password to the Udacity House knowing
that it couldn't be intercepted but this
only has value if I really knew that
this was the public key otherwise that
could be talking to anyone what's
happened as a result of this is now that
that key has been added to my collection
of keys so now if I look in the file SSH
known hosts I'll see that I have
udacity.com here and what's been stored
is the IP address I was talking to as
well as this is the public key that's
stored for audacity comm if I try again
you'll see that it does connect it has a
secure channel now and it's verified it
by checking that the public key that the
server sent match this one what's more
fun is if I modify this file and I'm
going to make a little change to the
public key let's change that four to
three now let's try connecting again
what happens now is we get a very large
yelling message with lots of capital
letters saying that the host
identification has changed that the host
I'm trying to connect to send back a
public key that's different from the one
that I've stored it means that someone
could be doing something very nasty in
this case it means that I just modified
the key file and they're talking about
possibly being eavesdropped on it's
really not the case that it would be is
dropping it must be an attack in the
middle
so this is a bit of a poor wording in
the error message it's also possible the
key change or something else happened
and so they don't allow you to continue
with the connection at this point you
could modify the file to create a new
key but it's worried enough that
something has gone wrong that it won't
let you connect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
