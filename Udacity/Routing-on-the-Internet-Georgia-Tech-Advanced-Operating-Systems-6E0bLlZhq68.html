packets on the internet typically what
happens is at the source node you create
a network packet and go through the
layers of software stack on the sending
node and send the packet out on the
network and this network packet has a
desired destination and of course it has
to go through a whole number of
intermediate routers in order to get to
its eventual destination and the routers
on the internet that are intermediate
between the source and the destination
they don't inspect the packet for the
contents or anything like that all that
they're doing is when a packet comes in
they're looking at the destination known
for that packet and figuring out what is
the next hop that I have to send the
packet to so each router is making their
determination of the next hop for the
packet and it makes the determination by
doing a table lookup so every lauder has
a routing table and the routing table is
selling given a particular destination
what is the next hop and that's how the
packet flows from source to destination
through a whole bunch of intermediate
routers and finally gets to the
destination so in other words the
routers end route to the destination
from the source are simply forwarding
packets that is the nodes are passive
and they're just doing a table lookup in
order to figure out what is the next hop
that I have to send this packet to now
what does it mean to make the nodes
active what we mean by making the node
active is that the next hop for sending
this packet towards the destination is
not simply a table lookup but it is
actually determined by the router
executing code that is actively as
opposed to doing just a passive table
lookup so in other words the packet in
addition to the payload that is intended
for the destination also carries code
with it and the code is being executed
by the router in order to make a
determination as to what to do with this
packet in terms of routing it towards
the desired destination this sounds
really clever because it can provide
customized service for network flows
that are going through the network and
every network can have its own way
of choosing what may be the desired
route in terms of going from source to
destination and so in other words we are
saying well this is an opportunity to
virtualize the traffic flow for my
network traffic independent of other
network flows this should be very
familiar to you all because we've been
talking about customizing operating
system services in the spin operating
system and the exokernel and so on but
of course the problem that we are
talking about here much much harder
because the network is wide open our
network traffic flow is going through
the public Internet infrastructure and
we are talking about specializing the
network flow for every network flow
independent of others and lots of
challenges to this vision of active
network in particular how can we write
such code that we can distribute and
send it over the wire so that the
audience can execute it and who can
write such code and how can we be sure
that the injected code does not break
the network or in other words for a
particular network flow there is a code
that is going to be sent around how do
we make sure that that is not going to
in some ways timing other network flows
these are things that we have to worry
about in sort of opening up the router
and saying that we're going to take
Network flow specific decisions in each
of the routers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
