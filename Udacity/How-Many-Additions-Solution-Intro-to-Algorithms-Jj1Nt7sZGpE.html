that hold in the program as Russian 20
comma 7 execute and as you can see there
are two times when the value of y is
added into Z once when X is 5 20 and 0
get added in and another time when X is
128 at 112 get added in and we get our
correct answer of 140 interesting thing
to note here is let's take a look at the
sequence of X values we have one that's
even another one that's even one that's
odd
another one that's even well that's odd
and another one that's even and let's
think for a second about the binary
representation of the number 20 which
looks like this 1 2 4 plus 8 16 4 plus
16 is 20 so this is the binary
representation of 20 and you can see
that these zeros line up the 1 the 0 the
1 the 0 each time it's odd we do in
addition so essentially actually exactly
each time there's a 1 in the binary
representation of this first value
there's going to be an addition that
takes place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
