bit and see some numbers that can be
written as rational powers of the base
we're also going to pick a new base to
work with log base 10 which is one of
the most convenient basis to use because
there's a button on calculators for it
in fact i'd like you to use your
calculator to do these problems you'll
probably be able to figure out a few of
them on your own without the calculator
but it makes sense to use it just to
make sure the buttons work the way that
you think they do in fact on many
calculators and sometimes in text books
and other places instead of seeing log
base 10 you'll just see the word log
without a base written this usually
means log base 10 in fact let's look and
see what my calculator has on it sure
enough there's just a button that says
log with no base this is log base 10 so
let's say I want to find log base 10 of
some number well 11 is my favorite
number as you know so let's try that you
can see I press log and then enter the
number that I'm looking for close the
parentheses for good measure and press
equals and there we go a long decimal
i'm going to try another just to humor
myself how about log base 10 of 2314 why
not there we go so here are a bunch of
log base 10 problems for you to figure
out I'll demo one on the calculator just
to make sure that it's working like we
think it's going to define log base 10
of one if I didn't want to use a
calculator I would rewrite one as 10 to
the 0 so that means this should give us
0 let's make sure our calculators
working the way we think it is so to
find log base 10 of 10 press log and
then one close the parenthesis and sure
enough we got 0 great now you get plenty
of chances to try this out on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
