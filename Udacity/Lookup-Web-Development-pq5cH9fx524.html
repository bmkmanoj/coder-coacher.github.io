index that that makes our index we just
wrote this together let's let's use this
let's use this new index function so
first thing I want to do is actually run
the function and store that somewhere so
we'll store that in a variable called
link index equals build link index now
this isn't the the best Python code
normally we wouldn't use global
variables like this but this is fine for
this example one one time we're going to
build this link index and now I'd like
to update our link by ID function to use
our new index
okay so I've improved this function to
instead of iterating over the entire
list of links to just look up the link
ID in the index and let's give this a
test
okay so let's call this function linked
by ID on linked 24 we've done that a
couple times I click run huh and we see
our link ID equals 24 now what happens
if we run this on a link that doesn't
exist barf or our program died because
we tried to look up in a Python hash
table an ID that doesn't exist or a key
that doesn't exist so there's an easier
way to fix that in Python I'll show you
how to do that instead of using these
braces we can use the function called
get which python hash tables have and
what this does is it checks to see if
this keys in the hash table and if it is
that's what this function returns
otherwise it returns none so let's give
our function a test again by running
this okay now we return none very cool
that's what we expected and let's just
make sure that our function is still
working the way it worked before by
sending in a link that we know exists in
this case I'll do for here we go
okay so we see link ID 4 so now we have
this function linked by ID that uses our
index so if we had a bunch of links all
we'd have to do is build this index once
and then we don't have to scan over it
every time we do a lookup every time we
do a query instead we can just hit the
index ok now there's one last function
I'd like you to add what I'd like you to
do is implement this new function called
add new link and it's going to take a
link it's going to take an instance of
link as a parameter and then it needs to
both add the link to our
our database which is this you know the
list object we've been working with
links and it's also going to add the
links ID to the list the link index go
ahead and implement this function now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
