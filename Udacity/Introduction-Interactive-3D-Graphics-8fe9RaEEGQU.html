about something I love computer graphics
what's not to like in this area of
computer science you will write code to
create cool pictures I've been
programming computers since 1974 and
have been working on computer graphics
since 1983 with computer chips
constantly getting faster and with
graphics accelerators in particular
evolving at a rapid clip the rules about
what's possible change time and time
again there are always new things to
learn I guarantee that the computer
language isn't hardware we will use will
change the good news for you as a
student is that I'm going to focus on
what makes computer graphics
tick the underlying principles I'll
cover here will give you a firm
foundation in the field I'm particularly
excited that I'll be able to teach this
class now a few years ago such a class
would have been extremely difficult with
the rise of a web technology called
WebGL you can simply click on a link and
immediately run a 3d demo yourself in
some trivial sense everything you see on
your computer screen can be called
computer graphics word processors videos
such as this one of me paint programs
and much else result in images on your
monitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
