work up into chunks in this case tiles
we have a continuum between tiny tiles
lots of them and fewer tiles where each
tile is sized to the maximum that can
fit in a single thread block and in this
particular problem bigger tiles means
less memory bandwidth this is good
generally then you want to make your
tiles as big as can fit into a single
thread block because that minimizes
overall memory bandwidth but note the
following two caveats one you need to
have at least as many thread blocks as
you have SMS in your GPU because
otherwise you'll have SM sitting idle
definitely you want to make sure you
fill the machine with enough work to
keep all the SMS busy even if you have
to move a little bit this way on the
continuum and size your tiles just a
little bit smaller too if you're sitting
at the right end of this continuum it's
best for overall memory bandwidth but
often it turns out that you'd actually
prefer to move just maybe one tick to
the left this allows a small number say
two blocks to both be resident at a time
and that potentially gives better
latency hiding characteristics because
you have more warps that may be in
flight at the same time from slightly
different pieces of the program it's
certainly something that you would want
to tune carefully if you needed the very
fastest possible implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
