pattern that's very common when
designing classes we'll say that the
class has a property if it has a value
that one can simply get and set look at
a person a person has a name that's a
private instance variable so we'll have
a getter that returns the name and here
we have a setter that he can use to set
the name to a new name in case the
person for whatever reason is unhappy
with their previous one it's very very
common to have this pattern instance
variable getter setter there's some
variations sometimes you do some error
checking in the setter here we check
that the new name is not the empty
string because no one's name should be
the empty string or maybe in a
particular application it just shouldn't
be allowed to change the name and in
that case there wouldn't be a setter
this is a read-only property in this
example where we just have the instance
variable and the corresponding getter
now properties meaning private instance
variables with getters and maybe setters
are very common but that doesn't mean
that you should make every instance
variable a property with a getter and
setter only use two getters when there
is a need for the user of the class to
read the instance variable and only
supply a setter when there is a need for
the user to modify it many instance
variables do not have getters and
setters
well let's practice that with yet
another variation of the core class this
core class has a number of instance
variables and I'd like you to look it
over and add getters and setters for
those where it's appropriate and not add
them for those words not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
