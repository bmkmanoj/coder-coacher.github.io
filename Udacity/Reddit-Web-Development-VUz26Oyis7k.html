referring to Reddit you know we've used
it as database examples I'd kind of
refer to system architecture things we
did and and I've referred to mistakes
I've made over the years on reddit I'm
gonna kind of take from the top how we
built reddit and how we grew it over the
years and then I'm gonna talk with Neil
who's the current lead engineer of
reddit and he's going to talk about how
they've taken over since I've left which
was a couple years ago is now and
continued to grow the site as it's grown
tremendously
so we started in June of 2005 me and my
co-founder my college roommate his
name's Alexis Ohanian I was the engineer
and alexis was our kind of everything
else guy he paid the rent he did the
business guy stuff he did the marketing
things he was my sounding board for
future ideas he did design work for
reddit him and I basically lived reddit
for the first two years the two of us
when we started the first version of
reddit was written in Lisp which is a
actually very old programming language
one of the first ones I think it was
originally invented in the fifties it's
still one of the most powerful languages
it's very fun to develop in one of the
other professors here at Udacity Peter
Norvig is one of the world's Lisp
experts and a couple of his books are
extremely good at not a topic of list
it's more popular I would say at
universities than it is in the real
world it's really neat to work in during
this time we had very little traffic but
everything was unless our handlers as
you would expect about HTML was all
generated by Lisp our CSS was all
generated by less JavaScript Lisp is a
language that lends itself to generating
other languages and other pieces of code
really really nicely I'm not going to
get into the details of it but Lisp was
all we had we had Lisp plus Postgres we
didn't have any memcached at the time I
just stored everything in an in-memory
hash table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
