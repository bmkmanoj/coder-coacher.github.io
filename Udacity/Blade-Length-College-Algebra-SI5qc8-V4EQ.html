have which we can also write an interval
notation of course seems like
considering of the same number almost
written twice just one of it with a
negative sign there should be some sort
of simpler way to write this it's not
exactly redundant now but it seems a
little bit repetitive but we really know
is that we want the difference between
zero so we want the distance it takes on
a number line to get from zero out to
either end of the tolerance it's just
point three either in the positive
direction or the negative direction when
we can denote this is by using what's
called absolute value signs we can think
of the absolute value of a number as the
distance between that number and 0 this
distance is absolute in that it ignores
direction we can see the accounting from
positive point three back to zero takes
us Oh point one point two point three
but the same is true of negative point
three point one point two point three so
positive point 3 and negative point 3
have the same absolute value because of
the same distance from zero on the
number line now that you have an idea of
what absolute value is can you tell me
what the absolute value of negative 9 is
and with the absolute value of four and
a half is this number line is here just
for you to have a visual in case you
feel like counting on something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
