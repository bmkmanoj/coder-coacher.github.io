the Play Store and find an app you don't
like and then we're gonna deconstruct
why now you may already have an app in
mind something you've used and don't
like you can use that if you do go to
the Play Store you may have to look a
bit sometimes Play Store will tend to
feature the higher rated apps of course
so you may have to dig a little deeper
after you find an app that you don't
like so much
you should make two flows in Prezi in
the first flow you will describe or
depict I should say one flow through the
app as it currently exists I say one
flow because complex apps can have a
complicated hierarchy of potential flows
after you do this you're gonna think at
a high level though what about this flow
is making you unhappy and then you're
gonna fix it now not every app that just
pleases you is wrong because of its high
level flow you may just not be the
Intendant audience but hopefully you can
find one where this is the case and
focus on that once you've made your two
flows you're going to post the form you
can either find the thread in the
instructor notes below or in the
discussion section off to the side the
goal of this whole question is to get
you thinking and speaking like a
designer and making high-level
improvements to products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
