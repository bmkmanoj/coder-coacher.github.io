each of the composite functions for
every pair here would be then we can
answer whether or not they're the same
for this first pair we have f of x
equals x squared and g of x equals x
plus 1 that means that f composed with G
would give us X plus 1 squared but if we
have G composed with F then instead we
get x squared plus 1 these are not the
same so let's check know for the next
one we have f of x equals x plus 1 and G
of x equals x plus 2 and in this case
both of our compositions are the same it
doesn't matter whether we add two and
then one or one and then to 2x in both
cases we end up with X plus three so
let's check yes for this one interesting
and now for the fun part is putting on
your left shoe and then putting on your
right shoe going to give you the same
outcome as putting on your right shoe
and then putting on your left shoe well
in both cases you're going to end up
with both shoes on your feet so yes f of
g and g of f are the same now we have
one function as putting on your shoes
and the other as putting on your socks
so it's putting on your socks and then
your shoes the same is putting on your
shoes and then your socks well mon case
we end up with a pretty normal situation
socks underneath shoes in the other case
though and we have shoes underneath our
socks you probably be pretty
uncomfortable your socks might not even
fit over your shoes either way socks
underneath shoes or shoes underneath
socks are not the same thing so we're
going to have to check no on this one
and last but not least we have two
functions that are getting dressed and
taking a shower now one of these seems
to produce a pretty normal everyday
activity you take a shower and then you
get dressed but what if we did things
the other way around I for one will be
pretty sad if I put on my favorite dress
and then got in the shower and got
myself soaking wet that would not be a
great start to my day so I think we can
safely say that taking a shower and then
getting dressed is very different from
getting dressed and then taking a shower
so no the two compositions of these
functions that we could do are not the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
