looks like in SRAM and DRAM technology
the bit sits at the intersection of a
word line that passes by many bits and a
bit line that also passes by many bits
so memory is a matrix of cells like this
and theorem will also have a word line
and a bit line what the word line does
is it controls a transistor here that
can open or close itself to connect the
cell to the bit line so the idea is that
if we want to access this cell we
activate this word line which opens this
transistor and now the memory cell is
connected to the bit line so if you want
to write data we put the bit line at the
value we want and the cell gets that
value if we want to read the data we'll
let go of the bit lines and then the
cell here we'll get a new value on the
bit line so we can sense what it is in
SRAM the actual memory cell consists of
two inverters each inverter has two
transistors that's how you build an
inverter and the idea is that if this is
one here then this inverter flips it and
outputs a zero here this other inverter
flips that and outputs one here so once
we disconnect this transistor this cell
will keep its value it's going to
maintain a zero here because that zero
is inverted and output is a 1 here which
amplifies this zero here so we have a
feedback loop here that keeps the data
that we want so how do we write to this
cell so if we try to put a 1 here this
inverter here is working against us
because it is a 1 it wants to output a
zero and the answer to that is that this
transistor here connects this cell to
the bit line if we put a stronger one
here because these are small inverters
we can defeat them so that even though
this inverter is trying to put a 0 here
we defeat it with a 1 and then what
happens is now that this is a 1 this
inverter will output a 0 here this
inverter now starts outputting a 1 and
the
becomes the one to make that easier
typically we have two of these
transistors and two bit lines for the
same cell that have the opposite values
so for this cell to become a 1 we put 1
here and 0 here that puts a 1 here at
the same time when we are putting a 0
here so these are more easily defeated
when we want to read we can connect both
of them to the bit lines and if we wrote
a 1 here we will have this one be 1 this
one be 0 so this line really outputs the
bit we want and this one just outputs
the opposite value of the bit we want by
looking at the difference between these
bit lines we can more quickly detect
what the cell actually has as we said
these are weak transistors here so once
we connect this cell to the bit lines
the bit line is long and in order to for
example raise the voltage on the bit
line to a value that corresponds to 1
this transistor skier are weak and
cannot pull it to one very fast they
also will try to lower this one down to
zero and they may not be able to do that
very fast so at the other end here where
we are trying to detect what's in this
cell instead of looking at when will
this cross a threshold between a 0 and a
1 what we look at is in what direction
is the difference of these two going we
make them initially about halfway
between 0 and 1 we then activate the
word line the cell now starts let's say
pulling this one up and lowering this
one down if we look at what's the
difference very quickly we will detect
that this one here because it's drawn
towards 1 is getting to be larger
voltage than the voltage on this one so
we can now say that the cell had a 1
before it actually manages to pull this
fully to 1 and lower this fully to 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
