challenging question over here and it
goes as follows one of the weaknesses of
slam is as we move along and map world
by seeing these landmarks the matrix
Omega which is the big thing here and of
course the rekt oxy grow linearly with
the length of the path now this means if
you go to a local supermarket and buy a
robot and the robot lives for a long
time say a year or a decade then this
thing here the path will be really
really large even though the environment
in which might operate the map might be
of a fixed size and that means a robot
programmed by graph slam will eventually
stop working because it gets slower and
slower now we all know computer
operating systems that have their
property the older they are the slower
they are we're not talking about how to
fix operating systems just talking about
how to fix slam so the crucial idea that
I want to tell you about and they want
you to implement from scratch in our
software is the following we can
actually reduce the map you maintain to
one that only contains the most recent
position in the path and all of the
stuff over here can be safely erased
when we build a map so you don't know
how to do it but let me tell you suppose
we have a robot position and we have a
matrix Omega it only contains the
information pertaining to one position
if the position is one dimensional it's
just one row and one column whereas you
might have many different entries for
the map so support this robot moves to a
new position let's call it XT plus 1
then we do exactly the following we grow
the matrix and the vector by using the
expand function that you're very
familiar with such that we now have
space for our new position the new area
we added are these rows over here it's a
single row of numbers of our positions
one dimensional it's two rows of number
of our position is two-dimensional and
it's this column again it's just a
single column if a positions one
dimensional otherwise it's two column
and we initialize those all by zero and
then we can apply our regular motion
update that as you know
adds one or some lava like one to the
main diagonal and minus ones off
diagonal and the same on the right side
for the vector C there is a little
motion update but that one's the risk
there are path increases so now we go
back to a form like this we make XT plus
1 survived simplified speaking you might
think about doing this by just cutting
out the new sub matrix that starts over
here and the sub vector that starts over
here however if we do this as you can
easily verify that sub matrix doesn't
give you the correct answer
and here's where the meters we now cut
out 3 sub matrices or values from the
full matrix on the right side once it's
here
Neven i will call a 1 is over here it's
a single element for a 1d robot but it's
a 2 by 2 matrix for a robot in 2d
coordinates and one that are called C
and it's obvious to see that this thing
over here that you go to cut out is
called a minus 1 these value carry a lot
of importance we can't just erase them
but we can fold them back into the
surviving matrix by the following simple
operation we take the surviving matrix
to be called Omega prime and the
surviving vector to UX prime and
knicking and Omega Prime and X prime by
using the function take that is in your
matrix library you have to look into how
to make take take exactly those elements
over here and then we modify X priming C
prime with the following piece of math
we subtract 4 from Omega prime a
transpose times B to the minus 1 the
inverse times a if the implement is
correctly this gives you a matrix of the
same size of Sigma prime and that's what
you subtract to arrive at our reduce
Sigma similarly you do the same foxy you
subtract a prime minus B to the minus 1
times C this tends to be the same as a
Gaussian we technically do away or we
call it integrate away the variable X
and I don't want to go into detail
whether that's correct
my book has the multi-page proof of that
simple equation I just want to give you
an intuition here which is these values
do carry importance and to get rid of
those you have to reduce with them into
the remaining variables and that over
here happens to be the math so it's a
transpose times B times a that you
subtract from the remaining Omega Prime
and the same folks see over here when
you do this you are now left with the
matrix of the same original dimension
because we first added the post and then
we subtracted one and as you can see
when you do this many many times
the final dimension of the matrix is
only determined based on the size of the
map plus well a single entry which in
the 1d case is one row and one column in
the 2d case is two of those
corresponding to the vulgar position
that means slam scales to really large
environments because we can do the trick
every single time a robot moves so you
asked for a challenging programming
assignment I promise you you'll be busy
with it for a while I'm giving you now
my piece of code in which I implemented
slam for you you're familiar with this
you have all of that and then I run slam
with three landmarks three time steps
world size of 100 and a measurement
range of 100 I make data at random as
you familiar with and you compute the
result and the result in this case
contains a vector of Omega C and mu
concatenated then what I might get out
looks as follows there's three landmarks
there is a sequence of estimated
positions leading up to the actual robot
position they're about correct and then
there's estimates for vet landmarks are
every time I run it I get a different
answer because my landmarks and my world
is different at every time now you're
also implemented and that's your task
now a function called online slam and
that's exactly what I told you to do it
resizes the matrix every time a new
motion occurs and then goes back to the
original size and I've printed out here
as an example the information matrix
Omega and the vector C
that are obtained and also printed out
the final result in the final results we
get exactly the same estimated pose as
for the full slammer rhythm which is
eighty six point zero and thirty three
and eight point seven so go down these
are exactly the same number for the
estimated post that's how you can verify
this the same is true for the estimated
landmark those coordinates are identical
despite the fact that I reduce the size
of Omega and C by when I print Omega and
C we find that the dimensionality is
reduced it's an eight by eight matrix
Omega and the number eight comes because
there are six coordinates for the
landmarks and one final robot pose that
is substantially smaller than the matrix
I would obtain for the full slam case
and the same is true for the information
vector of size eight here's an example
so what you are asked to do is to fill
the entire online slam routine and to do
this every time you get a new pose you
want to expand to grow the matrix by
inserting something right behind the
existing posts we then run take to take
out the sub matrix you also calculate a
B and for the information vector C and
then as before your reduced Omega is
obtained with this equation and you
reduce C is obtained by this equation if
you make no mistake then you get exactly
the same value as you have before and we
can test your routine and arbitrary maps
and arbitrary data sets in little just
be fine
so good luck this is a wonderful
programming assignment because it gives
you the first V is scalable stem
algorithm and when you implement it's
actually a major achievement I can tell
you I took the scientific feat of slam
easily fifteen years to really discover
this form in ever since but was very
complex and involved lots of common
Thetas and I can tell you lots of
headaches became amazingly easy so
implemented and you can call yourself a
robotic mapper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
