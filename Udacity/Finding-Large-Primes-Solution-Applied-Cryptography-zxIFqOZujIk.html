p must not be Prime and the reason for
that is p is greater than p n and we
said this set includes all prime numbers
that's the assumption that we started
with for this proof and this number is
the product of many numbers all of these
are positive adding one to it so the
value of p must be greater than P sub N
and that means according to our
assumption about the limited set of all
Prime's P must not be prime so since P
is not a prime that means it must be
composite which means it must leave you
the product of some prime number and
some other integer so that means we can
write P as some prime and we've said all
the primes are in the set so it's
something selected from that set x some
other number we don't know what q is
other than that must be an integer so
now we have P which we computed as the
product of all these primes plus 1 which
is equal to some prime from that set
times q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
