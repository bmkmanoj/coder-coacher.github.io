have an answer indeed
okay what's the answer okay maybe I
don't have an answer indeed but I have I
have the ability to compute one okay I'm
doing some math so once you walk me
through the math you're doing
I got 0.32 776 um that is correct
Michael woohoo that was trickier than I
thought okay well show me what you did
all right so the first thing I did as I
said
okay well this is not so hard because
from the start state if I execute up up
right right right each of those things
works the way it's supposed to do
independently with probability 0.8 yep
and so 0.8 raised to the fifth power
gives me the probability that that
entire sequence will work as intended
exactly what is point eight to the fifth
do you know 30 2007 or 68 with a decimal
point in front of it cuz you know powers
it - Wow that is correct but I noticed
that three two seven six eight is not
three two seven seven six no they differ
by a little smidge mm-hmm so this is
what occurred to me next is is there any
way that you could have ended up falling
into the goal from that sequence of
commands not following the intended path
so since actions can have unintended
consequences as they often do mm-hmm I
was gonna ask okay so if I go up in the
first step there's a probability point
one that I'll actually go to the right
yep
from there if I go up there's a 10%
probability that I'll actually go to the
right mm-hmm from there the next thing I
do is take the right action but that can
actually go up with some probability
point one you know and then another
point one to get to for the next right
action to actually cause an up to happen
mm-hmm and then finally that last right
might actually execute correctly and
bring me into the goal so I could go
underneath the barrier instead of around
the barrier with that same sequence it
just isn't very likely okay well how
unlikely is it all right so I did point
1 times 0.1 times 0.1 times 0.1 times
0.8 so the 0.1 to the 4 times 0.8 and
that's right so this is the probability
that the four of these sequences go for
go wrong in fact exactly the first for
it go wrong and the last one goes right
right and that's equal to some very very
small number and when you add it up you
end up with 0.32 seven seven six in fact
that's equal to zero zero zero zero
eight and that's how you get that number
and that's correct and you'll notice
that this this sequence happens to work
out to be the second sequence that we
had option four yeah the other thing
that took us to the goal rate was
exactly the probability of executing
that action executing that sequence of
transitions given the first command yeah
and I think it would work the other way
too it no it wouldn't quite work the
other way if you had done the sequence
right right what is it right right up up
right yeah in order for that one to work
out it had point eight to the five of
working and for it to work out wrong but
work out right the right would have to
send you up and then the UPS would have
to send you right and yeah so it would
actually work out to be the same yeah so
no matter which of the two sequences you
came up with they would have the same
probability of succeeding nice that's
actually kind of cool so good job
Michael very good job on the quiz a lot
of people forget this part and in fact
if you forgot that part and got just
this part right we actually let you pass
but it was wrong I was kind of expecting
you to get it wrong but I'm glad you got
it right - thank you Michael I
appreciate your face I wrote the quiz
actually I stole this from a book which
oh those little words are now showing up
in front of you exactly where you can go
through the details of this quiz okay
all right Michael so you might ask
yourself why I brought this up and the
reason I brought this up is because what
we did in the first case where we just
came up with the sequence up up right
right right is we sort of planned out
what we would do in a world where
nothing could go wrong but once we
introduced this notion of uncertainty
this this randomness the stochasticity
we have to do something other than work
out in advance what the right answer is
and then just go we have to do something
a little bit more complicated either we
have to try to execute these and then
every once in a while see if we've
drifted away and then our e^x replan
come up with a new sequence wherever it
is we happen to end up or you have to
come up with
some way to incorporate all of these
uncertainties and probabilities so that
we never really have to think we think
what to do in case something goes wrong
so what I'm going to do next is I'm
going to introduce a framework that's
very common that people use as a way of
capturing this stuff capturing these
uncertainties directly okay hmm
you ready yeah excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
