Catalano and welcome to this week's
coffee break
I just want to Udacity intro to
psychology class and I've had a blast
making it so I want to give you a
behind-the-scenes look at what it takes
to actually make my class first we start
with planning where Greg ensues and the
professor's I work with from SJSU send
me a lesson plan and the three of us
together find a way to you'd Asif I the
script and once we come up with a script
that we really like and makes it really
engaging for you guys and fun for us to
teach we hit the recording studio once
we need a record we go into one of our
cordoning studios which are equipped
with a camera and a tablet the camera
records our handwriting the notes to
give you a visually engaging an
interactive way to learn with a little
bit of a personal touch so then we go to
headshots which if you notice from the
site class we have a lot of this is when
you actually see the lights camera in
action to give you a more personal
experience
once we complete recording we hand the
raw footage off to our editing team who
through the magic of editing come up
with a product that you actually see and
interact with on the website thanks for
joining me on this week's coffee break
where we gave you an inside look at how
we actually produce these classes I hope
you enjoy my internal psychology class
and the rest of the Udacity classes
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
