consider risk in this scenario let's
look at first this idea of what's the
chance that you might lose at all so you
put out your bets on the thousand tables
the coins are flipped in that event
what's the chance you lose all all of
your money in the single bet case where
you put all of your money on a single
table and the outcome is determined by
the flip of a single coin remember even
though it's biased in your favor there
still is a 49% chance it'll come out
against you so if you put all your money
on a single table for one coin there's a
49% chance that you'll lose all of it
that's pretty high
I mean consider that in the context of
you know would you put your savings
account on a single bet like that now I
want you to think a little bit consider
the multi bet case where we put one
token on each of the 1,000 tables so
there's a thousand coin flips and our
return is determined by the result of
all those individual thousand coin flips
what is the chance that we would lose it
all in that case well the answer to that
is that it's the probability that we
lose on the first table times the
probability that we lose on the second
table times the probability we lose on
the third and as you can see we do this
for all of the thousand tables and
multiply those probabilities all
together and that's the probability we
would lose everything in that multi bet
scenario that is a very very small
number it's 0.49 to the 1000th power how
small is it let's try and calculate it
on a calculator so it's 0.49 raised to
the 1000th power
we'll see how small that is it's so
small it's not even a number that's how
small it is okay let's look at another
way to evaluate risk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
