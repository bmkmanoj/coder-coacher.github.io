human beings are hard-wired to receive
things in story form so if you can craft
a narrative behind what you're doing
that makes it easy to it makes it makes
it more compelling and you know it
doesn't have to be you know like a
coming-of-age story or anything like
that could you know simply be like like
there was this problem there exists this
problem here's what people previously
did here's why it's not any good we did
this here's what we found in like that's
the end so there's this sort of like
there's this narrative arrow that goes
that goes through it and so that's one
and number two I guess the other tip
that I would have is think about your
audience who is your audience are your
audience is already technically oriented
are they not technically oriented is
your goal basically is here are you
trying is it a bunch of people that
you're trying to recruit to come and
join you in which case maybe you want to
show them like cool demos or are they
you know just just like a roomful of
your hard-nosed science colleagues who
are just going to brutally scrutinize
whatever you present to them in which
case you may want to do something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
