implement reduce in a serial life sort
of the traditional way that we all know
and love and so the structure of this
looks a little bit like map in both
produce and map we loop through all of
our elements but it's different in an
important way in map each loop iteration
is independent we can run these
simultaneously and in any order we
choose in reduce on the other hand each
iteration is dependent on the previous
iteration and here's the serial code to
some a series of elements and this is
relatively straightforward we have a
serial variable named sum we initialize
it to zero we then loop through our set
of elements and on each iteration add
the current element to the previous sum
and so when we're done we can return
this sum variable and we're done so in
the first iteration we do this first add
here and we take the result on the
second iteration do a second add here on
the third iteration we do a third add
and so on so what's different about this
that the map example is that this add
operation is dependent on the previous
one whereas in map all these things can
happen in parallel and at the same time
so now let's take a little bit of a
closer look at a serial reduction we're
going to take five pieces of data here
ABCDE and reduce them using the plus
operator first how many operations does
it take to perform the sural reduction
so we can just count the operations one
two three four so four operations that's
our amount of work the next thing we're
going to do is count the number of steps
it takes so that would be one two three
four so it's also four steps so a quiz
which of these four statements are true
about a serial reduction code running on
an input of size n arbitrary size first
it takes n operations then it takes n
minus 1 operations or it's work
complexity is order of n proportional to
the size of the input or it's step
complexity is order of one independent
of the size of the input so please check
which ones are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
