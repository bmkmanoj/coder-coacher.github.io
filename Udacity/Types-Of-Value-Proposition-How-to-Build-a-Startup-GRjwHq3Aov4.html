types of value propositions and kind of
as a Venn diagram so what comes from
technical insights are making things
more efficient or smaller or faster and
sometimes we lower cost and simpler what
comes from market insights or better
distribution and bundling and branding
but sometimes what you have is this
sweet spot in the middle that actually
is a combination of technical and market
insights that makes for a killer value
proposition so let's take a look at some
examples of technical insights there's a
company called ice idiot
that was a outgrowth of the Stanford
math department where a PhD student said
listen we could do a topological
analysis of highly dimensional data to
be analyzed without pre determining the
number of feature sets boy that's a
mouthful but it turns out that this is
the world's best way to go through big
datasets huge data sets in a way that
was just computationally not possible
before and in fact once they had their
technical insight they started to talk
to customers about pains and gains and
it was an enormous ly effective product
to solve problems that were so painful
they just couldn't be approached before
another example was that startup called
in scopus that mass produced components
to create a miniaturize fluorescence
microscope it turns out that this
technical insight allowed them to reduce
the size of a device that took up a
tabletop that could now fit in your hand
and in fact they created an entirely new
market that solve problems that
customers didn't even imagine until they
actually saw this new device on the
other hand there's some examples of
market insight you know Zynga was one of
the first companies to realize that
people wanted to play games online that
were more involved that were currently
offered they not only wanted to play
solitaire but they actually wanted to
play games that involved interaction
with other people and their big insight
was Facebook as the distribution channel
for those games Twitter another example
of market insight masses of people are
more likely to write a 140 characters
than a thousand words
everybody was skeptical but it turns out
it plugged into something that was both
a market and a human nature insight
it solved the need Zipcars insight was
actually kind of interesting is that
instead of just renting cars on business
trips it might be that people in urban
areas are in college campuses no longer
wanted to own cars but wanted to be able
to get them with incredible flexibility
a lot more than the traditional rental
car companies offered and Zipcar
actually had a market insight that made
it a successful public company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
