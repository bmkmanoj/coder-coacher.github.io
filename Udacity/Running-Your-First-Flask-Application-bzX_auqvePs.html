application in flask create a file named
project PI in the same directory as the
database setup dot PI file a minimal
flask application looks something like
this
let's take a look at this code together
and see what's going on first I imported
this flask class from the flask library
next I create an instance of this class
with the name of the running application
has the argument any time we run an
application in Python a special variable
called name gets defined for the
application and all the imports it uses
the application run by the Python
interpreter gets a name variable set to
double underscore main double underscore
whereas all the other imported Python
files get a double underscore name
double underscore variable set to the
actual name of the Python file next I
have this thing that looks like a
function but starts with an @ symbol
this is called a decorator in Python
this decorator essentially wraps our
function inside the app dot route
function that flask is already created
so if either of these routes gets sent
from the browser the function that we
define here gets executed
if this is difficult to follow it's ok
I'll provide a link in the instructor
notes if you're interested in learning
more about decorator functions just know
that this @ app dot route piece of code
will call the function that follows it
whenever the web server receives a
request with the URL that matches its
argument so in this case if we visit the
root of my site at local host port 5,000
or local host port 5,000 slash hello
this HelloWorld function will be invoked
inside my hello world function I return
the message I want to display to the
user's browser jumping to the last line
of our code I used the run function to
run the local server with our
application the if statement here make
sure the server only runs if the script
is executed directly from the Python
interpreter and not used as an imported
module so basically this line of code
says if you're executing me with the
Python interpreter then do this but if
you're importing me into another Python
file don't do this but you still have
access to the rest of the code by
default the server is only accessible
from the host machine and not from any
other computer this is the default
because in debugging mode a user of the
application can execute arbitrary Python
code on your computer since we're using
a vagrant environment for this course we
must make our server publicly available
by changing the call of the run method
to look like this
this tells the web server on my vagrant
machine to listen on all public IP
restarting our server each time we make
a modification to our code can get
pretty annoying but flats can take care
of this for us if you enable debug
support the server will reload itself
each time it notices a code change it
will also provide you a helpful debugger
in the browser if things go wrong I'll
save this code as project PI in the same
directory as my restaurant menu DB file
and execute it with the Python
interpreter visiting localhost port 5000
or localhost port 5000 slash hello
I see the output of my code to stop the
server I hit ctrl C so we see that with
much fewer lines of code I executed a
similar version of our hello world from
lesson 2 notice that with flask we don't
have to explicitly write out response
codes anymore you will soon see that
this is just one of the several features
frameworks take care of automatically
