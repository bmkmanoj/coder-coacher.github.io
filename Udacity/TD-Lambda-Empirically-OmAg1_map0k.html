through or maybe guess what's gonna
happen if TD lambda is run as an update
algorithm on some finite amount of data
so we give it
do we give the system some finite amount
of data and then we run TD lambda with
different possible values of lambda and
then we ask all right the V that you've
learned how far is that from what the V
should have been if we had infinite data
mm-hmm
all right so let's um I don't know let's
sort of see if we can figure out or
maybe even guess what this might look
like so let's say if we use lambda
equals zero so we do TD zero so after
some finite amount of data there's gonna
be some amount of error let's just you
know I don't know call it that okay now
it turns out empirically if you play
with this it's it's pretty typical for
TD one to give you worse error given
finite data and now the important thing
is what happens in between so it could
be like a straight line if it was
literally interpolating it could be kind
of bowed up but it's actually typically
bowed down so it's it's not so atypical
to see a curve kind of like this that
that gets better the amount of error
goes down as lambda gets to some
intermediate value let's call it I don't
know point seven it depends of course on
this on the particular problem and then
kind of start to shoot up again and
eventually hit the error for TD 1 as
lambda approaches 1 and so this is kind
of the justification for why we want to
consider TD lambda that it's actually
combining these two different sources of
information what happens at the end of
an episode and what happens at each step
in a way that actually takes advantage
of both gets you the benefits of both
you were rapidly propagating information
and we're not getting a biased estimate
because of the way that we're using
one-step information so it you know it
has some attractiveness to it huh did
you pick point 7 on purpose I remember
reading a paper once that suggested that
basically everyone uses lambda equal to
point 7 I typically see you know 0.3 to
0.7 as values where things tend to work
out where this bottom tends to fall
somewhere between point three and point
seven personally I always use 0 because
it works better with control I just I
have had better performance and better
understanding of what happened
zero case but but it is true that if you
actually run it with a finite amount of
data it tends to bottom out somewhere
between three and point three and point
seven hmm okay that's worth knowing so
that's actually all I wanted to tell you
about TD lambda I wanted to give you a
sense of how the equations are defined
and how they're derived and empirically
why this is something that we actually
care about so maybe we should sum up oh
I'm a big fan of size is this gonna be
an infinite sum thank you I've been here
