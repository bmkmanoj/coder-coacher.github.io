expect to need n over two times as much
the reason for this is because of this
step Bob randomly picks one of the
puzzles and solves just that puzzle once
bob has solved it he sends back the
number of the puzzle that he solved
which was part of the puzzle to Alice
and that establishes the shared key an
attacker can hear that number but
doesn't know which of the encrypted
messages corresponds to that so the
attacker would need to try and break all
of the encrypted messages and would be
expected to find the one that matches
the one that Bob picked after trying
about half of them so this is a neat
idea that n over 2 advantage is really
not enough for that to be significant we
would have to have a really large number
of puzzles that involves a lot of work
for Alice Alice still needs to create
all those puzzles and requires a lot of
bandwidth we'd have to send all those
puzzles across the network so a very
impractical idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
