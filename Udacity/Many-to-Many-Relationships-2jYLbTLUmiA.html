types of relationships you can have in a
database databases organize data and
these pieces of data can have
relationships with one another there's
one-to-one one-to-many many-to-one and
many-to-many relationships an example of
a one-to-one relationship is the user
and their email address we say
one-to-one because each user has one
email address and each email address is
associated with one user at least in
shopping lists plus plus this is how it
was if instead we'd allowed each user to
have multiple email addresses this would
have been a one-to-many relationship
because one user could contain many
email addresses another example of this
is shopping less than items each item
exists uniquely in exactly one shopping
list it therefore has one container
shopping list but if we look at a
shopping list relation to items it
contains many items an example of a
many-to-many relationship is the
relationship between users and shopping
lists if we didn't have shared shopping
lists and you just made lists for
yourself it would be a one-to-many
relationship
each user would have a collection of
shopping lists they own and have access
to and each of these shopping lists
would have exactly one person who could
add them the owner but that would be a
pretty lame app instead each person has
a collection of many lists to have
access to and each list has a collection
of many users that have access to it as
you might example or as a one-to-one
relationship is pretty easy to show in
your data and even a one-to-many
relationship is about as complicated as
a list many to many relationships get a
bit more tricky I've provided some links
in the instructor notes below to talk in
more depth about these relationships
when everything is constricted to tables
things get a little more interesting
than in our JSON world with how you
represent things like many 10:1 and
one-to-many relationships</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
