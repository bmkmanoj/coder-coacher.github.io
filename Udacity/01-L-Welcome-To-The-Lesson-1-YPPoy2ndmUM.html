were using for our analytics was perfect
it would save so much time just being
able to blend it together and run with
it but that almost never happens usually
when we get data there are issues with
it that requires to spend large
quantities of time to clean it up we
might get a file that hasn't been parsed
properly maybe there are multiple
columns all appearing in a single column
which we'd need to fix there could be
junk in a field like strange characters
that we need to clean up it's also
possible to have duplicate records
appear in your data set all these issues
make it difficult to just use the data
directly and they all require some level
of effort for us to clear up the problem
before the data can be used in this
lesson we'll look at the most common
issues we find with data will discuss
some approaches on how to address these
problems and practice cleaning a few
data sets by the end of this lesson
we'll be able to identify problems in
our data sets like missing data and
outliers and then use some of the
techniques we learn to clean them up
clean data sets will put us on the best
path to building successful analytics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
