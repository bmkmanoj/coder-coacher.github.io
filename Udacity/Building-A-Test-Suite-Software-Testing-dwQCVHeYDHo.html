briefly about bidding a test suite for a
piece of software so a test suite is
just a collection of tests and it's
often the case that the test suite can
be run automatically it's also often the
case the test suite gets run
periodically so for example perhaps in
nightly on every commit although many
cases that's infeasible since if commits
are frequent and the test case is slow
the goal of a test suite is to show that
some software under test has some
desired properties namely passing all
the tests although it's very common for
real software to almost always be in a
state of partial failure but what we
hope is that most of the time most of
these failures are not particularly
severe ones so the question is if you're
maintaining a software project what goes
in the test suite and to a large extent
this is a matter of taste and preference
but on the other hand there's some
pretty common features of nearly all
test Suites it's very common first of
all to have a lot of unit tests or at
least feature specific tests that are
small tests that exercise very
specialized behaviors so for example if
we're developing some sort of a web
browser we might have tested effects at
different HTML and it's rendered
correctly and that sort of thing it's
also very common for a test suite to
contain large realistic inputs it's so
for example if we're testing some sort
of a microprocessor maybe we'd boot up
Linux and run it for a couple of hours
and the purpose of these kind of inputs
is to provide realistic stresses on the
system and to exercise a lot of features
in combination and make sure the things
are up to snuff it's nearly always a
good idea to include a regression test
in a test suite a regression test is
basically any input that's caused any
version of the software under test to
fail at any time and there's several
reasons that regression tests exist the
main one of which is that we want to
make sure that the software under test
doesn't regress that is to say it
doesn't go back into a state in which it
fails on about what we already fixed and
there are a number of reasons why that
could happen first of all regression
tests are useful because whatever the
defect was in a software that caused the
bug in the first place we might not have
gotten rid of all the instances of that
defect in a source code so for example a
buggy piece of code might have been cut
and pasted to several other places and
those other locations might not be
causing our system to fail currently but
some other change might enable the buggy
code to fire and make the bug happen
again another reason it is pretty easy
through for example mess ups with the
revision control system to accidentally
go back to an old version of a file
before we fix the bug
if that happens we want to catch it as
soon as possible because because some
regression test chips the third reason
is that defects and software come from
errors and people's thinking it's pretty
often the case that the person who
introduced a defect into the software
didn't actually correct the error that
they had a
thinking rather maybe somebody else
fixed the defect and the person retains
their mistaken assumption about some
sort of an API or something and due to
this latent error in somebody's head
they can go ahead and start adding
similar defects to the system later on
and if we have good regression tests we
stand more of a chance of catching those
kind of things and something that
usually doesn't go into a test suite is
a random tester and for whatever reason
I'm not totally sure that I understand
all the reasons even random testing is
often treated as a separate activity
this is related to the fact that random
tests often are non deterministic unless
we're being careful to preserve the same
seed they don't have a clear correctness
criterion and perhaps more importantly
random tests always have a possibility
of showing us something new that is to
say they have the possibility of
introducing a test case that we haven't
seen before in fact that's what we hope
will happen and the reason that might be
undesirable is the test suite is
supposed to be predictable it's supposed
to consist of things that we know to
test for now if all of a sudden the test
suite starts containing new and
different tests then that's not
necessarily good so for whatever
combination of these reasons random
testing is often a separate activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
