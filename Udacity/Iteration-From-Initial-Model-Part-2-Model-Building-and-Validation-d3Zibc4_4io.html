so far we started with the initial
question how popular were the different
brands of candy we then thought about
what sort of quantity should we use to
make this question quantitative inter
selection time total number of
selections and we ended up going with
inter selection time with a way to
quantify the problem in hand we then had
to cast the question as a rigorous
statistical inference problem such as
confident sets or classification we
ended up going with point estimation
specifically we chose to create a
regression estimator in which given the
candy and the particular choice number
what is the inter selection time of that
candy specifically how long has it been
since someone shows that particular
candy previously we took a look at some
plots of inter selection time for
individual candies let's examine
multiple plots on the same graph at once
here is depicted the inter selection
times of Rollo and Reese's with Reese's
and blue and Rollo and green as you can
see the average inter selection time of
Reese's starts out lower but jumps a bit
at the end and vice versa for rolla
recall that lower inter selection time
corresponds to higher demand and
conversely higher inter selection time
corresponds to lower demand thus Reese's
starts out in high demand but then
gradually gets selected less and less
often conversely Rollo starts out in low
demand and gradually becomes selected
more often this plot lends some support
to the notion that in fact there is some
interaction between different brands of
candy in the candy bowl if true this
should not be very surprising the brands
of candy do not sit in the candy bowl in
isolation a person's choice of
particular candy is influenced by the
presence of other candies in the bull if
in fact people preferred one brand of
candy overall to another then you'd
expect the time between selections for
one brand below at the same time the
other was high as the first one starts
to be depleted the inter selection time
for the second time starts to go down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
