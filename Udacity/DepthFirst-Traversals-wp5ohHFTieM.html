to DFS and trees first we'll talk about
preorder traversal
to me the priest says check off a note
as soon as you see it before you
traverse any further in the tree there
are other methods of traversal in which
you check off nodes after you've seen
their children so this rule is really
important to keep in mind we start at
the root and immediately check off that
we've seen it
next we pick one of the children
normally the left one by convention and
check it off too we would continue
traversing down the leftmost nodes until
we hit a leaf we check off the leaf and
from there go back up to the parent now
we can traverse to the right child and
check it off - we're done with this
subtree so we can travel back up to the
root and look at its right child we do
the same steps until we've seen
everything cool we're done this might
seem intuitive but it'll make more sense
once we compare it against a different
type of traversal like an inorder
traversal the trick here is that we're
moving through the nodes in the same
order since this is still a DFS and we
need to explore all children first
however this time we're going to check
off the nodes in a different order we're
only going to check off a node when
we've seen its left child and come back
to it alright let's see what this looks
like again we start at the root since we
haven't seen the left child yet we have
to keep traversing down until we hit a
leaf we check off the leaf and move up
to the parent because we've seen the
left child now we can actually check off
the parent this time we move on to this
right node which has no children so we
can check it off too we go back up to
the root and repeat all of this on the
right side until we're done why is this
called in order well we pretty much went
through the nodes in order from the
leftmost
to the right we had to move up and down
a lot but if you just look strictly at
left to right we actually did go through
everything in order lastly we have the
postorder traversal this time we won't
be able to check off a node until we've
seen all of its descendants or we
visited both of its children and
returned similar steps we begin at the
root don't check it off but can
you down to a leaf we check off the leaf
and move to the parent this time we
don't check off the parent though we
just move on to the right node once
we've checked off the right child we can
go back up to the parent and finally
check it off to again we'll skip over
the root node and just move all the way
down to the right once everything there
is good we can move back up to the root
and get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
