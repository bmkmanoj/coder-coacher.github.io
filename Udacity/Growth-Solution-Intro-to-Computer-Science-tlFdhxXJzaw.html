to determine which of the given
functions scale linearly with the input
list p let's go through the functions
one by one this should look familiar all
some list does is take an input list p
and calculate the sum of the numbers in
p in this case the worst in the best
case are really the same because no
matter what you traverse this for loop
for the length of p and accordingly if
you double the number of items in p you
also double the runtime because you have
to go through twice as many items in
this for loop and so the runtime of some
list scales linearly with the number of
items in the list p this procedure
determines whether or not a given list p
has duplicate elements let's go through
a quick example here's a small list with
the element 0 1 and 1 going through the
code here we have I and we have J in the
first iteration of the loops I and J are
both going to be 0 that means we're
looking at whether the first element is
equivalent to the first element well we
have this case right here that says not
to compare one element with the same
element with itself so J increments and
now we're comparing the first element
with the second element they're not the
same we do that again the first element
with the third element they're not the
same we then increment I and reset j 0
and 1 are not the same one and one are
not the same and lastly we have one and
then two and in this case the second
element and the third element are the
same so we're going to return true
that's how this works now in order to
examine the runtime the key part here
are these two for loops for this for
loop we're going to go roughly the
length of p and for every length for
every element of p we're also going to
go roughly the length of p this creates
a quadratic runtime in relation to the
nellen number of elements in p namely if
we double the number of elements when p
we're going to increase the runtime of
the entire procedure by a factor of four
and here we have our mystery function
you've never seen this before but the
general structure should be familiar
here we have a while loop and we're
going to we set I 20 and we're going to
continue this while loop until I is
greater than or equal to the length of P
and looking down here we're basically
going to be iterating through p but
we're going to do it a little different
than normal if the L
in p at index I is even we're going to
increment I by 2 otherwise we're going
to increment it by 1 so the worst case
for this function in terms of runtime is
if every element in P is odd meaning we
only increment I by one for each
iteration so we're going to go at half
the speed that we would if every element
in P was even simplifying the worst case
all we have is a while loop through le
every element in the list P so this is
clearly linear in the worst case I'll
also note that in the best case the
runtime of the mystery function is also
linear and that may be a little
confusing at first because it goes twice
as fast but we're really concentrating
on the growth of the runtime so that
even if it is going twice as fast as the
worst case if we double the number of
elements in the list p the runtimes also
going to double</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
