Emmy results is when you can combine
your ancestry and trade information and
you can do this when you have family
members that have results too so you can
see exactly which alleles you share with
which family members let's take joanna
mountains family as an example here's
her family tree or pedigree this is
Joanna this is her husband Hayward her
children miles and Sheamus and their
grandparents David Susan Anthony and
Tasha one big question that Joanna and
her husband had about one of her
children Sheamus is that he has blue
eyes while both of his parents Joanna
and Hayward have brown eyes of course
Joanna knew that I color was determined
genetically which meant that she knew
that sheamus's blue eyes must have been
passed down from her and her husband and
ultimately from their individual parents
sheamus's grandparents so Joanna set out
encoded their family tree or pedigree
here with the eye colors of her children
her and her husband and their parents
now unfortunately the maternal and
paternal grandfather's were deceased but
the paternal and maternal grandmother's
were still alive and we know that they
both had brown eyes and the question was
were either of them contributing to the
blue eyes that we see in Sheamus so a
simple saliva sample from each and every
one of these six individuals that we
know something about here was collected
now one of the alleles important in
determining eye color is a gene called
her c2 which we'll learn more about in
lesson 9 now without explaining the
whole story one allele of her c2 is
recessive and promotes blue eye color
and another allele is dominant and
promotes brown eye color so for Sheamus
to have blue eyes that must mean that he
inherited two recessive copies of the
her c 2 gene from each of his parents
this means that Sheamus is homozygous
recessive in each of his parents Joanna
and Heyward are heterozygous dominant
for brown and the question is where did
these recessive alleles come from which
of sheamus's grandparents in this case
his paternal or maternal grandmother's
did they contribute
a recessive allele to his eye color so
after submitting a saliva sample for
everyone in the group the 23 me website
allowed the family to compare the
chromosome side by side in this case
we're comparing sheamus's chromosomes
with his paternal grandmother and here
we're comparing his chromosomes to his
maternal grandmother everywhere you see
a shaded blue region indicates shared
ancestry meaning that some of his
chromosomes have inherited a piece from
that individual grandparent anywhere you
don't see shading means that they don't
share that piece of the chromosome and
the red arrow indicates the location of
the her c2 gene on chromosome 15 so
looking at the comparison of sheamus's
chromosomes to his paternal and maternal
grandmother's which grandparent did he
inherit one her c2 allele from and why
go ahead and select which grandmother
you think and then tell me why in the
text box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
