kind of models and we will talk about a
number of them let's sort of explore
what is new thing that we need for
implementing them okay so we are
obviously I said going beyond
discretionary access control well
implementation of these mandatory access
control model is going to require some
new functionality some new mechanisms
the system has to now include so one of
the new things that we're going to talk
about all the time is what is called
sort of these labels that we're going to
associate that's a key new
implementation requirement for defining
these models and for implementing these
models but the idea is that we're going
to see that both users and resources or
documents gonna have certain labels
attached or associated with them and
they're going to get used in the way we
make access control decisions so what's
the purpose of a label that you want to
attach to a document or associate with
the user a label is actually going to
tell us how sensitive certain
information may be labels also actually
have something that describes the nature
of the data you know what topic what
area does the data come from we're
talking payroll data for example before
so labels could also include sort of a
category of the nature of the data that
we have here and that sort of useful in
answering this question who needs to
know or needs to have accessed if you're
in the payroll department of course you
need access to payroll information
labels with documents or data files or
users going to capture something about
the information that's contained in
those documents and the users who need
to access them
so these labels are actually going to
get manipulated each time access to an
object or our document is requested so
PCB is actually not going to associate
but is going to use these labels
associated with user and the object
anytime the request is made so when I
say the labels look right of course we
have to sort of say here is a label for
the user and here is a label for the
document should the user be able to
access this document be able to read it
so we have to sort of
or compare the labels and and we're
going to see results of that that
comparison but you know you're going to
say here is user with this label here is
a document with this other label you
know does the users label imply that he
can access this document okay so we have
to relate compare the labels that we
have now exact nature of what the labels
look like and how we going to be able to
compare them and what the result of that
comparison is well that's going to
depend on a particular model or policy
that we're going to implement we can
look at several different examples and
each one of them has a very different
kind of a label and how you make use of
that label label goes with not just the
document but also with the user and
we'll see examples of those so in the
Department of Defense we are talking
about the labels actually going to
include for a user it will be their
clearance level for a document at what
level the document is classified and
compartment is this category that we are
talking about what kind of information
is contained in this document of course
in the commercial world we don't have
clearances and classification so these
labels have to look different and the
concerns are going to be you know
different kind also for example we may
have conflict of interests concerned so
access control must be such that when
somebody has a conflict they don't get
to access certain document where a
conflict of interest or COI may arise
similarly sometimes you may have
separation of duty requirements the same
person can't do things to different
things when allowing them to do that
requires a level of trust or potential
for fraud and things like that so the
the needs would be different in in
commercial versus DoD or government DoD
