common problem in design and in
development because when you do this you
can really only optimize locally so
what's a good solution for this problem
well in design we have a technique it's
called wire framing or low res wire
framing it helps us really focus on the
UX first and the big picture without
getting caught in the UI details too
soon I know in development they do
something very similar ya know in
development there is a really easy trap
to fall into is when you start coding
you just want to grade functions and you
don't want to think about abstraction
you don't to think about its capsulation
so as a java developer maybe you make
the static class and you have a lot of
methods in it you forget about
interfaces and classes altogether that's
that's again an example of in
development where when you focus on the
details yeah kinda bad things happen so
it's kind of always a good idea in
development and design to think about
the big picture first so the sign in and
the check out example we just gave you
imagine that is part of an experience of
a cooking buying a cookie buying
application so here's how you really get
started
imagine there's a task that your user
wants to complete so for this example
it's I'm hungry for cookies I want to
get someone eat the cookies basically so
then you think about what steps does
your neat user need to go through to
complete this task so this is an easy
example because we only have one task so
the steps would be Sign In decide which
cookies you want pay for your cookies
and then eat the cookies so when we
write out each of these steps at a high
level like this each of these steps is
kind of like a Java interface exactly
when you think about a Java interface
it's something that doesn't have any
implementation so you're not really
thinking about the low-level details but
you're thinking about the contract that
interface has with other interfaces and
classes which in this case if you look
at the steps its how these steps connect
with each other so instead of focusing
on just one step and nothing else you're
really thinking about the big picture
exactly so now that we're thinking about
the sign-in experience as part of our
overall flow in order to buy cookies how
do you think we should start do we need
a sign-in experience you know actually
we might not even need a sign-in
experience we could have an anonymous
experience because what if I just want
to install the app and just get cookies
and maybe after I've used the
application or even gotten some cookies
for the first time I might think ok
maybe I'll use this application again
that's a good point but actually the way
I would use this application is that I
actually do want to sign in because I
want to see my order history and my
famed history and actually I want to
place orders that I've already placed
before so for me like for someone like
me if I was the user I would actually
want the sign-in experience sooner
rather than later
so we could actually give the user an
option of just getting straight into the
app and buying cookies and skipping sign
in 3 or 4 users that are more like you
we could let them sign in initially yeah
that's true so actually what we could do
is instead of having this sign in happen
up front maybe we can actually allow
them to flow through this application
without signing in but when they
actually need to then block them with
the sign in just before checkout I like
that that that would actually end up in
a much nicer flow yeah this is great I
hadn't even thought about it but now
that if we actually move the sign in to
this step it actually ends up in a much
better application I agree I think that
using low-res wireframing really helped
us elevate the whole discussion we could
look at the sign-in experience and
really see how it made the most sense to
put any application overall exactly
which again it results in a much better
application for the end user so we
haven't really changed anything we've
just thought about it a high level and
optimized how they link up just like
good interfaces should and we can worry
about the implementations later I think
this deserves a fist bump low res wire
framing for the wind boom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
