about GPU hardware and how that affects
the programming model so let's summarize
what we've learned so far about the GPU
programming model and start adding to it
in our last lecture we learned about the
programmers view of the GPU and I'm
going to summarize that and then start
adding some more details to it so your
job as the programmer is to divide up
your program into smaller computations
called kernels so a kernel in our case
is a C or C++ function and the key idea
of a kernel is that it's going to be
performed by many threads so a thread is
a path of execution a thread of
execution through the program code and
I've drawn them as Wiggly lines here
because they're not necessarily all
going to take the same path through that
code there might be branches like if
statements or switch statements there
might be for loops for loops 2 loops so
you don't know in advance what path
you're going to take this is not
straight lined code and in fact
different threads might take different
paths so there might be a thread which
takes a completely different path so the
key thing about threads is that they
come in thread blocks a thread block is
a group of threads that cooperate to
solve a subproblem a GPU program
launches many threads to run one kernel
like foo and then they all run to
completion and exit and the program
launches many threads to run the next
kernel like bar another thing to notice
about the way I drew this is that you
notice I have a different number of
thread blocks with a different number of
threads that's actually something you
can pick for each kernel and we'll talk
later about how you would you know why
you would choose different numbers of
threads different number of thread
blocks how you would organize these so
that's the programmers view the GPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
