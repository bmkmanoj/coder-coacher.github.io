confusion about homeworks 2.5 and 2.6
specifically questions about what was
going on with a linear algebra so I want
to talk about some of that today
and I want to do it by comparing the 2d
case and that's the case we talked about
in lecture with the 4d case which is
what you're asked about on the homework
okay so in the 2-dimensional case I want
to first talk about a this.f matrix that
Sebastian was calling the state
transition matrix the idea behind this
matrix was that we wanted to take some
old belief some old state which in the
two dimensional case was represented by
X and X dot where X dot is our velocity
X is our position and from that we want
to extract or predict some new state
which we called X Prime and X dot Prime
and the question was what do we fill in
here to get the proper values for X
Prime and X dot Prime well let's think
what should our position be our
predicted position after some time has
elapsed well we want to include our old
position right so let's let's first draw
these or write out these formulas we
expect that X prime will be composed of
our old position plus whatever motion
was occurring due to the velocity and
that is going to be DT so the time
elapsed times our velocity this is just
velocity times time which tells us how
much our position has changed now in
matrix terms how do we express that well
we're talking about X prime so that
means we're going to think about this
top row here and we want to keep X which
means a 1 goes here we want to multiply
X dot by DT so that means DT goes here
and just like that we figured out the
first row of our F matrix I'll label it
here F now what about the second row
let's do a similar thing for X dot Prime
to figure out what should go in the
second row so after our prediction we
said that we're just going to assume
that the velocity hasn't changed
velocity after equals velocity before so
that means we don't want to have
anything to do with this X means the 0
goes here and then we want everything to
do with this X dot we want to keep this
so we could put a 1 here ok so this kind
of gives us
intuition for how this works in two
dimensions let's see if we can
generalize to four so now again we're
going to some new state and we're doing
that by multiplying a state transition
matrix by some old belief but now
instead of X and X dot we also have
y-coordinates so we have X Y X dot and Y
dot and here we're going to of course
get X Y X dot y dot and all of those are
prime because they indicate after our
prediction now I'm not going to fill in
this 4x4 matrix for you but I think
using similar reasoning to what we did
in the two dimensional case you can come
up with what these formulas should be
and from that fill in this matrix
appropriately remembering that this
entry corresponds to the first row this
entry the second and so on good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
