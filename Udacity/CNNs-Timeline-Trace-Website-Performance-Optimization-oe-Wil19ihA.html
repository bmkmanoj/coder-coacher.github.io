a popular news site to get started I
opened up dev tools by pressing command
option I you can see the dev tools here
here's the HTML so we're in the timeline
now I'm going to see what happens when
the page loads so I'm going to press
command shift our reload the page if we
can see all the events of the page load
laid out in the timeline here well this
is cool for desktop but I wonder what
this looks like on mobile
luckily Chrome gives us the option of
seeing what it looks like on mobile I'm
going to press this button to open up
the console there we go and we can see
that there's a tab up here emulation so
I click on this I see the google nexus 5
and i press emulate so now we're looking
at cnn.com from a mobile perspective but
this looks weird I'm going to fix the
screen a little bit and I'm going to
refresh the page by doing command shift
R and now we see the mobile version of
CNN on the left and our timeline on the
right let me get rid of this bottom part
by pressing escape and move the screen
over to give ourselves a little bit more
room and let's take a look at the
timeline so I've selected about the
first second or so of events when you
see them in a little bit more detail all
right so we see a request here for a
page cnn.com
so when I click on this and open up the
details click on cnn.com and we should
see what this file is scrolling down
this should look pretty familiar it's
just an HTML document going back to the
timeline let's get rid of some of these
details we can see a lot of events up
here if we click on this filter button
it lets us get rid of some of them so we
can just look at what we want I just
want to see the loading events so I'll
get rid of scripting rendering and
painting and now we can see the request
for the home page and the response as
we're receiving data cnn.com
we get that HTML file and then we start
to parse the HTML and it looks like in
parsing it by opening up this step we
see that we requested CSS and JavaScript
after that
scrolling down we can see more requests
for all of the scripts
images and CSS files that are needed to
load the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
