of the necessary technologies you should
be familiar with in order to get the
most out of this course most importantly
you should have a basic understanding of
Python coding if you're comfortable
creating classes writing methods and
understand inheritance you're in good
shape for this course knowledge of SQL
statements such as insert into select
update and delete will also be a useful
skill in this course I will also assume
you're very comfortable reading and
writing HTML code CSS and JavaScript
won't be necessary to complete the
activities but are helpful for creating
a polished presentable final project
knowing your way around a UNIX command
line and being able to navigate to the
file system is also going to come in
handy if you are unfamiliar
I would like to brush up on any of these
topics please refer to instructor notes
for some helpful links to classes and
other references for ease of
configuration and installation I
strongly recommend using a vagrant
machine for this course vagrant allows
you to create a virtual machine on your
computer so that you can program without
worrying about affecting your computer's
current configuration I have provided
you a vagrant file with all the
necessary software already installed a
link to installing this vagrant file is
provided in the instructor notes once
you successfully run vagrant up and
vagrant SSH you're ready to keep going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
