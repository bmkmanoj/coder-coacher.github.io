values that we're going to use and that
come from the collide collide work so
the cocoa value of a game is going to be
defined like this let's imagine that
we've got a general some game with a
notation I'm going to use is you is
payoff to you okay and you bar is the
payoffs to not you write the other
person yeah that makes sense although I
like that use the bar because that means
complement singly complement each other
isn't nothing to do with me he said you
it has something to do with you okay now
you're just confusing me with your
program all right sorry so I should have
called the other matrix I no way that's
that's not gonna help all right so so
the general some game that we're
actually solving here is you you bar and
why don't we just computes a Nash
equilibrium of that general some game
well there's a bunch of reasons one is
that they're hard to compute another is
that maybe they would they it would be
indifferent to getting those extra
bananas and sharing them around right so
what we're going to do is we're going to
define the cocoa value we're going to
use the cocoa value to actually divide
the spoils so here's how the cocoa value
is defined we're going to take the
general some game u u bar and we're
going to turn it into so redistribute
all those utilities that are in those
two matrices to create two matrices one
that's purely cooperative and one that's
purely competitive we're gonna we're
gonna create one game by thinking about
the average values that the two of us
would get for each of the different
possible joint actions sure right so
imagine that we would just get whatever
we get and then we split it evenly okay
all right that's very cooperative it was
very close and in fact mathematically
it's just you + u bar over 2 it becomes
the matrix payoff that we're both going
to abide by it seems reasonable purely
competitive version is for us to look at
the difference between the utilities
that we get and split that in half
alright so it ought to be the case that
if we add these two matrices together
you + u bar over 2 and u minus u bar
over 2 we get well we get you from my
perspective I'm sorry from use
perspective mm-hmm and we get u bar from
the perspective of the other player so
we get we recover those same utilities
from from the general some game mm-hmm
but we've you know again we've
redistribute them into these two
matrices one of which is purely
cooperative we get the same payoffs and
the other one is pretty competitive
because one of us is playing u minus u
bar over 2 and the others playing the
negation of that which is u bar minus U
over 2 alright so so what's good for you
is bad for the other player and vice
versa ok in particular this is zero sum
game now writes in fact I was actually
going to ask what would happen if you
were playing a zero-sum game then u + u
bar would always be zero and in fact
this would say you should do minimax on
the gap you + u bar would always be zero
yeah once we've redistributed these into
a new you and you bar yes and so right
and so what's the right what's the Nash
like thing with the equilibrium like
thing to do when we're playing a purely
competitive game and that's to take
minimax so we're actually going to
compute the minimax value of that game
mm-hmm and we're going to compute the
maxi max value in other words the which
cell has the highest some payoff or
average you say summin averages the same
mm-hmm find the cell that has that the
largest thing and say okay well that's
the that is also a Nash equilibrium of
the purely cooperative game because if
we if we choose the square that has the
highest payoff out of everything then
we're going to have no incentive to
switch to something else that's right
how do we compute the co-operative
equilibrium you just replace all the
things with their sum and take the
biggest one so it's like taking a max of
all the cells of the matrix the max of
all the of the new sales of the minute
the new matrix that's right and what
about minimax um gonna wait you not
remember how to do that though I do I
just I try to remember which one is
which um you just well let's pretend i
don't remember to do it anything it's
not a dynamic program is linear program
I'm truer words have never been spoken
because it's all about programming all
right so in particular you can set this
this problem up as linear program and
solve it in polynomial time so this is
efficient at least you know in a formal
mathematical computer science I kind of
sense and so is this right so we took a
game that we actually don't know how to
solve because computing a Nash
equilibrium can be really hard and we've
broken up into two again just by
redistributing the wealth redistributing
the utilities we actually split it up
into two games that are the same amount
of utility is being spread around but
we can actually compute the equilibrium
value for both of them really easily and
then we're just going to add them
together okay and then what are the
tools to do good question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
