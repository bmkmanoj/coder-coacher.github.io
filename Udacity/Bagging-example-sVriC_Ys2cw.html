we're going to create a bunch of one
nearest neighbor models we first have to
select randomly some of our data to go
into the first bag so I'm going to
circle some of these points randomly
that represent the data for our first
model so we randomly selected some of
these points now let's show what that
model looks like so this is zig zagging
orange line here represents what that
one nearest neighbor model would look
like and yes to me it looks like it's
overfitting but that's just our first
model then we draw some more data and we
have another model so our other model
model too is somewhat overfitting as
well but let's consider now a ensemble
model where we combine the results of
these two and at each point where we
query remember what we do is we take the
mean of the two models so you can see
already as this blue curve is a bit more
smooth than the individual models we're
beginning to get something better but
let's add some more models so I've drawn
over here a couple more one nearest
neighbor models and you can see each one
of them individually sort of over fit
but if we now sample at each individual
spot across here and take the average
across all of them we get something
that's much more smooth so here's what
our ensemble looks like and as you can
see it's much more smooth
of course I hand drew it so you could
accuse me of smoothing it by hand it was
at the point here is that you can build
an ensemble that is much more smooth
than any of the individual learners by
themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
