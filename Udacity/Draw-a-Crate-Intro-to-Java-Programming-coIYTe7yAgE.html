figure out exactly what each of these
corners is so that I can think about
what the end points of each of the lines
I need to draw are this line is pretty
easy it goes from 20 30 to 50 10 this
one's a little bit trickier this point
is that the same height as that one so
it's at 10 and it's 100 to the right
from 50 that means that it's x-value is
matching up with this one so that looks
good this point is 100 over from this
one so 100 plus 20 and this point gives
us 120 30 and this point is 40 down from
this one so 120 and 70 so we've got that
first line now this second one is from
50 10 to 150 10 this line it's 120 30 to
150 10 this line it's 150 10 to 150 50
in this line is 120 70 to 150 50 the
rectangle has its top left point here
and it gives us the width and the height
so we know how to specify that one
here's how I wrote the code to draw the
crate there's a rectangle which is that
front face top left 20 30 width 100
height 40 then there's that leftmost
line 20 30 to match the point that it
starts up in 50 10 to match the point
that it ends at then I did the same
thing with the top line the middle line
the rightmost line and the bottom one
then I had to remember to draw each of
these lines and if I run this program it
draws the three dimensional creeks that
I wanted good work if you got that that
was a lot of getting all of the right
coordinates in place but if you did that
you should be pretty familiar with
drawing lines now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
