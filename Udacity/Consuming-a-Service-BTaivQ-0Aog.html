hyphen in them so let's name the
component order tracker while we're here
let's create the service too and let's
call it order manager the order manager
service needs to keep track of the
active day we'll have the active day
default the to Monday the service will
also need to manage the orders that have
been placed I've created a menu
selection object that will hold the
orders for each day so this is the data
that the service will need to manage now
we need to give it some way to update
this data the service needs to be able
to change which is the selected day it
also needs to add an item to the
selected day's meal and then it needs to
be able to remove an item from the menu
remember that we're extending the
service class with an object so inside a
function we can't directly access one of
the data properties instead we have to
use embers this get to access a property
or this dot set to change it here we
have the ordered tracker component and
its template file we want the template
to be able to use this data so we need
to make a connection between the
component and the service we use ember
to get the service and stored in the
order manager object it's all very
readable we inject this service into
this component and refer to it by this
name now in the order tracker template
we want our users to know which day
they're picking food for so we reference
the order manager object and then the
select add a property off of the service
now let's add this component to the
application template and while we're
here let's change the heading to make it
something more exciting I had to restart
the server on the terminal for the
changes to take effect so if you don't
see the data from your service make sure
to restart the server and here's the
order tracker template that's pulling
the data from the service we also want
to display the menu item that's been
ordered for each day so let's add that
to the template we need to display
entries for every meal so I've added
breakfast lunch and dinner we want this
information for each day so we need to
loop over the list of days let's use
embers each inhale / to loop over the
days storing the key as day in the days
order as menu order let's use these
variables to print out the day and the
chosen menu item for me
so here we're printing out the day and
here are the menu items for breakfast
lunch and dinner and there we go we're
showing a meal time for each day now to
add a button to each menu item so we can
select it for a specific day and meal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
