that the answer 7 but this would be a
mistake we know that the square root of
5 is really just a number so we have
seven times one number minus one times
another number so if we have seven of
one number and we subtract one of that
number then we'll have six of that
number left this is why this answer is
really six times the square root of five
if we think about factoring of square
root of 5 from both of these terms we
would be left with the quantity of 7
minus 1 times the square root of 5 and
when we subtract will get six times root
5 another way to think about this
reasoning is with an object if you
thought the answer was seven then
consider this if we had seven cakes and
subtracted a cake we wouldn't be left
with seven cakes we'd really be left
with six cakes this is sort of an
analogy for what's going on here we have
seven cakes or root 5 s minus 1 cake or
1 root 5 this leaves us left with six or
five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
