the square root of two we multiply the
square root of two by the square root of
two we get the number two we know this
is true since we can rewrite this as the
square root of two squared we use our
knowledge of fractional exponents to
rewrite this radical as two to the one
half we're raising a power to a power so
we multiply these exponents together to
get two times one-half or 2/2 this
leaves us with two to the one which is
simply too now we're not so much
interested in multiplication of radicals
right now will learn that later but what
we are interested in is the square root
of two this is an irrational number and
the irrational number is a number that
doesn't terminate it means that whatever
is after the decimal never ends the
square root of two is about 1.4 but
that's just an approximation this
decimal actually has an infinite number
of places following the decimal point it
goes on forever so when we think about
irrational numbers we're just thinking
about numbers that can't be written as a
fraction it's not important to plug a
number like the square root of two into
your calculator since we really only get
an approximation of that answer
throughout the rest of this unit we
won't be working with these crazy
decimals instead we'll just write the
radical symbol and the number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
