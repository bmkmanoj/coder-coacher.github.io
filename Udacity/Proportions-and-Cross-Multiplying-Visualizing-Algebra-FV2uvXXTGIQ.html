setting up a proportion we can compare
the number of dimes and quarters in the
ratio to the number of dimes and
quarters in our hand when we set two
ratios equal we get a proportion the
number of Dimes in our ratio was 24 hour
ratio we have two to three or two thirds
and in our hand we had ten dimes and I
did know the number of quarters so I'm
going to use a variable Q once a
proportion is set up we can solve for
unknown amounts using cross
multiplication this method comes from
multiplying both sides of the equation
by the denominators notice 3/3 makes one
so i'm left with 2 q on this side and q
divided by Q makes one as well so i'm
left with 3 times 10 or 30 on this side
we could have gotten to this step a lot
quicker if we would have just crossed
multiplied 3 times 10 is 30 and Q times
two is to Q we would get this equation
we want to be careful when we cross
multiply we can only do it when there's
one entire fraction on the left and on
the right if there's other sums or
differences you should try something
else and then to find the number of
quarters we divide by two so the number
of quarters is 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
