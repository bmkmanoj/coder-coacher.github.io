scene starting first with computers and
then actually moving to consoles of
course with it became larger asset sizes
as well as increased load times see the
medium of actually getting data off of a
cd-rom was much slower than cartridge
counterparts were for earlier game
systems this mean for the first time in
history game developers were actually
forcing users to stare at a very very
boring screen that just told him content
was loading this of course was because
the assets took time to get into memory
and they weren't being streamed off of a
disk fast enough more importantly game
developers didn't really have the proper
knowledge of how to work around this
problem most of the architectures back
then were single threaded which means
all of the file i/o was actually
synchronous or blocking so they had to
come up with very very tricky mechanisms
to load data and render that little you
I now for grits we run into the same
problem if a user's on a very very slow
connection it's actually going to take a
lot of time to stream that data in for
our purposes we actually employ an
asynchronous asset loading methodology
which means we can actually render
things to the screen will actually
pulling data in from the net and that's
what we're going to talk about here in
just a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
