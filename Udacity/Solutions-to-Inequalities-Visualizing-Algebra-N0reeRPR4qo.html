from the last problem we know that here
we had an equal sign last time so when
this was equal X had to be too so there
is one solution but we don't have an
equal sign here we have an inequality
sign so I want this right side to be
larger than eight if X was too I get
eight so that means if X was any number
bigger than 2 then this side would be
larger than 8 i'm going to try plugging
in 3 if i plug in 3 i get 9 plus two on
the right so 8 is less than 11 this is
great this is a solution that works and
in fact any number bigger than 3 would
give me a number larger than eight when
i plug in so there's got to be more than
one solution there's not just one or two
there's infinitely many there's more
than three if you chose this one nice
work you might be skeptical just looking
at this one solution let me show you for
when i plug in for i get 8 is less than
12 plus 2 or 8 is less than 14 plugging
in any number bigger than to like three
four five or even 500 would work that's
why there's infinitely many solutions
