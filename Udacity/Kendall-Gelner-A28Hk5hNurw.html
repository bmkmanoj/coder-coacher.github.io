developer at Udacity and we're here
today with a Kimble can will you please
introduce yourself sure my name is
Kendall Gilmer i'm an independent iOS
developer based in denver colorado i
have my own small company called Giggy
software and i do just iphone and ipad
development for a variety of different
kinds of companies and what brought you
to iOS development ah well actually was
right around the time really a few
months before the launch of the App
Store I had been kind of playing around
with Mac development for a little while
but I when I first got the iphone i just
i really knew that that was going to be
a big thing like i just could see that
in my head that apps would be amazing
for that and i actually fortuitously got
laid off for my corporate IT job just
like maybe six or seven months before
the apps were and at that point i just
decided to take the time after i get
laid off to just shift all efforts to
really learning iphone development and
so I did that and I actually released an
app on the launch of the App Store and
that's how i got into ice development to
start with it and almost immediately
after i shifted to consulting but I was
you know that I just kind of jump
started myself that way and what was
that first app that you built it was
called check out smart shop actually and
so it was an app that let you scan and
barcodes it would look on amazon or
Target or other kind of local places and
decide and help you decide if a product
maybe was around somewhere close to you
or if it was better to get three amazon
so it was kind of an initial early
shopping of and what you did is
something that many wannabe iOS
developers are planning to do or wish to
do what advice would you give to someone
that wants to go solo or become an indie
developer yeah it's definitely a bit
harder today especially product wise
look if you're trying to develop a
product like that's a much harder road
to go then then going in through
consulting and that's what i would say
because even now i really don't have
products anymore and I'd really just do
consulting work and I would say if
you're going to try and do products you
might want to start with consulting
actually to see what's That's Life
working through companies or how it is
that they
build applications of what they do to
really make application is really nice
and then from there if you have good
product ideas you can try launching them
kind of on the side or or just at least
have more of a base of understanding to
really get into how to properly prepare
for a good launch for an application
I've been an indie developer in the past
and I made a mistake that I fear that
many developers do they want to go indie
because i want to just code and i
thought what's going to happen you will
spend a lot more time doing marketing
right though and that's especially true
i think now with the way the App Store
is I think there's actually a lot of
potential still for App Store revenue
and independent developers but now more
than ever marketing is really a key
strategy of that you can't just rely
there's so many apps you people will
never find you alone and that's where
marketing and some advertising and just
kind of things like that are really
crucial and so that and that's also
reason why I say maybe getting into
consulting because then you start by
learning to sell yourself a little bit
and you learn what marketing is just in
relation to your own services and then
you can extend that knowledge to maybe
an application that you want to build or
maybe getting a marketing partners right
or maybe finding good marketing partners
right or other good people to help you
cut it with a business out and if you
could go back in time and meet the your
own self when you were starting with iOS
development we do you have any tips for
that developer ah you know actually I
was honestly very pleased with how
things kind of turned out i think i
would say that it would have been nicer
at that time to focus more on product
development a bit more i wish i had
stuck with the product stuff a bit
longer and not so immediately moved in
consulting at that point but but like i
said at this point i don't know that
that's really practical so much so but
but that's what i would have said to
myself back then because that was kind
of a key position to be and it was a
really good moment to really be building
products because there was a wide field
and it was not a lot of people in it yet
so and there's probably still true in
other parts of the app store just not
overall so okay and if one of our
students is a
interested in going the consulting way
you have any tips how to sell yourself
look for first client well ironically I
mean it does help to have your own app
so even if you you might think about
working on some kind of a starting app
and even maybe if it's not quite good
enough for the app store or something
just to have an app that you could you
know distribute to someone as a way of
example is saying oh you know I did this
and I've worked on these kinds of things
I think that's a big help or may be
contributing to some open source
frameworks but basically I think just
the idea of building a you know a usable
application start to finish that maybe
uses some data and other sort of more
common frame works with in iOS would be
a really good way to kind of edge into
consulting and then from there you have
something to show that you really can do
what you're pleased and having uh so
basically you're saying have a portfolio
of a sample apps that you can show to
write is exactly that would be the thing
is cut yeah kind of like a portfolio app
maybe with even different segments
showing off different things that you've
learned with development or just or or
like I said even just like a finished
application is especially valuable just
to show that you you know you can really
build something start to finish and you
kind of know the whole span of iOS
development especially because things
like provisioning and other aspects of
iOS development are kind of quirky and
if you know those you're actually ahead
of the game of a lot of people that
that's too much trouble to learn so and
talking about provisioning what you
think is the toughest part from in iOS
development what's the less pleasant I
would I mean definitely provisioning is
right up there especially for someone
fresh into it and even myself I
encounter many frustrations with that
over time apart from that you know
really really that's one of the main
things but also just tooling can get
frustrating to sometimes Xcode will
crash or cause of their problems and
another thing to be wary of that is
actually that there are a lot of
third-party frameworks and things that
will help you build stuff but if you
rely on them too much you don't really
understand well what is going on and so
that's actually kind of a danger it's
not really as much of a thing that makes
it hard as sa provisioning profiles
which are just naturally hard
kind of stumble you stumble on the right
off the bat but they're the kind of
thing that later on down the road you
just won't know something as well
because maybe you used a third-party
framework to help you and accomplish
something so knowing how the underlined
stuff works and then maybe using a
third-party framework on top of that
once you understand how things work i
think is actually very important i think
that's that's great advice to our
students having the whole frameworks
that apple provides us is enough of a
black box and you shouldn't be blindly
adding stuff that you don't understand
how it works i got into that trouble in
the past it was horrible oh it's
something that you you really need to
pay attention to don't add stuff that
you don't understand right completely
talking about tools and frameworks or is
there anyone that you would specifically
recommend to our students uh you've been
in terms of in terms of following or
like the research or know something that
you use and you think it's a lousy here
oh right so actually yes there's one
thing which is there's a very nice code
generator which I normally I'd never
would use a code generator but for core
data I make an exception and there's
this really nice code generator called
mo gin oh yeah mojet oh yeah so mojet
has just been invaluable really to me
over time because Apple even has gotten
better they have tools and Xcode to
generate poor data objects for you but
even so there's just some things that mo
gin sort of builds for you at our gate
and it's flexible it has a templating
system and you can configure what it's
actually producing it I think that will
become important as Swift kind of rises
and people maybe want to tinker with
what kinds of you know template
templated kind of objects coordinated
generates but in a swift standpoint
actually I think it will be a little bit
of a nice thing as a transition happens
to make it easier on you and so that
that's the main one actually is I'd you
use that all the time there's other
there's other things like like actually
the scope software scope X or
no but it's a basically a screen
measurement software that helps you that
helps you measure pixels exact pixels on
screen currently I mean of course sketch
is kind of the most useful sort of
graphical design things so that's also a
pretty good tool for iOS development now
so if you can get a little bit of
knowledge of that will help you work
with designers too and so that's pretty
important but basically just even
understanding xcode and instruments it's
kind of really important and a lot of
people don't really go into depth as
much as they could understanding just
those tools and understanding those two
really well helps you a ton especially
instruments actually in analysis and
things so yeah since we got away from
manual memory management people I never
forgot about instruments because they
don't need it right as you don't need it
every day every day but when you need it
you really really need it right that's
definitely a great tip learn instruments
directly and talking about design you
mentioned something about design you
work with that designer how do you
commonly yes I mean I've since I worked
with a lot of different companies they
all have different approaches I mean
some have in-house designers sometimes
on a small project i'll just be paired
with another designer but i do work with
a lot of different design pretty much in
every project there's there's going to
be a designer working with you and
helping to build the app also so there's
a tool called paint code right pink oh
yes I've used that too that's also
graded so just in case it's a it's a
tool that allows you to design something
and instead of giving you an image it
gives you code that will create that
image so it's a tell my students it's
either paint code or pain code because
riot in core graphics that's true for
doing core graphic stuff that's
especially invaluable when you're trying
to get something more dynamic and you
want some initial code to help you build
up some complex graphic and then you can
kind of manipulate it from there but
it's really great at kind of generating
code for you like that and what kind of
app so do you usually work on what
what's the usual domain they're mostly
kind of business to customer focused
kinds of things we have worked with
larger consulting companies on sort of
more mainstream sports applications
and currently I have a client that's
doing really an enterprise-level kind of
store supplier to store sales
application and I'm also working right
now also with a signature analysis
application and just a wide variety of
stuff basically the only thing kind of
thing I would say I don't really work on
much as games that's the one area that's
pretty specialized and so I just have it
look at that as much but every other
area I've kind of done some things in at
least here they're different frameworks
and everything okay and if you were
talking to someone who's just beginning
right now what are the the tools the
frameworks or technologies that you
consider that are a must you must know
this if you want to become a senior iOS
developers well that's your career sure
so I've been right off the bat core data
is super important it's very complex and
it can be very frustrating but if you
just understand that well that will be a
big help and lots of companies do use
core data especially enterprise or
consulting kind of companies people that
use consultants are often using Core
Data I would say there are other
frameworks but to understand core data
first even helps you understand why
those other frameworks are valuable for
you too and so that that's the main one
the other ones you know actually really
a lot of people especially bully more
professional apps now are very focused
on good animations and that kinds of
things so really core graphics and core
animation and just learning generally
how to work with animation within your
application to just kind of fine tune
how things shift around or how they
present themselves initially that can be
very useful to that we very valuable
experience to a lot of companies and
that is actually something that a lot of
more advanced developers would look for
is kind of proof that you understand the
animation system and maybe you can do
some more advanced things so that's also
very helpful some of the other
frameworks that are useful like core
location is pretty nice to know but not
used by everyone the actually the
networking stack is very useful like the
CF networking and just the the
nsurlconnection and that kind of an
nsurl session especially its we're more
modern approach to that and to
understand nsurl session is great
because that's where that's an area
where
prior to the really nsurl session a lot
of people used other third-party
frameworks is your networking in iOS
that's not really true anymore and so
you should really I think sere away from
third-party frameworks at the moment for
networking kind of stuff and really just
figure out aniseed recession and how to
use that for almost anything you want to
do on top of that the biggest one is
really just some kind of JSON working
with JSON and server api's is super
important because almost everything now
has some degree of interaction with some
kind of server or stuff on the cloud and
so understanding JSON and how to work
with that data coming into and out of
the app is very important i'd say that's
the other one as for languages are you
more of a Objective C or Swift kind of
guy where do currently I really work in
both it's interesting actually my large
enterprise client than working with
currently they actually shifted to Swift
almost immediately after Swift was
launched and so now I work with Swift
almost all the time I still work with an
objective-c to some degree kind of a
mixture back and forth and actually some
calling each other but I definitely
would say you know Swift is definitely
the future in the same way that you
could look at auto layout before a while
ago and say well you know that's that's
pretty nice but it's not really working
that great but to learn it at that point
was super important because Apple just
keeps on pushing basically and apples
direction is on a way out so it was
really good to learn how to lay out
because now you know it's more settled
and everyone uses it or well maybe not
everyone but it's it's very popular down
and in the same way as Swift I mean you
can just tell apples moving everything
that way there will still be a lot of
objective-c stuff for a long time and
actually I love the language i really
love objective-c but i also love Swift
it's okay to love more than one language
you I mean just even beyond that there's
many other languages I'm very fond of
and just you know remember that all
languages have their they're good and
downsize and just kind of learn what is
good in each and but really is right now
for iOS development especially Swift
focus as I think very important as for
the double DC considering what we've
seen so far what do you think is more
exciting or more important at this point
well what I'm really excited by is not
just any one announcement but sort of
the cloud of announcements around
extensions I really think that it's
great that Apple is opening up even more
the system and I think that will really
change a lot more how people kind of
work with the applications I mean
especially using I message was you know
all these different messaging
applications and it opens up some
possibilities for kinds of applications
that really couldn't necessarily be done
before because of people's reluctance to
use third-party apps for you know just
going to an app to do one task but now
within you know some of the stock apple
apps you'll be able to do some tasks
that you just wouldn't been able to
directly there before that opens up I
think the greatest possibility and it is
the most interesting aspect to me is
just what is possible with these many
new extensions that are now available
and would you recommend a beginner
developer to attend double-double DC
alcohol or any technical conference I
actually the technical conferences are
great because you meet so many people
that do different things and they're
especially great and understanding how
people do things w and each is different
kind of in their own way they're useful
like wwc is nice to hear the way that
Apple you know kind of recommends that
you go and that's good to hear because
in the future that those are always kind
of hints as to where Apple's headed and
they could help you understand sort of
how to better prepare for the future in
other conferences like all can't or just
other general third-party iOS
conferences are great because you get
speakers that are you know really
seasoned and how to use the frameworks
as they are so you get an understanding
of just the best practices of how people
are using what exists today and is so
it's actually kind of nice to meld the
two like it's really super important to
watch the WC videos to understand the
future but then to understand the
present and then to kind of mingle those
two together i think is great and I'm
especially happy that so many
conferences now they have videos all
over I mean it's just really easy to get
a lot of great content from all over now
when you develop an app for klein most
applications right now and need some
kind of server side or back in you also
do that part do you use a i used to do
that part but i have that for a while i
actually probably will now that server
side Swift has become more available
just because i have done a lot of job on
the past and i was able to do that but
just because there was so much demand
for iOS development and on teams i've
generally been partitioned out into
doing you know kind of more client side
work and I have worked closely with
server-side developers because I
understood well how to build the server
api's and everything and just kinds of
things that the mobile client would need
to have the API work better with it but
I just I haven't had for a couple of
years really the chance to work on the
server aspect but but definitely was
Swift going in now especially more of
like cloudkit things that help you
manage some of the server things that
you might have done otherwise before
there's a lot of different ways now that
even an independent developer working
one thing can really have a server
component that does meaningful things I
think specially if you have the same
language from top to bottom right that
does help I be like I said I enjoy using
multiple languages but definitely uh you
know context switching is hard and if
you can use one language for all those
things that it is nice and so and I
think Swift is actually very applicable
to server side work too it's a little
bit early so it's the kind of rough to
use it that way but I think it that
swift language is also a pretty good one
for server development too okay so you
think that's the skill that will be
marketable in the future I think
eventually that might take a few years
but I do think that's a possible future
right is just even Swift server
developer could be you know like an area
of focus that would have some potential
what's the biggest advantage of
attending a technical conference such as
alcohol wdc what would you recommend our
students sorry well really the
differences between something like dub
dub and something like alcott for other
third-party iOS conferences is that WBC
is kind of the future of iOS development
its kind of showing you where Apple's
headed and so that's important to know
where something like all cough or other
ayahs conferences there's they're giving
you seasoned developers viewpoints on
how to use what Apple already has in
place and the great thing is now is that
really almost all these conferences are
presenting videos online and so it's
very easy for students they don't have
to you know if they can't afford to go
to conference or it's just not practical
for them to travel somewhere then it's
very easy now especially WBC is live
streaming and they have videos after but
almost all the smaller conferences now
have another it all come for example is
recording all the sessions and you can
watch them later and so you can get all
of the conference material now just at
home and it's a tremendous wealth of
information now that
was hard to get before you didn't have
to go to conferences and now any student
can go and find just a ton of good
information so yeah so you can get all
the information but if possible I would
recommend actually attending because
there is also the networking part that
it that's true it and there's yeah there
is a lot of networking involved so if
possible it is great to come to
something you meet a lot of interesting
people from all over and you find out
more about talking to them about how
they work on things and it gives you an
even broader scope of understanding of
just what people are doing these days in
different application development so
that part is very useful as well that's
true so if possible it is good to go to
a conference but if you can't there you
know at least yo have at least you can
do a lot of learning and and you know
kind of do good all that way so and just
a last question do you have any favorite
apps something that you use everyday
well let's see here I actually use ways
all the way time for driving as a
driving assistant I love that thing I
have to say I do you slack all a lot
because I want a lot of different teams
and so something like slack is very
useful to me to kind of keep track of
what is going on within different teams
apart from that I use a variety of
different photography apps I enjoy
photography and I like using a little
bit some of the more advanced photo apps
so just kind of here in there and well
thank you very much and thank you for
well that give this ravelry so you and
it's always a pleasure to meet another
mo generator fan oh yes because I'm a
rabid fan of so yeah that's been helpful
for so long I really really appreciate
what that is helping so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
