pictures is to tell a story to
communicate don't try to win an art
contest don't try to win a photography
contest don't have artistic lighting
that puts some things in shadow or in
the dark we want to show the design
features what's really important for the
designer to understand your for you to
tell the story to your audience
so let's Sega let's take a look
here's a picture of a train station I
wanted to show that accidental social
cues can serve as signifiers you know
when you rush to the train platform how
do you know if you missed the train well
there are people waiting you probably
didn't miss it if it's empty
oops maybe you did so to tell this story
I had to get to the train platform long
before the train was scheduled to arrive
carefully leaned against the post I
wasn't going to change my position and
take pictures as the people arrived more
and more pictures because I didn't know
when the train would come when the train
finally came I then waited until the
train left and the platform was empty
and I took the last picture was it worth
it yes to tell the story the destination
control elevator took a lot of pictures
and some editing and even adding a label
to understand the picture the photos
took a lot of work was a photo
application because I had to crop the
photos so you could put them together
properly and I cropped the photo so what
I wanted to show the controls you saw
only the control and nothing else that
was distracting so four different
pictures to tell the story but once
again it was worth it sometimes a single
photo is enough to make the point you
don't always have to have a sequence of
photos so here's one a picture of push
and pull doors same hardware and both
doors yet one is push and one is pull I
cropped the original photograph and I
darken the glass so the objects behind
the window we're not as visible that's
okay to do it would not be ethical to
fake it to put objects in that really
weren't in the scene or to take away
things that we
we were present</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
