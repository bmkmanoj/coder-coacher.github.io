now a bit bigger remember that the input
was a double quote followed by a less
than sign what we get in the end is the
output which is just the less than sign
in the dynamic trace we can now begin
follow back the dependencies for
instance from out out being read here
where was it last written that's over
here so this depends on this earlier
statement here we have out that's being
read know in the dynamic trace you can
actually follow the salt thing and see
where it was last written again which is
up here and here we have the character
see which stems from the second
iteration of the for loop and this
relates to s which depends on the input
so again we have a chain of dependencies
out going up here up here up here up
here and you can also see this as a
cause-effect chain s had this value
therefore C became a less than sign
which was added to out which finally
resulted in the input also having a less
than sign again we can use these
dependencies to build a slice however
now the slice would be a dynamic slice
because it is built on the dynamic trace
starting with e assert statement we see
that out equals out plus C is being
executed and therefore part of our slice
we see that the initialization about is
part of a slice we see that the for loop
is part of our slice and of course when
we call remove HTML markup where s is
being said this also becomes part of our
dynamic slice so far we only looked at
dynamic data dependencies but of course
there's also the name control
dependencies every condition that gets
evaluated that is executed and controls
whether a statement in question is
executed or not build a dynamic control
dependency therefore since we execute
out equals L plus C the controlling
conditions are also part of the dynamic
slice from these conditions we again get
or dynamic data dependencies which you
can look up again in our dynamic trace
for instance here the tag variable which
is being read over here was last set up
here therefore this condition is data
dependent on this initialization so
here's a quiz which other statements in
the program are also part of the dynamic
slice is it code equals false is it tag
is set to true is it tag set to false or
is it quote is set to not quote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
