from sentence I can get to subject verb
1 possible subject is students one
possible verb is think we saw this one
before this is definitely in the
language of the grammar however students
teachers is not that's two subjects in a
row and there's just no way to get there
starting from sentence we can turn
sentence we can rewrite it into subject
followed by verb so we can match
students at the beginning but teachers
is not a verb it's just no way to make
this happen students right this is one
of our subjects this is one of our verbs
that looks good teachers think teachers
think that's a subject followed by a
verb that looks good teachers right and
also looks good think right this is two
verbs and our rules up here say a
sentence has to be a subject followed by
a verb this just doesn't match the
pattern and in fact in this particular
grammar these four are all of the
strings in the grammar there are only
four possibilities this grammar is
perhaps not super exciting but we're
going to get to something many things
much more exciting than this in just a
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
