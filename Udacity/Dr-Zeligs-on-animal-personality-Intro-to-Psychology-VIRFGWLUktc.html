learning we talked with dr. zelich's she
took some time out to talk with us about
animals and personalities so before I
move forward let's take a look at what
she had to say about the personalities
of some of the animals that she's worked
with so some people are surprised to
know that animals have distinct
personalities and you have a ton of
experience with animals so can you tell
us a little bit about your experience
with their personalities now what's
amazing is animals run the same gambit
of personalities as you see with human
beings you have animals who are really
excited and engaged in task driven you
have animals who are really relaxation
driven who like to sit back and enjoy
and be quiet
you know what motivates someone runs
across the gambit of things so some are
are motivated by curiosity and some are
motivated by food and some are motivated
by activity and all of these things make
up some what inspires and then what
makes up their personality what what
attracts their attention and what kinds
of things they choose to engage in so
Saki the sea lion is one of the most
focused working women I have ever met in
my life and she would like to just have
her job going on 12 to 14 hours a day
and as long as we can focus on making
sure she's a star 12 to 14 now she's a
diva that that's her her the best life
in the world for her calli on the other
hand is a little bit more cuddly she's a
little bit more playful she's not so
much about needing to do a task as she
is just being she's got that
relationship thing she really wants to
be with her best friends and that's kind
of what motivates her what kind of
things they do when like if Saki is not
working what does she do when she wants
to be working like this she try to get
your attention or yeah Saki will will do
all kinds of behaviors to try to get
your attention and she'll also take out
her frustration on her environment when
it's not going her way she's got that
real diva thing you know so she'll take
your toys and eat them side to side burn
it burn it why isn't it my turn to be
paid attention to
she'll give herself a job by swimming
really frantically or doing spectacular
jobs or
you know trying to keep herself busy
she's she's definitely not a couch
potato animal and then on the other hand
I've known loads of animals that will
just sit back and relax and chill out
when when it's not their turn they're
perfectly fine with that how about any
other types of animals other than sea
lions it's the same I mean I can't say
I've ever worked with an amoeba but even
the unquote lesser animals that I've
worked with even fish that I have
trained have distinct personality some
of them want to hover over here and like
this kind of security and feel like they
need security and others of them are
extroverted and are very attentive and
curious and that that's with monkeys
with tortoises with otters with
everything that you can imagine they
have just a different natural set of
ways of interacting with their
environment and you see it in terms of
whether they act out on their
environment or whether they're more wary
how playful they are how active they are
what kinds of things they like and don't
like so where you see the most extreme
of personality as the long-lived super
social animals and so that's because
Natural History's sort of require the
most complexity in order to work with
their world their broad social world is
a big component of it so that's where
you see that just the most diversity of
less less programming and more learning
from the environment as what what's
going on and you see the sort of the
LEAs personality and the animals that
have a much more fixed action pattern
type of life history so a snake or a
lesser bird but even in those you'll see
preferences and attitudes towards
collecting prey you know certain snakes
will need it to move and other snakes
don't really care and you know what they
like the warm rock but as long as it's
high up here or that you know so there's
there's all of that and and it goes
across the animal spectrum for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
