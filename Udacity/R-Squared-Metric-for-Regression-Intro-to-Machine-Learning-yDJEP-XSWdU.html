this shortcoming is called r-squared and
is a very popular evaluation metric for
describing the goodness of fit of a
linear regression and what r-squared is
is it's a number that effectively
answers the question how much of my
change in the output is explained by the
change in my input and the values that
are squared can take on will be between
0 and 1 if the number is very small that
generally means that your regression
line isn't doing a good job of capturing
the trend and the data on the other hand
if R squared is large close to 1 what
that means is your regression line is
doing a good job of describing the
relationship between your input or your
X variable and your output or your Y
variable remember this is the whole
point of performing a regression is to
come up with a mathematical formula that
describes this relationship so if your
r-squared is close to 1 it basically
means your fit is doing a good job the
good thing about r-squared is that it's
independent of the number of training
points so it'll always be between 0 1 in
general is not affected by the number of
points in your data set so this is a
little bit more reliable than a sum of
squared errors especially if the number
of points in the data set could
potentially be changing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
