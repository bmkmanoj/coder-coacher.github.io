of what the good guys have to do first
of all we have to worry about what we
call prevention prevention really is
keeping the bad guys out of our systems
well the bad guys are the threat sources
they're going to try to attack our
system if we can keep them out that is
prevention
unfortunately prevention it's not going
to be a hundred percent if that happens
we want to detect the compromised as
quickly as possible people talk about
grants persistent threats or a PT's that
go undetected for a long time that means
we don't have good systems to detect
that kind of malicious activity well if
you find out that they have breached our
systems or compromised them then we have
to respond to that so response comes
next and what do we need to do as part
of the response we need to recover from
whatever that has happened if data was
corrupted maybe we have to restore it
and things like that and then
remediation basically has to be that the
same attack should not happen again
all these things is what good guys have
to do so really two parts to sort of how
do you do that how do you do detection
how do you do remediation and what
exactly needs to be done so mechanism is
sort of the hull part you want to have a
flexible set of mechanisms so policy is
always what is the way in which we're
going to address something and what's
done is through this whole spectrum
cybersecurity again not going to be
hundred percent secure ever but that
doesn't mean that we leave the door wide
open so that's what good guys have to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
