transformations let's look at that in a
little bit of an interesting way here's
my equation we know how to look at that
of course we basically talked about that
now a simple way to do would be is in
this case I can come up with four
parameters and sometimes for example a
could be the scale and Y and D could be
the scale the for example the numbers
negative kind of give it a flip forces
not
and similarly things like C and B kind
of give you the shear information and
again mixtures of this with sines and
cosines tell us how to do rotations so
what interesting to notice all of this
means is we are only looking at linear
combinations of these parameters to
generate a newer set of x and y's given
an x and y so x and y x-prime y-prime
are computed knowing what x and y are
and again if i know the parameters ABCD
let's look at some of the features or
the kind of the details of what these
types of things provide they can be used
to generate scaling of images rotation
of images shear and of course also
mirroring we've looked at all of them so
far now let's look at some properties of
these linear transformations one thing
note is all of the time the origin still
remains where it is at 0 0 we haven't
actually done so far any translation for
example right I gave you this example of
looking at these matrices where we just
played around with how to change them to
do scaling rotation sheer scale we
haven't actually done translation so
origin remains where it is always second
thing to note in all of this it would be
that lines would actually generate lines
again so if the image had aligned the
same straight line would actually be
generated in the new image even with
scaling of course it might look
different in terms of it might be
stretched because we may have stretched
the image more and why in Lesson X or
something like that or it might get
flipped when I do the mirror but it
still appear as a straight line all
parallel lines because of the fact that
everything is straight line will also
appear as a parallel and the new image
and all ratios would actually be
preserved as much as possible on that
