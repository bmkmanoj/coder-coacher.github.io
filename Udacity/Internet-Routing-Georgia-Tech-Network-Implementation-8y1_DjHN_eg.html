routing contrary to what you might think
the Internet is not a single network but
rather a collection of tens of thousands
of independently operated networks or
autonomous systems sometimes simply
called a esses networks such as Comcast
Georgia Tech and Google are different
types of autonomous systems an
autonomous system might be an internet
service provider a content provider a
campus network or any other
independently operated network now when
you're sitting at home on Comcast and
trying to reach content in Google or
Georgia Tech your traffic actually
traverses multiple autonomous systems
this process of internet routing
actually involves two distinct types of
routing one is intradomain routing which
is the process by which traffic is
routed inside any single autonomous
system
the other is inter-domain routing which
is the process of routing traffic
between autonomous systems so computing
a path between a node in an ISP like
Comcast and another node in a network
like georgia tech's involves computation
of both intra domain paths and inter
domain paths in this part of the lesson
we'll look at intradomain routing then
we'll study intradomain routing as well
as the business relationships that make
inter domain routing so complicated so
let's jump into our study of intradomain
routing and topology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
