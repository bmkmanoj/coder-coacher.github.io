key suppliers there are two types of key
suppliers one which you actually
outsource part of your company to a
third party it might be your accounting
functions it might be some of your sales
it might be something as simple as
doctors looking at x-rays are now done
by trained technicians in India it might
be part of your supply chain for sub
assemblies or you might outsource your
entire manufacturing line which we used
to have here in the United States to a
third-party company much like Apple does
with Foxconn or your key suppliers might
be traditional direct suppliers they
share simply ship you components raw
materials iron ore for you to make steel
etc in the old days we used to think of
suppliers is not a partnership but just
simply a cost of goods nowadays we
understand to get the most efficient use
of out of our resources we really need a
relationship that treats them like
partners we both need to be in this to
win we both need to understand that this
is more than just a financial
transaction so as your startup grows
start looking for partners and where you
are more than just a checklist and and
they're just more of a source of
material and try to establish long and
lasting relationships</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
