think for x1 it's kind of very clear
that this variable actually has to be
set to true and the reason is the
following if you look at all of the
clauses here they are connected by ants
so if one of these clauses here becomes
false the whole boolean formula here is
also set to false now here x1 is in a
very lonely position so to say because
x1 makes up a whole clause so if we set
x 12 false then this formula here the
whole formula here will also become
false so it's clear that x1 has to be
set to true and it's also easy to see
that because the variable just appears
once and this can be done in polynomial
time it's it's rather easy because you
just go through the sole boolean formula
here or an algorithm could do it then it
finds a clause with just one variable
and it knows if you have a class with
just one variable then it's immediately
here how you have to set this so for
example if we had not x1 here we would
also know that we would have to set it
to false so what's the other variable
where I think that it's rather easy to
see if it should be set to true or false
well x2 if you look around it so here's
X 2 here's not x2 not x2 not x2 so it
appears a couple of times it appears as
x2 and as not x2 so without trying any
other assignments I think it's not that
easy to see x3 is the same so here we
have x3 here we have not x3 here again
we have x3 not x3 that's also not easy
to see so what about x4 well the thing
with x4 is this variable appears only
once namely here there's no x4 anywhere
else and that is why in my opinion is
very easy to see what to do with X for
the thing that makes SAT hard is when
variables appear in different forms
right so so it appears here as x1 and
here it appears as not x1 so if we set x
12 true this clause here becomes
satisfied but we get one less variable
to satisfy the clause over here and vice
versa if we set x 12 false then this
clause here becomes satisfied but we get
one less variable over here because x1
is now set to false so we have to either
set X 3 to 2
or x52 true so if a variable appears to
us once we have nothing to lose we can
just set x 42 true satisfying this
clause here and it has no secondary
effects on any of the other closet and
of course an algorithm could also do
this very easily the algorithm just
looks at each variable and counts how
often does that variable appear and if a
variable appears just once it knows how
to set it so here we have X 4 we would
set it to true if we had not x 4 we
would set it to false so let's try a bit
more challenging example actually we
have found two very easy pre-processing
rules for sat if there's a class with
just a single variable and of course if
the boolean formula is written in
conjunctive normal form then we know how
to set that variable and second
pre-processing rule that we found out
4x4 if a variable just appears once in a
whole formula then we also know how to
set that variable so now let me give you
one more example which is going to be a
bit more challenging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
