but really difficult are you telling me
I have to write a bunch of new features
ah the cool thing about support vector
machines is that you don't there's
something called the kernel trick so are
you going to explain the kernel trick to
us I bet you are
no evolved video just give you the gist
of it they have functions that take a
low dimensional input space of feature
space and map it to a very high
dimensional space so that what used to
be not linearly separable and turn this
into a separable problem and without
going to any detail these functions are
called kernels and I encourage you to
check out on this these aren't just
function over the feature space these
are functions over two inputs and when
you apply the kernel trick to change
your inputs based on X Y to a much
larger input space separate the data
point using support vector machines and
then take the solution and go back to
the original space you now have a
nonlinear separation and this is the
really cool thing about support vector
machines you can take a very simple idea
of finding the best linear separator or
linear line between different classes
apply what's called the kernel trick in
a high dimensional space and what you
effectively get is a very very powerful
system to set data sets apart where the
division line might be nonlinear that is
really cool and one of the most central
tricks in all of machine learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
