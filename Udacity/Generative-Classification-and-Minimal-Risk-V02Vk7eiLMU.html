said we needed to know two things one is
we need these loss functions we need
these costs all right somebody has to
tell me because I can't know that it's
not defined intrinsically in the data
it's the cost of you know either
societal costs economic costs you know
whatever as I said before the cost of
somebody calling somebody stupid it was
really smart and large might be much
worse than the cost of calling
somebody's smart who's actually stupid
in large think about that okay the basic
idea is that the costs come from outside
the data but the other thing that I need
is that I actually need to know the
probability that something really is a
forgiven some measurement the
probability that really is a nine given
some measurement right we need to be
able to evaluate those the way we did
that if you recall is that we we talked
about estimating the likelihood that's
the probability of the measurement given
that it's here we were doing skin colors
given that it's a 49 or given that its
skin or not skin and then how did we go
from likelihoods to actual probabilities
posteriors well remember we used Bayes
rule okay and Bayes rule would allow us
to take these likelihoods right to
probability of getting the measurement
given the class skin etc multiply that
by this prior just what's the
probability of getting a four or nine or
in this case of getting a pixel being
skinned or getting a pixel not being
skinned and you multiply them and you
have to normalize them and you get this
posterior which was the thing you wanted
okay and that's what this equation down
here says the probability of skin given
X proportional to P of x given skin the
likelihood times the prior and of course
then the question came up of where does
that prior come from and again we had to
learn it somehow from training data so
we showed an example this is from Gary
Brodsky of classifying skin color at the
end of the day you would basically take
this value and you would compare it to
some threshold and you would say okay if
it's higher than the threshold I'm going
to call it skin otherwise it's not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
