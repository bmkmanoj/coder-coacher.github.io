three kinds of view we can take with
regards to running time we can take a
best-case view and assume that all the
inputs that we're getting are the ones
that make our algorithm run the fastest
or we can take the very opposite view
and say that the running time of our
algorithm is going to be determined by
the worst possible input that it can
receive or we can define running time as
the average time that our algorithm will
take over a number of inputs so which
one of the three are we going to choose
in this course best case running time as
you've seen in the previous quiz is
often rather trivial or meaningless so
for example if we use best case running
time for our algorithm that counts the
number of days it would only be valid
for Strings that contain no a at all so
we're not going to take this for the
average case view actually that could be
a very interesting view and practice
because when we run the algorithm a
couple of times we might not care about
how much that algorithm runs on a single
run but over many inputs but as you've
just seen in the quiz it's actually
quite hard to define what an average
input looks like and also when we do the
analysis of an algorithm sometimes we
might not even know what kinds of input
the algorithm receives so average case
analysis is very interesting sometimes
but here it's actually not that suitable
now worst case analysis where we always
assume that the algorithm receives an
input that makes it run as long as
possible might seem a bit pessimistic to
you it's almost like we had a mean
adversary who was trying to give us the
worst possible inputs but on the other
hand the advantage of worst-case
analysis is that it offers guarantees
what I mean by that is when we take a
worst-case view we know that our
algorithm will not run longer than the
worst-case analysis suggests no matter
what happens and this is actually what
we're interested in in this course so we
are going to use worst-case analysis
meaning we're always going to state the
time of our algorithm for the worst
possible input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
