constraint that is a single property of
the system which must always hold okay
it happens to be an invariant as
indicated by the inv keyword one thing
that I've glossed over is the fact that
we use the numbers two and three
explicitly without any indication that
they're their dates now that can be
inferred from the type of check out but
if we were to get this completely right
we'd have to make sure that all the
types matched up and in fact we were
talking about two weeks here or three
weeks here we do have a date class but
we have to make sure that we're using it
appropriately each ocl constraint it's
interpreted in the context of a
particular class what that means is that
any names that occur without
qualification that means without having
only a single part without any period in
there are interpreted in the context of
a particular class and what that means
is that the name could be the name of
the class it could be the name of an
attribute or it could be the name of an
operation we're also allowed within the
language to refer to elements of other
classes and in that case we're going to
have to explicitly named the class and
then put a period separator and then the
name of the attribute or the name of the
operation and the other class those are
qualified names but if we're doing it in
if we're referring two names that belong
with a class itself we don't have to
which is why we had the context keyword
this particular constraint is
conditional it says that for each book
object if the bestseller attribute of
that object is true then the checkout
period attribute for that object must
have the value of two denoting two weeks
otherwise the checkout period attribute
must have the value of three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
