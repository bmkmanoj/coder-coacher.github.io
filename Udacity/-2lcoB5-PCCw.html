important to create apps that are smart
about using a device's memory resources
so now let's discuss one way to do this
by implementing an efficient memory
strategy to display a long list of data
which many mobile apps will need to do
so this strategy is called view
recycling which means reusing views that
are no longer visible on the screen
anymore and by the way when I say view I
mean the whole layout for a single row
the layout for a single row is probably
created by a view group so something
like a linear layout or a relative
layout which can contain multiple views
however a view group is just a view
itself and you may hear us refer to the
layout of a single row just as a view
now the Miwok language is really big and
one way to go about creating the app is
we could create tens of thousands of
list items and add them to a vertical in
your layout but if you have that many
vocabulary words it can become really
slow to scroll through the entire list
and the device could crash because it
can't hold all these list items in
memory now remember memory is a limited
resource and the Android system and
other apps needs some memory to keep
running as well now there's a more
efficient way to do this using the
ListView and array adapter we can create
just enough views meaning list item rows
based on what we need to fill up the
screen this means if we scroll upwards
we no longer need to see the views at
the bottom of the screen so let's just
focus on the ListView and array adapter
structure now furthermore we can recycle
views this means if a view is no longer
visible on screen we can reuse it by
changing the data so changing out the
data inside the view such as the text in
a text view changing out the image in an
image view and we don't have to waste
time creating the entire view from
scratch again now we take these extra
views and put them in a scrap pile that
can be recycled and reused and another
term you may hear people refer to them
by is scrap views so we keep a scrap
pile which is a bunch of views that
aren't currently being shown on the
screen right now available for reuse
later so recycling so to get into more
details of how recycling works say for
example the user is scrolling the screen
so they want to go to the top of the
list to see the latest new tweets
or news feed stories now the ListView
realizes it needs to create more or less
item rows quickly so when the user
Scrolls it seems like the list items
were there just all along and now
instead of creating a new list item from
scratch you can just reuse it from the
scrap pile if they exist so to summarize
we created more rows on demand by
reusing views in the scrap pile and then
it just becomes a matter of changing the
data inside the views so it shows the
correct information for that list item
now the ListView is also smart enough to
know that the views that were at the
bottom of the screen have been scrolled
off the screen and these views are no
longer visible to the user so they can
just be added to the scrap pile and as
the user Scrolls even farther up the
list we can use that list item row that
used to be at the bottom of the screen
now at the top of the screen so the goal
of all this is to create as few list
items as possible because it's expensive
to inflate views from XML to Java
objects and how to prove to you that
viewer cycling minimizes memory usage
I've prepared two versions of the app
one in the current state of the app
that's using a vertical linear layout
with one text view per list item and a
second version of the app using the
ListView and array adapter so the memory
monitor tool is included in Android
studio to help you look at the amount of
resources that your app is using so
professional developers use this tool to
help them identify ways that they can
minimize resource usage on their app the
difference in memory usage between using
a linear layout and ListView and array
adapter becomes more noticeable when the
number of list items increases so Albany
demoing these two examples so that each
one displays a list of 1,000 words now
here I am an Android studio looking at
the linear layout version of the app and
notice that in the numbers activity it's
displaying a list of 1,000 words and
here's what the app will look like when
we run it on a device so tapping into
the numbers activity displays our long
list of words now with our device
connected to the computer we can run the
memory monitor to check the memory usage
of this app but before I can run it I'll
need to go up here to tools Android
enable ADB integration so ADB here
stands for Android debug bridge so the
connection between our device and
Android studio so once that's enabled go
down here to Android monitor in the run
time window click it open and I'm gonna
pull it up and then click here on the
memory tab so this screen will allow me
to view the memory usage of my app over
time so I'm gonna go ahead and run the
app on our device alright so with our
device connected we see the memory
monitor running and we can see the
amount of allocated memory used to just
display the list of categories so I put
up what the screen looks like on our
device now and let's see what happens to
the emulator when I tap into the numbers
activity Wow
notice that jump right there so went
from around 2 megabytes to about 14
megabytes so is this increase this jump
in allocated memory considered good or
is it not so good well the best way to
check is to run a different version of
the code on the same device so we're
gonna be running it on the same device
because it has a controlled set of
resources now to do that I'm gonna hop
on over to a new version of a code
that's using the ListView and array
adapter to display the same list of
1,000 words now here I am looking at the
ListView and array adapter version of
the code and it's also displaying that
same list of 1,000 words and now let's
take a look at what it looks like when
we run this code on our device so the
category screen looks the same but when
we tap into the numbers activity notice
that the list of 1,000 words appears but
with dividers and so we'll talk more
about how and why this works later on
now back in Android studio I'm gonna
launch the memory monitor the same way I
did earlier so down to Android monitor
here pull it up and then go to the
memory tab so notice that the memory
monitor ran after my device was
connected because ADB was enabled and
the amount of allocated memory stays
constant when I'm on the category screen
now notice what happens when I tap into
the numbers activity
so notice that slight jump there so the
number one from about twelve point seven
one to about twelve point eight four so
that's fairly point one megabyte
increase in memory going from the
category screen into the numbers
activity so this time the amount of
memory used to display the list of
numbers was a lot smaller than when we
use the linear layout version of the
code and since we're using a smaller
amount of memory this version of the
code using the ListView and array
adapter will run more smoothly on
lower-end devices now let's take a look
closer into the memory monitor here so
it's actually showing us two things so
the dark blue section is the allocated
memory which is the memory our device is
using at any given time and this light
blue section here is the free memory so
that's the memory available on the
device while I may be tempting to use up
all the free memory on your device to
make your app look a little cooler
remember that your app isn't the only
one installed on a user's device and
it's important to leave as much
resources for other apps as you can now
here are two screenshots from the memory
monitor for our two versions of the app
so this left side here is the version 1
of the app using the linear layout and
the right-hand side here is version 2 of
the app using ListView and array adapter
remember that the allocated memory is
shown in the dark blue section and the
free memory is shown in the light blue
section notice that in both cases the
jump to an allocated memory occurs when
the user clicks on the numbers category
to navigate to that list of numbers
words so let's zoom into the linear
layout version of the app and we see the
jump occurs from about 11 megabytes to
about 14 megabytes so this is about a 3
megabyte uses of memory used to display
that list of 1000 words now compare this
to when we use the list view and array
adapter and it's barely using point 5
megabytes to display an entire list of
1000 words so after seeing these two
examples I like you to check out the
links below to learn more about using
the memory monitor tool and other ways
that you can improve your apps
