denormalize the shopping lists well you
were working on that I made two new
screens for sharing let me show you what
they look like you might have remembered
the sharing flow from when I mentioned
it before so you have some list open
let's say a generic grocery list and you
can click the share icon the share icon
will take you to the new share list
activity that I've created for you here
you'll see a list of your friends and if
you want to add a new friend you can
click the add new friend button this
takes you to the add friend activity
which has a list of all users in the app
if you want to add one of them as a
friend you simply need to click their
email address and you'll be taken back
to the share list activity with the new
friend added things get more complicated
when you actually want to start sharing
the lists with these friends but for now
let's start with just this share list
add friend activity interaction all that
I want is for you to make it so when you
click add friend you see a list of users
you could select the user and then they
end up here in the share list right now
display the list of all users in the app
should be pretty straightforward after
all you know how to use firebase list
adapter x' and you have a location in
your firebase database that contains a
list of all users but what about this
list of friends here remember that our
database design included a node called
user friends which up until now I
haven't talked much about let's take a
look at that node in the database design
schema so here's the database design
that we're going for and we can see the
user friends node here if we expand it
you'll see that we're gonna have a list
of user emails for every user that has
friends there'll be a list and then
under each user email there'll be a list
of friend emails you can go ahead and
put an entire user object here so that
you'll have access to the users name so
getting that list of users that you need
to show the sharing screen is this
simple as at actually ulster here to the
encoded email of the user that you're
interested in okay I'm excited for you
to add these new screens and I'm sending
over the exact specifications and the
code for the new screens now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
