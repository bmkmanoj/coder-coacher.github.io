write a really good random test case
generator is that we can be overwhelmed
by the success of our own bug finding
effort at some level we should be so
lucky to have this problem but on the
other hand if you take a large software
project that's never been subjected to
random testing and hit it with a
sophisticated random tester it's not at
all unexpected that you'll be
overwhelmed by the number of bugs so
what happened is to start a random
testing around you will leave for the
weekend and next time you come in there
might be 250 bugs so the way we would
have visualized the situation is like
this so we have the input domain of
course and all I'm going to show here is
inputs of found bugs so there's a bunch
of them no we have is sort of a
fundamental quandary which is the
question do we have 250 test inputs with
all for one reason or another all happen
the map to the same buggy output or on
the other hand do we have a situation
where we found perhaps 250 different
bugs and without looking in more detail
what's going on there's no way we can
tell so most likely so almost certainly
the truth is in the middle almost
certainly we found 10 bugs or maybe 50
bugs but we probably didn't get so lucky
as to find 250 bugs and we probably
weren't so unlucky has to trigger the
same bug 250 times although of course
that kind of thing does happen and so
they're basically two ways out of this
problem first solution pick a bug and
report it it's totally the relevant
which bug it is it could be a random bug
and all most likely what we'd sort of
want to do is I ball them a little bit
somehow and see which one seems the most
serious it doesn't matter let's say we
report this test case here that goes to
our developers and what they're going to
do is fix it of course so this buggy
part of the of the output space goes
away in the next version of the system
so now we don't have range of the system
we have range prime which is just the
range of the next version and so we
still have exactly the same input space
and the behavior of the software under
test has changed a little bit and now
something interesting happens not only
did that particular failure go away but
perhaps some of the other ones did so
perhaps all of these over here stopped
being inputs that trigger failures
anymore of course that's great because
it's nice to see that they fixed a bug
to cover such a large part of the input
space on the other hand another
possibility is all the remaining bug
triggering inputs that we found still
trigger bugs and so what do we do well
of course we just go ahead and report
another bug and the strategy will keep
working as soon as we get a new version
of the system that fixes a bug reported
we can just do another one so this isn't
a bad mode of operation and what this
works for is basically for smallish
systems where bugs can be fixed rather
quickly there's no problem at all
reporting one bug at a time on the other
hand if the people fixing by
have a slow fixed cycle so let's say
we're only testing actual released
versions of microsoft word for example
we're only getting a new version every
couple of years so if they fix one bug
in Microsoft Word every couple of years
the question is how long do we think
that'll take for them to arrive at a
correct version of Microsoft Word an
answer of course is they never will
because they're putting bugs in faster
than we would take them out using a one
bug at a time sort of a model this can
easily be the case for real software
products so if that's the situation if
reporting one bug at a time doesn't work
we're forced to use a different strategy
and I call that bug triage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
