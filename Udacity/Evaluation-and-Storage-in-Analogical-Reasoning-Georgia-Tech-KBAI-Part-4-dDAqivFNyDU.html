storage this evaluation and storage
steps an analogical reasoning very
similar to the evaluation and storage
steps and case-based reasoning
analogical reasoning by itself does not
provide guarantees of correctness so the
solution that it proposes must be
evaluated by some manner for the dunker
addiction problem for example we may
evaluate the proposed solution we're
doing a simulation once the evaluation
has been done then the new problem and
it's solution can be encapsulated as a
new case and stood back in memory for
later potential reuse to return to the
dunker radiation problem as an example
once we have the solution of decomposing
the laser beam into several smaller
beams and sending them to tumor at the
same time from different directions we
can do a simulation of the solution and
see whether it's successful if it is
then we can encapsulate the target
problem in the proposed solution as a
case and stood it in memory it might be
useful later it could potentially become
a source case for a new target problem
to come later once again in this way the
AI agent learns incremental e each time
it's also problem the new problem in a
solution becomes a case for later reuse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
