first you'll need to implement get low
score position implement it so that it
only looks through the data once and
remembers the position of the low score
as well as the score itself to implement
get low score index will follow the
algorithm we talked about earlier for
finding the first portrait in the
picture gallery but this time we're
using it on a partially filled array
instead of an ArrayList so we have to be
more careful we'll start by assuming
that the lowest score is the first one
then we'll look at all of the items
starting at one because we already
looked at 0 now for each of those
elements will compare it to the lowest
score and if it's smaller we change what
we think the lowest score is now while
we're looking for the lowest score we
also need to look for its index so
initially we assumed that the lowest
score index with 0 and when we find a
lower score will update the lowest score
index to be the index of that score now
when we finish looking at everything the
lowest score index that we found so far
will be the overall lowest score index
now that I have this method the simpler
version of removing the minimum score
will work I'll test it so I can be sure
and it looks like it correctly dropped
