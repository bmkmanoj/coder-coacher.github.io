position 3 when the mass is way back
here is far away from equilibrium as
it's going to go it has only potential
energy all that energy is stored in the
spring for an instant the block stops
moving before it changes direction
making the kinetic energy zero lets him
to position one next well here the
spring isn't stretched at all it's at
equilibrium x is 0 so there can be any
potential energy so what happened to all
the potential energy that was stored in
the spring back here well it must have
been converted to kinetic energy a
position to midway between positions 1
and 3 I know the springs stretched
somewhat so it has potential energy but
it's not stretched as much as it was at
position 3 so some of that potential
energy must have also been converted to
the energy of motion kinetic energy so
these are the answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
