psychologists would suggest that you not
helping the person was due to what we
termed diffusion of responsibility and
this just states that when many people
are present we are less likely to help
now I mentioned earlier that in addition
to this research many researchers have
looked at bystander effect and they have
found that there are some variables that
actually influence whether we are more
likely or less likely to help besides
just a number of people present some of
the variables and situations they looked
at in regards to bystander effect and
diffusion of responsibility have been
emergencies versus non-emergencies
they've looked at the ambiguity and
consequences of the situation they've
looked at priming by the bystander so
for example the bystander may attempt to
get eye contact with a participant
they've also looked at cohesiveness and
group membership and finally they looked
at personality and background there are
lots of studies on the bystander effect
but now let's go back to Lauren and talk
a little bit more about how we assess
whether or not we should get involved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
