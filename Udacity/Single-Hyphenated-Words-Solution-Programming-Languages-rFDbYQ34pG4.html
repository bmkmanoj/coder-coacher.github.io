we're going to test our ability to use
the or operator and the ability to group
regular expressions and here we're going
to write a regular expression that
matches two types of words normal words
such as Alice and Bob and also those
with a single heighten such as super
urban we however won't perfectly match a
string such as super mega urban so we
need to write a regular expression that
perfectly matches Alice Bob super urban
but doesn't match super mega urban well
one way to think about it is we have two
types of regular expressions one that
matches normal words or one that matches
a word with a single - let's do one at a
time first let's do the one that matches
a normal word this regular expression
will match one or more occurrences of
lowercase letters okay let's move on to
the single hyphenated words a single
hyphenated word has three parts a word a
hyphen and another word so here I match
a word a hyphen and then another word so
really I want any match either of these
in order to do this I'm gonna have to
group them and Python we group them
using parentheses and don't forget the
silly question mark colon notation as
well and here we go as a regular
expression notice that I listed the
hyphenated words first because the way
find all works is that it first checks
to see if this matches the left side of
the or operator and then the right side
and if I'm running find all I'd rather
have it return the hyphenated word super
Irvan instead of first checking if the
word match is just super then seeing
that - doesn't match anything and then
returning urban I'd rather get the whole
thing super urban</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
