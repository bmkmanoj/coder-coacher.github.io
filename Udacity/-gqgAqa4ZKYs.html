to add and work with user interface
elements in iOS you're going to build
the first part of the pitch perfect cap
with the ability to add buttons and
connect those buttons to code in your
app I'm going to be working with two
parts of the MVC diagram the view and
the controller our controller is called
a view controller and the view for now
is just called the view we won't see the
code behind the view classes just yet as
we're going to be using the view classes
that apple provides namely uiview UI
label and UI button recall that the
controller part of the MVC pattern is
where we handle events from the view and
we're going to be using the view
controller that Xcode has already
started for us the view controller dot
Swift class this is where the code which
will be called by the buttons will
reside at the moment our view controller
is just named view controller but in a
later lesson we'll rename it to
something more meaningful record view
controller user interfaces are one of
the key ways your users will interact
with your app let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
