that you would know enough to contribute
to the educational technology community
what's the loaning outcome learning
outcome is something demonstrable I've
to learn and go with something you
should nobody into the course I'll
learning outcome is something you should
be able to do and here the learning
outcome is a subtle twist on that
learning goal if the goal is to know
enough to contribute the outcome is that
you will have actually contributed now
of course the way you contribute is
dependent on your interests or your
passions in this class for example if
you're more interested in designing
educational technology than your
contribution your learning outcome will
be that you have actually designed
educational technology if you're
interested in is more on the research
side then by the end of this course your
outcome will be you have done research
you have actually participated in
researching educational technology and
made a contribution to the research
community so depending on your interests
the nature of your learning outcomes
will differ but the overall outcome is
the same for everybody by the end of
this class you should be able to and in
fact you will have contributed to the
educational technology community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
