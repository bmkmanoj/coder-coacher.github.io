is a firebase engineer at Google who
will hopefully be able to help me with a
security issues that I'm having with my
app let's try yes so let me explain a
little bit about what's going on so I
basically have two issues that are very
interconnected and they all boil down to
the fact that i'm using the user's email
is basically in place of their your ID
so the first thing that we do in the app
is when they sign up with an email and
password I have this really nice flow
where I basically use firebases reset
password functionality to make sure that
the user actually owns the email that
they say that they do but I realized
when I was writing the security rules
that if somebody isn't using my client
app and there instead either just you
know writing their own JavaScript or
using a badly made up of some other
variety that they could get around this
you know flow that I've this really nice
load that I've set up so I realize
there's no way they're really trust that
the email the user owns the email that
they said they do and then on top of
that I've got the email basically
everywhere in the security rules and I
just don't know you know how secure that
is how to make that secure in the
security rules so you are a security
rules guru can you help me ooh that
sounds to it like a good challenge okay
let's take it one step at a time okay so
the first thing is indeed your email
verification flow right because um you
are using firebase is reset password
flow which is great and it's a great use
of that flow in your Android app but the
problem that you run into now is that
since the code runs in on the user's
phone in their android app you have to
trust the user to write back their email
address into the database at the end
that is where you now have a security
problem is that correct yes I mean if
they're using the app things should be
fine but if they're not using the app if
they just write their own JavaScript
exactly so and this is what we see very
very often with developers that are
using firebase you want to trust that
it's your coat modifying the database
but there's really since firebase is a
cloud-based database there is no way to
be guaranteed that it's your coat
that's writing the only thing you know
is which user is writing to that
database and that's what you see with
the Android app right you can verify
that it's the user that signed into the
Android app that is writing the email
address and you can do the same no
matter if they wrote their own Android
app or even if they were using a
JavaScript client you can verify that
it's dead you said that's writing the
email address what you can even validate
is that what they're writing is an email
address you can validate that there's a
in there right you can validate or
validate the value but you cannot verify
that it's actually the correct email
address that that's where your yeah
essentially losing the security battle
yeah and we're I mean we're doing that
type of stuff for validating that it
looks like an email address so basically
what I'm hearing is that it is either
very hard or impossible to do this kind
of stuff on the client side or with the
security rules is that true yeah the
problem indeed is that you must verify
the email address in an environment that
you trust and you should not trust the
users android phone okay so the only
option there is actually to take the
same flow that you have on the phone and
move it to a trusted environment and
typically then you you think of a server
right where you essentially take the
same flow and you run through it so the
user right you sent them in an email
with a password reset type thing in
there essentially a shared secret and
they can only validate that they own
that email address by typing that secret
code into some interface that you define
the flow is exactly what you do today
the difference is that it now runs on an
environment that you can trust and that
that means that it runs under somebody
else's identity so that's also how you
secure this flow in the security rules
is that you verify that it's written
from a trusted identity and not from
just the user that is using running the
appellees android phone so I really like
what you're saying that basically the
flow itself doesn't have to change we
can probably use at least similar code
to what we already have the thing that
makes me nervous is when you say a
server so how you know sort of
heavyweight are we talking
about you know what would I need to do
to set up something like this yeah and
this is a very common question we get on
firebase as soon as we mentioned running
server code this is not your typical
infrastructure server this is
essentially a trusted device that runs
the same type of code that you would run
on the android phone or on a web page
but it now runs in a trusted environment
so you could run this I always say that
a lot of my maintenance scripts run in
jsfiddle I'm not saying you should do
that but since I don't myself run these
are for my own research type databases
since dr's are not really production I
just run the maintenance whenever I feel
like it but it is trusted because only I
fxs 22 dissing for 2d scripts so only I
can run them just like that you could
run them on a small google compute
engine instance for example we're on an
ec2 instance and it can really be like
the smallest one you that you can get
there because you don't need to do a lot
of work or if you really want to you
could even run it on your own android
phone that's the exact same code it runs
on your phone and since it doesn't run
on my phone you know that you can trust
it interesting i guess i just have to
keep my android phone on all the time
yeah no that's the only thing you need
to do so I mean that doesn't sound like
the scary type of server I suppose but
you know we're kind of already the thick
of things are there any options for
working with out a server that could
still get us you know where we want to
go mm yeah this is this is going to get
more challenging so this is where you
need definitely to add some steps into
the current flow so right now the
problem that you have seems to be that
you trust that if two accounts have the
same email address written into their
profile data that it's the same user and
that those are the accounts that you
want to merge and this is something that
you should not do because right as we
covered before you cannot trust that the
email address they write is an email
address that they own as so you really
must find another way to get these
people to agree to merge these accounts
so a very common approach would be to
actually put an mutual agreement type of
flow in there so instead of merchant
accounts like you do now you actually
require that the user proposes to
merchant accounts and that then the
account that they want to merge into has
to accept that proposed merge and since
you already have a friends list you sort
of have the mechanism in place there to
identify which accounts you want to
merge so you don't even have to rely on
the image email address there you can
also have them select the accounts that
they want to merge into okay so a lot of
extra code of the client side is yes
definitely yeah so would besides adding
sort of bulk to the client side app with
this ad Eddie kind of bolt to the
security rules themselves or what would
that look like oh yeah definitely you
know you need to write some security
rules for like the place where these
users meet up and agree to merge their
accounts and I've written some examples
for that to essentially highlight how
that would work let's super helpful I
guess we'll take a look at those later
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
