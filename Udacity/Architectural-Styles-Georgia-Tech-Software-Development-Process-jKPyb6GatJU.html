lesson is architectural styles so let's
see what those architectural styles are
there are certain design choices that
when applied in a given context
regularly result in solutions with
superior properties what that means is
that compared to other possible
alternatives these solutions are more
elegant effective efficient dependable
evolvable scalable and so on
architectural styles capture exactly
these solutions they capture items that
we can use when designing a system for a
more formal definition let's look at how
Mary Shaw and David garland define an
architectural style they say that an
architectural style defines a family of
systems in terms of the pattern of
structural organization a vocabulary of
components and connectors and
constraints on how these components and
connectors can be combined so in summary
we can say that an architectural style
is a named collection of architectural
design decisions applicable in a given
context and I want to stress that it is
important to study and know these
architectural styles for several reasons
because knowing them allows us to avoid
reinventing the wheel it also allows us
to choose the right solution to a known
problem and in some cases it even allows
us to move on and discover even more
advanced tiles if we know the basic ones
so we should be familiar with
architectural styles what they are and
in which context they work and in which
context they do not work so as to be
able to apply them in the right
situations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
