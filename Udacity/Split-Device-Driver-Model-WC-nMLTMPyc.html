is the so-called split device driver
model this model is called split because
all of the device accesses are
controlled in a way that involves both a
component that resides in the guest
virtual machine and also a component
that resides in the hypervisor layer
specifically device accesses are
controlled using a device driver that
sits in the guest VM called the front
end device driver and then the actual
driver for the physical device that is
the regular device driver that's used by
operating systems when they run natively
in this back and Driver Weaver test back
end resides in the service vm in the
case where we have a virtualization
model that involves a service vm or the
host operating system in the case of
type 2 virtualization the point is that
this back-end should really be just the
regular device driver that the service
the Linux OS for instance in the service
vm would just be able to install and use
even if it's not running in a
virtualized environment now although
this back-end driver does not
necessarily have to be modified the
front end driver has to be modified
because it explicitly needs to take the
device operations that are made by the
applications in the gas and then put
them together in something that looks
like a a special message that will
directly be passed to this back-end
component that's in the service the end
so this approach essentially applies
only to para virtualized guess that will
be able to explicitly install these
special front end device drivers with
these really are they look like wrappers
for the actual device API so the
applications potentially they don't have
to be modified they will continue making
the same kinds of requests for device
operations but this front end device
driver will treat these operations
especially will not attempt to actual
issue accesses to the physical device
instead will create messages that will
get passed to the service vm one benefit
of the
approach is that it can eliminate at the
overheads that are associated with
device simulation that the previous
model required now we don't have to
reverse engineer exactly what the guest
OS is trying to do the guest OS via its
front end device driver explicitly tells
the virtualization layer so overall
these two components what exactly is it
that the guest VM requires another more
subtle benefit of the approach is that
now that we have this back-end component
that's centralized in that it will
accept requests from all of the guests
VMs in the system and then try to decide
which one of those gets to execute the
physical device access and there are
some opportunities for some better
management of the shared device accesses
so to enforce some finer grain policies
regarding fairness regarding priorities
and those sorts of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
