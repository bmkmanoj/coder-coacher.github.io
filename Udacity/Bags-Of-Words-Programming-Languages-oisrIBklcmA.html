last exciting episode we learned how to
take a string or a sentence and use
lexical analysis to break it down into a
list of tokens or words and lexical
analysis was based on our old best
friends regular expressions
remember that we need to break down HTML
or JavaScript source code into tokens
and then into valid utterances in order
to understand them and build our web
browser however it turns out that just
having a list of tokens or a list of
words is not enough we could still be
confused for example I've written here
two collections of words the first
Simone de Beauvoir wrote the mandarins
and the second wrote wrote Simone Dada
even though this second collection of
words uses only words that occur in the
first we like this one and this one
makes us very confused
so just the list of words isn't enough
they have to adhere to a valid structure
there's a subject and a verb and an
object and down here in bag of words too
it's not really clear what's going on in
particular we're tempted to say that bag
of words number one Simone de Beauvoir
wrote the mandarins follows English
grammar follows the rules of how we
construct sentences or thoughts in
English and the second does not the
grammar for any modern natural language
be it Mandarin Chinese English French
admits an infinite number of utterances
but not and this is super critical
not all utterances all interesting
grammars rule something out provide
structure by saying that you can't say
gibberish you have to say something
meaningful so despite the fact that
we're going to rule out quite a few bags
of words we're still going to have
plenty of room for creativity and you'll
see how in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
