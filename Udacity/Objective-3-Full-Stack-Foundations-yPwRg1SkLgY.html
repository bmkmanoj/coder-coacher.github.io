together this objective really has three
parts first we need to create a link to
make a new restaurant then create a page
to handle the get request when we click
on that link and finally a get post
method to persist the data to the
database well the first part doesn't
seem too hard let's add another anchor
tag to our restaurants page that prompts
the user to create a new restaurant
followed by a few break lines we can go
ahead and fill out this href - backslash
restaurants backslash new as stated in
the objective next I will create another
page to handle this new restaurant
request inside my do get block I will
add another if statement that looks for
the backslash restaurants backslash new
URL looking at this code we can see a
lot of similarities with our previous do
gate if statements I have added here a
field where the user can input the name
of a new restaurant so now that the
layout is in place the magically happens
with our post request
unlike get requests post requests cannot
be executed by simply typing a URL in a
browser and hitting Enter however do
posts is going to look for the backslash
restaurants backslash new path passed
along from my forum in order to know
what action to perform inside my do post
I will comment out the previous code
inside the try block for now I then add
an if statement looking for backslash
restaurants backslash new then I extract
the information from the forum similarly
to the way I did it in the first web
server we wrote but this time I
incorporate that data into my
declaration of a new restaurant class
also differently now instead of printing
my results to the current web page I
create a redirect here that will take me
back to my original restaurants home
page let's save and restart our server
again if we can create a new restaurant
and see it added to our page objective 3
is over and out the source code for
objective 3 is available in the
instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
