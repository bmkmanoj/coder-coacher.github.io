doesn't assign streams at all so none of
these operations declare a stream and
therefore they're all in the default
stream and since they're in the same
stream each one must complete before the
next one in that stream is allowed to
run so could a min copy will run for one
second
Colonel a will launch and run for one
second and CUDA memin other-- second
will copy the memory down do some
operation on it copy the memory backup
and after three seconds the results will
be ready for the hosts this next code
snippet does declare a stream it puts
them all in s1 and so since all three
operations are in the same stream the
previous operation must complete for the
next one can start so once again this
will take a second this will take a
second this will take a second and the
final result will be ready in three
seconds this one's a bit more
complicated here I'm doing two
operations on different chunks of memory
so I'm copying a char a one in 2d array
one calling kernel a on D array one and
copying D array one back to H or a one
and then I'm copying H or a to 2d array
to doing some operation on D array to
with the by launch and kernel B and
copying DeRay to back to HR a - so the
first three operations are in stream one
so kudamon copy async will be called and
it'll start a memory copy to happen on
the GPU and then CPU execution will
continue the next statement will happen
we don't we don't stop and wait for this
to copy to finish before we execute the
next statement which is a launch of
kernel a kernel launches are always
asynchronous so in effect this queues up
the launch of kernel a which will be run
on the GPU after this mem copy has
finished and it proceeds to the next
statement which is another kudamon copy
async to copy the results of kernel a
back onto the host all three of these
are in-stream ones they will all wait
for each other on the GPU but the host
just issues a command issues a command
issues a command it doesn't stop it
proceeds to khuddam mpa sync in s2 and
so now it starts another asynchronous
memory transfer this one because it's an
s2 doesn't have to wait for any of these
operations to complete so we get started
right away it'll complete in one second
it calls kernel be in one block of 192
threads also in s2
and then calls kudamon copy async again
and s22 copy the results back so the
first memory copy will happen
these next two operations and s1 will
get queued up and the next memory copy
will happen essentially immediately so
in the first second this mem copy and
this mem copy will be running in the
next second kernel a will be running in
kernel B will be running and in the
final second the return mem copy will be
running in s1 and the return copy will
be running in s2 and so the minimum
amount of time this can take if all of
the operations that can run concurrently
do run concurrently will again be three
seconds but in this three seconds we'll
have actually gotten twice as much work
done we've overlapped the execution here
and I phrased this very carefully when I
talked about the minimum time this is
going to take it's worth noting that
there's a lot of reasons why it might
not be able to overlap all of these
operations some older GPUs can't do this
many asynchronous mem copies at the same
time and I was pretty careful to launch
a single block so this probably will not
fill the GPU on the other hand if kernel
a had run tens of thousands of blocks it
might well fill up the GPU with those
blocks before kernel B got a chance to
start filling the GPU with any of its
blocks and so kernel B might end up
waiting on kernel a simply because
resources are not available to run it
the final example is the same operations
just reorganized so in this case we
issue both mem copies and stream one and
two both we launch both kernels and
stream one-and two-and we issue both min
copies back and stream one and two so
rearranging these things shouldn't make
a difference the minimum time that this
could take is still three seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
