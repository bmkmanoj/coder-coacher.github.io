let's talk about Newton's third law the
easiest way to remember this one is that
forces occur in equal and opposite pairs
now that's easy to say a little harder
to understand what it means the easiest
way to get a feel for what this means is
to go push on a wall and I mean it
really push on that wall what do you
feel well as you exert a force to the
left on the wall I'll call that the
force of you on the wall you can feel in
your hands that force pushing back call
that the force of the wall on you and
the amazing thing is every single force
in physics occurs in pairs like this
whenever there's a force of a on B
there's an equal but opposite direction
force of be on a now one of the really
amazing implications of this has to do
with objects in free fall if i look at
this object as its falling to the ground
i can draw a force diagram for it and if
we're ignoring air resistance the only
forces this downwards force of mg but
that's a lone force there's no partner
to it I thought forces always occurred
equal and opposite pairs well as a
matter of fact they do in fact this
forces the force of gravity we could
rephrase it as the force of Earth on the
ball f earth on ball there's actually a
corresponding upwards force of the ball
pulling on the earth and this is truly
amazing right now you are tugging on the
earth with a force exactly equal to your
weight pretty amazing and that is what
this next question deals with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
