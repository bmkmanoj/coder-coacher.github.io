actually kind of surprised you didn't
ask me is what's this rollout nonsense
oh I recognize that from reading about
TD gammon house it's a word actually
comes from an understanding of how
people figure out which back Emin boards
are better or worse they actually will
the rolling here is the rolling of the
backgammon dice hmm that's not at all
what I was thinking most what do you
think well I was just thinking that we
have some rollout policy which tells us
what to do when we're here and I said
well let's just act randomly I don't
know why that's the right thing to do I
mean if I end up here and I've got to do
something we're trying to get an
estimate of this state and taking this
particular action and ending up in this
state why is that good or bad and the
way you're gonna do it is I'm gonna say
well I know how good it is to be here by
behaving randomly from that point on I
mean that that will give you probably an
underestimate of the true value but it
would be nice if you could do something
that perhaps made a little more sense so
people who have done work on MCTS have
often put some effort into well lots of
things being clever about this expansion
keeping the right set of statistics kind
of you know shoving their exploration in
very smart ways but other people have
spent a little bit of effort trying to
figure out can I come up with a better
policy besides behaving randomly that
will help me to have a better estimate
of this particular Q value and we could
talk about it I'm going to just quickly
talk about one by mentioning something
that we have already talked about so far
in this lesson do you remember the
commands you came up with for pac-man oh
it was like eat eat eat avoid right so
they can eat little dots eat big dots
eat ghosts avoid right so I'm gonna
point out that of those four which I'll
just call eat eat eat and avoid which
one of those are different so I don't
know the first one eat where you're
eating bigdhaas yeah or small dots no I
guess I guess you want me to say avoid
because word that's different in the
list avoid is different but it's
actually different in a different way
here we said you know eat a little dot
eat a big dot eat agos and avoid ghosts
remember when I said before that you
know temporal distraction becomes goal
abstraction
I'm gonna claim that each of these does
have a goal one is to eat little dots
one is the big dots and one is the
little goblins but that when you execute
the eat small dot it actually terminates
at some point you eat a small dot and
now you can move on to the next thing at
some point you eat a large dot and now
you can move on to the next thing
at some point you eat goblin and then
you can move on to the next thing but
avoiding goblins avoiding ghosts that
isn't really something that ends you're
supposed to be avoiding ghosts all the
time I see well I guess it's sort of the
negation I I do understand how that's
different now so and eating the ghost
ends when you succeed avoiding I want to
say ends when you fail right right like
I'm avoiding the ghost of the oh right
so in fact these things have sort of
goals they have success conditions they
end when you succeed avoid is a little
different it sort of ends only when you
fail you can never succeed at avoiding
ghosts you can only fail at it in some
sense whereas here there's a sort of
finite time in which you you know you
achieve your goal and that success so it
turns out that when you ask people to
come up with these kinds of things they
you know these kinds of options they
actually come up with things that look
like this lots of goals with lots of
success metrics but they also come up
with things where you can sort of only
fail we actually have a word for that
and they're called constraints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
