to get a feel for what you can do in
continuous output spaces with machine
learning it's a contrived example but
suppose we graph all the people in the
world and record their age and their net
worth if you don't know what net worth
is this is kind of the total money that
you kind of own both in cash and houses
and cars and so on and just for the sake
of the argument let me assume there
aren't quite seven billion people and
the relationship between net worth and
age looks about like this in reality
that's often not the case but let's
assume that's the case here I now want
you to fit an imaginary line through the
data and pick two of the points I'm kind
of marking here as two representative
points through which the line would go
just click on two of those points that
best represent the line that best
describes the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
