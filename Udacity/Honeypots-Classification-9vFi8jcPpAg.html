interaction a low induction honeypot
typically emulates some network services
such as the web server for example you
can speak the HTTP protocol on the other
hand it is not a full version of the
service for example the emulated web
server does not have all the web
contents and server-side programs a low
interaction honeypot is typically
sufficient to detect networks can empro
and one imminent attacks on the other
hand a sophisticated attacker may
realize that these services are not full
version and probably are not real a high
interaction honeypot essentially
lubricates what a real server or
workstation has in terms of operating
systems services and applications in
other words they look really realistic
and they can be deployed alongside with
the real servers and workstations since
a high-interest honeypot mimics a real
server and workstation an attacker may
be attacking it for long time without
knowing that it is a honeypot therefore
we can learn more about the attacks on
the other hand it is also quite
challenging to make a honeypot looked
like a real server and workstation for
example we must emulate user activities
and never traffic on honeypot and this
requires a significant amount of
programming effort as well as data
storage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
