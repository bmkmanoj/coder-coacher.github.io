an EMR technology is I think potentially
a key development if emrs are adapt to
physicians they must have some
understanding of what they do to explore
that further will now turn to a second
commercial EMR praxis by infrared
corporation praxis uses machine learning
and each physician user trains it as
they see the common problems in their
practice which it identifies based on
the physicians entry of the clinical
finding most specific for each problem
over time praxis learns how that
physician usually treats each problem
and as shown here presents a note based
on the most similar past patients each
phrase is what praxis calls a clinical
concept but these are not encoded into
sno-med CT or any other data standard
they are text descriptions as defined by
each physician to avoid the erroneous
default value problem we discussed
earlier the physician must click on each
clinical concept to confirm and or edit
it this one has been clicked on and the
physician can then edit the number of
days to whatever is appropriate for that
patient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
