for a hard drive is approximately 0.01
nano dollars per bit so remember a nano
dollar is a billionth of a dollar so
this is a scent of a billionth of a
dollar or bit the latency distance
though is quite high so it's two
thousand 98 kilometers so that means
accessing data from the hard drive is
like traveling between Munich and Moscow
and this is a pretty big difference
between accessing data from the DRAM
memory which is only about three meters
away about what you can reach with your
arms which is again very different from
accessing data from the cpu which is the
distance between your thumb and your
finger so when people write programs and
they care about performance you really
have to think about memory quite a bit
you have to make sure that the data that
you access frequently is stored in these
clothes fast to reach places not in the
hard drive which is like traveling
between music and Moscow to get to your
data and no one's storing data and light
bulbs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
