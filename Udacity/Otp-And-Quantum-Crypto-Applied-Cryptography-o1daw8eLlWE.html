one-time pad is the only perfect cipher
time zombie rights wanting to know why
this is true so I probably overstated
things a little bit saying this is the
only perfect cipher that you could
certainly construct ciphers that are
perfect and are not exactly the same as
the one time pad as we've described it
but they'd be essentially the same and
what Claude Shannon proved is that to be
a perfect cipher you have to have the
key space as large as the message space
and you can never reuse a key so every
bit of the message corresponds to a bit
of the key and then with the one-time
pad we wreck soaring that we could do
some other operations that would be
equivalent of XOR and have another
cipher that would be perfect but the
important thing that was proven is that
if the key is smaller than the message
there's no way for the ciphered be
perfect there must be some information
leaking to an attacker that potentially
could be used to break it okay and then
as a follow-up to that I he also wanted
you to comment on quantum cryptography
cool okay so quantum cryptography is a
very interesting topic and there's
really two sides of that that people
think about the first is quantum key
distribution which is to take advantage
of properties of quantum physics to be
able to send a message where even if
someone intercepts it they cannot replay
it and that means that the two parties
at the end can know that if they
establish a key if that message got
through between them and they can verify
that they receive the right message that
there was no physical way it could be
eavesdropped on because the properties
of quantum physics are that if you
observe properties about a photon you
can observe some parts of it but you can
observe the whole thing and you can
observe say both the momentum in the
spin at the same time and I'm not an
expert in quantum physics I that may not
be exactly right but you can't observe
and this is Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle you can observe every property
of the photon at the same time so we can
set things up and I won't go in the
details of that now we may talk about
that in one of the maybe unit 7 I think
that would be a good topic to bring up
again and go into a little more detail
the other interest is in quantum
computing which potentially offers a way
to solve problems that we can't solve
with classical computers in efficient
way and the most interesting question
there is factoring which in unifor we'll
talk about them
factoring being hard for breaking our
essay for the security of RSA relying on
it being hard to factor numbers that are
multiples of two large primes there are
ways if you have a quantum computer to
do factoring efficiently and a
polynomial number of steps which no one
knows a way to do with a classical
computer so if it was possible to build
a large quantum computer which no one
has been able to do yet but in theory
could be done then you could break break
cryptosystems like RSA that depend on
factoring being hard because you could
factor large numbers using your quantum
computer so both of those are sort of
interesting aspects where the sort of
deep properties of quantum physics can
be used either to the advantage of
making something more secure or to the
advantage as a tiger and we'll talk
about that the impact of quantum
computing on factoring a little bit in
unit 4 ok cool I look forward to it
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
