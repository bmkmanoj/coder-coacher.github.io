one of these defects but that the class
as a whole notice most or all of these
problems I also expect that some of you
have noticed problems that are not on
the list the point is that groups do
better than individuals this is
sometimes called The Many Eyes
phenomenon there's a cost however if two
hundred people each look at 13 lines of
code for 15 minutes this amounts to more
than one week of staff time at current
loaded salary race this might cost a
company thousands of dollars is it worth
it to a company to spend that much money
to find these problems what a smaller
group size have worked just as well
would more time per person have worked
better notice also that there were all
kinds of defects I intentionally didn't
tell you in advance what the word defect
meant but here there were bugs there
were documentation issues there were in
efficiencies and there are even
violations of coding standards software
engineers have studied defect detection
and concluded the team review efforts
can be cost effective way to find
defects however the reviews must be done
in a systematic fashion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
