condition in Python and most other
programming languages or has a lower
precedence than an and if you write this
without parentheses the effect of this
is that this will be implicitly
prioritized as this meaning that the
condition that tag must be said applies
only for single quotes but not for
double quotes which would always be
stripped and this is the reason why
double quotes are stripped where a
single quote are not stripped well they
are stripped but only when we are in Tag
Mode and when we are in Tag Mode then
the characters won't appear anyway we
can apply this very same fix in our
program simply by putting parentheses
around the disjunction in here such that
the disjunction takes precedent over the
conjunction let's see whether our
example with the double quotes now works
yes it does now we actually get the
codes properly in here let's try it a
few more so let's say whether the single
quotes still work too and while we're at
it we can even add a few more to them
let's see what the output will be first
example with double quotes are still
there not stripped second example single
quotes not stripped third example just
HTML markup HTML markup is stripped next
one quotes around HTML markup quotes
remained HTM marker stripped so HTML
markup is removed in all cases how about
our Co most complex example we have a
reference with quotes within the tag are
these still properly stripped we try
this out yes everything is properly
stripped quotes and greater than signs
are handled just as they should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
