unit 5 is cryptographic protocols we're
going to look at ways to use the things
that we've seen in the previous four
units to solve problems so we'll be
using symmetric encryption will be using
cryptographic hash functions and we'll
be using asymmetric encryption to solve
problems and the main problem we're
going to solve is how to authenticate
between a client and a server anytime we
talk about cryptographic protocols we
have to think about what our threat
model is if we want to argue that a
protocol is secure we need to understand
the threat model which means knowing the
capabilities of the adversary in order
to argue the protocol is secure we need
to argue that an adversary with only
those capabilities will not be able to
break the protocol so what are the kinds
of things we need to assume so the first
main assumption is that the adversary
has limited computational power and that
generally means that we're assuming that
our encryption primitives work an
attacker who intercepts a message
encrypted with some key K is not able to
decrypt it in less than ok or have some
other advantage for decrypting that
message we also assume that hash
functions have the properties they
should that it's preimage resistant so
an adversary who has the hash of X
cannot figure out what X was and that
they also have strong collision
resistance that an adversary can't find
two values that hash to the same output
we might also make assumptions about
what the attacker can do to the network
if the attacker is passive that would
mean that they can only use drop they
can listen in on messages on the network
but they can't modify them and they
can't inject their own messages into the
network a more powerful adversary would
be an active attacker and active
attacker controls the network they can
modify data and messages they can replay
messages that means they can record
messages on the network and then some
later time replay a message that they
heard previously they can also do a tax
like we saw against diffie-hellman where
they act as a middleman intercepting
traffic between two parties and
replacing it with their own traffic so
let's have a quiz to see if you
understand threat models which of these
threat models would be a good model for
an adversary who controls
