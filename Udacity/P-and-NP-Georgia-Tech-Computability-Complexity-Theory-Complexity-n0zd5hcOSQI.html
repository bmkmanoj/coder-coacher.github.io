defined P to be the set of problems
solvable in polynomial time by
polynomial time we mean that the number
of Turing machine steps is bounded by a
polynomial will formalize this more in a
moment
bipartite matching was one example of
this class of problems NP we define as
the class of problems verifiable in
polynomial time this includes everything
in P sense of a problem can be solved in
polynomial time
a potential solution can be verified in
that time too most computer scientists
strongly believe that this containment
is strict that is to say there are some
problems that are efficiently verifiable
but not efficiently solvable but we
don't have a proof for this yet the
clique problem that we considered is one
of the problems that belongs in NP but
we think does not belong in P there's
one more class of problems that we'll
talk about in this section on complexity
and that is the set of np-complete
problems these are the hardest problems
in NP and we call them the hardest
because any problem in NP we can
efficiently transform into an
np-complete problem therefore if someone
were to come up with a polynomial
algorithm for even one np-complete
problem then P would expand out in this
diagram making P and NP into the same
class finding a polynomial solution for
clique would do this so we say that
clique is np-complete
since solving problems doesn't seem to
be as easy as checking answers to
problems we're pretty sure that
np-complete problems can't be solved in
polynomial time and therefore that P
does not equal NP to computer science
novices the difference between matching
and clique might not seem to be a big
deal and it's surprising that one is so
much harder than the other in fact the
difference between the polynomial
solvable algorithm and an NP complete
one can be very subtle being able to
tell the difference is an important
skill for anyone who will be designing
algorithms for the real world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
