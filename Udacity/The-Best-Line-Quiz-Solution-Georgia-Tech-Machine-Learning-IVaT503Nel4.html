line do you think is best
all right so so if I choose one green
and one red that means there's nine
different possible lines but they all
separate the points that is current sure
you know if I think they're intended to
even if they don't quite but I think
they do I think they actually all
separate the positives from the
negatives there in positives on the
upper right side and the negatives on
the lower left side so I mean the only
one that seems sort of special is the
middle one if I choose the middle green
in the middle red it's kind of you know
it's aesthetically pleasing there's a
lot of space on on each side okay so I'm
gonna go with that but it's not clear
you know again best if I was a
photographer that might be the best hmm
you are a photographer so let's pretend
I can draw straight lines that's pretty
good that's the line that you've chosen
yes and you think that's best well I'm
going to give you a hint Michael and
tell you that you're correct that's a
pretty a hint but now I want you to
figure out for me why that line is
better than this line interesting all
right well so one thing that's that
second line the orange line as opposed
to the orange line has against it in
some senses it seems to get really
really close to that bottom minus point
maybe it's a little too close like maybe
that minus is near other minuses that we
just can't see and since we drew really
really close a line really really close
to it it could be that we ended up
chopping off some of the minuses that
that we might want to have kept on the
other side and so maybe by drawing it in
the middle it's sort of we have the
biggest I don't know like Demilitarized
Zone no I like that so that is a very
good explanation for why you would
prefer the middle line over the other
line that isn't the middle level and you
can make a similar argument for any
other of the nine lines that that are
the other eight lines that you could
possibly draw let me draw another line
for you you tell me if you think this
one is good or bad and why it might be
better or worse than the middle and see
if you're giving a different answer I
could take one of the parallel lines
which again will pretend as a straight
line and put it there
or I get taken back the other line that
is meant to be parallel to it and why
aren't those two why aren't those lines
better or just as good
I guess I'd used the same explanation as
before which is that these the the line
that is really close to the pluses maybe
is a little too close for comfort and it
gets very close to that plus the kind of
I don't know I could point to it but
maybe you should point to it the plus
that's really close to the line I'm
going to because again if there's just
you know other data points near there
it's going to make this distinction
between the positives and the negatives
that isn't really warranted by the data
right so I can make the or the opposite
argument with you Michael which is that
listen they all separate the points they
completely explain the data as we see
them so all three of those lines explain
the data fact all nine of those lines
explain the data so why aren't they
warranted by the data what's the problem
that you might cut run into if you put
one line very close to the positives of
one line very close to the - well again
so it may be that they fit this data but
this is just a sample from the
population and so you know we don't know
what's going to happen really close to
that other plusses I mean like so like a
nearest neighbor algorithm for example
which always make me try to remember is
going to want it you know if it's closer
to the pluses it should be a plus all
right that makes sense I think that's
exactly right so your intuition and I
think the intuition that that people
should take with them is that lines that
are too close to the positives or lines
that are too close to the negatives sort
of have this feature where you're
believing the training data that you've
got too much you've decided that all of
these boundaries are fine because of the
specific set of training data that we've
got and while you want to believe the
data because that's all you've got you
don't want to believe the data too much
that's overfitting
that's overfitting so the problem with
those two lines or one way to think
about the problem with those two lines
is that these lines are more likely to
over fit and why is that it's because of
the believing the data too much so given
that we're trying to avoid overfitting
what could you say about the middle line
so here's the argument that I would make
can you tell me if you buy it Michael
this line or the line it's intended to
represent anyway
uh is the line that is consistent with
the data while committing least to it
that seems like a good way of saying
what I was feeling yeah it is funny
though cause like overfitting up to this
point we were generally talking about
overfitting as being something where
there's a great deal of model complexity
in some sense and it doesn't seem like
those lines that are closer to the
pluses or closer to the minuses are
inherently more complex they're still
lines it's interesting that they they
kind of maybe behave as if they are
right and in fact they it's a more sort
of literal interpretation of the words
over and fit right you you have decided
to fit the data and you believed it too
much and what you really want to do is
commit the least that you can commit to
the data while still being consistent
with it right so this basic idea of
finding the line of least commitment in
a linearly separable set of data is the
basis behind support vector machines so
what I want to do next is I want to see
if we can come up with some equation
that would help us define such a line
it's easy in this case because we're
staring at it but if you imagine these
points were in seven hundred and
thirteen thousand dimensions it'd be
pretty difficult to define such a plane
just by staring at it so let's see we
can kind of work out how you go about
finding this least commitment line okay
