about this okay using our old definition
of B transpose be okay you'll notice
that what it is is actually this matrix
okay sum of x squared sum of X wise sum
of X wise some of at Y Squared's well
that's just the covariance matrix of the
points assuming that they're about the
origin okay so i don't have tracked out
the mean that would be the covariance
speaking of which yet one more way of
thinking about this is that B transpose
B here is the sum of this XX transpose
that's what's referred to as the outer
product and if it's about the origin I
don't have to subtract off the mean but
the here it is written just like that
that again is the definition of the
covariance matrix this makes some sense
for those of you think about the
covariance matrix is a relationship
between the expected value of the
squares the sum of the squares of points
distributed about the mean so that's
actually if you think about it the thing
that we wanted to know we want to know
the greatest variance for those of you
that care you're thinking about it if
you think about a covariance matrix as
an ellipsoid in space your eigen vectors
are going to be end up being the major
axes of these ellipsoids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
