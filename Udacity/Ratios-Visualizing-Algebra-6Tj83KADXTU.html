try creating a table to help us out if I
started with two dimes then i'd have to
have three quarters for every two dimes
there's three quarters so five coins in
total if i add two more dimes then i
have to add three more quarters so i get
10 coins in total the ratio is a way of
representing this constant increase for
every increase of two in dimes I
increase in 3 in quarters I could also
have six times and nine quarters which
is 15 coins in total but I don't know
which case i'm in i could have had any
number of coins so it's actually
impossible to know and in fact i had 10
coins in my hand for every two dimes i
had three quarters two more dimes three
more quarters this ratio is constant I
know that last question was an obvious
so don't worry if you didn't get it
right I just wanted to get you thinking
about ratios</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
