you to do a couple things I asked you to
add to the bottom of the blog page how
long ago you we ran the query and and if
we reload this page we can see this time
incrementing and I also asked you to do
this on permalink pages so if I were to
look on a particular permalink I can see
that I can see the age of its query and
I can also tell when I create a new post
create this new post and when I submit
it I get redirected to a permalink page
whose query time increments and when I
go back to the front of the blog I see
my post on top with a nice new low query
time and finally I asked you to
implement a URL that clears the cache
and mine I called it flush which is
redirects right back to blog but it
resets the cache which causes the query
to run again
so that's what I asked you to do and now
let's take a look at the code okay so
the couple things I needed to do I
needed to use time Delta and date time
to help compute the age of my posts and
I also needed to import memcache just
the cache things now I added a bunch of
functions that are kind of handy I added
this one function called age set which
basically is a wrapper on memcache set
but instead of setting just the value
it's set it looks up the current time
using date time UTC now and it stores
that time along with the value in a
tuple and then I made another function
called age yet which what this does is
it's just like memcache yet but it
returns both the value and the age of
the item and as a Tuffle so first thing
we do is we we run the memcache yet on
just the key if it exists the value and
the time we saved it our in our and so
we break those apart and then we compute
the actual age in seconds which is we
take the current time minus the time we
saved it and then we can call total
seconds on that which is a function
that's included on time Delta otherwise
if there was nothing in the cache we
just set value Val and age to be none
and zero respectively and then we return
them so these are just handy functions
and I use them a couple places now I've
got a function that I run every time a
new post gets submitted and so
stores the post in the database and it
takes an IP parameter which is unused I
used to use this IP parameter on my
previous anti spamming version so that
you guys could still submit to the blog
and see it working but it wouldn't store
it in the database I was actually just
storing it a memcached and I got rid of
that now you just have to be logged in
as me to submit to the to the blog it
runs this get posts function which is
defined here and this basically does the
database query with update equals true
you saw me do this in the lecture this
is my technique for basically overriding
the cache with it with the new value now
there's still race conditions remember
we spent a lot of time talking about get
sand casts I didn't use those here and
then at return sandy get posts this is
the function that actually runs the
database query for me
you saw me write something like this for
ASCII Chan and here it is in the blog
this is my query and I'm using the
procedural language again to look up all
the posts this is still an extra
variable that's in there I don't
remember why code grows organically like
that sometimes here's the memcache key
I'm using I'm just calling it a string
blogs I usually store the memcache key
I'm using in a variable because
especially when I'm referencing at
multiple times so in case I want to
change it or you know just to avoid
typos that sort of thing it's good habit
to get into so first I call H get which
does the memcache lookup for that key
and gives me the posts and the h and if
update is true or posts is none so
basically if update is true or the posts
aren't in the cache run the query and
then set it to set MC key to the value
posts and then return the H I've added
another function called H stir which
basically take takes an age which in
this point is a floating point of
seconds and it returns the string
replaced or or queried you know zero
seconds ago one second ago that sort of
thing so it converts it to an integer if
the value is one we replace seconds with
second
so it's you know grammatically correct
and then we return that string and I use
the this function in my templates to
print that string at the bottom of my
pages and my blog front page I call get
posts remember this returns the posts
and the H and I pass in the age to my
template
convert age and I and I run the age stir
function on it so I can include it in my
template and then on a permalink page we
do something similar we cache each
request so this is the key for a
particular post it's just the string
post with post ID I usually prepend when
I'm looking up by ID I usually prepend a
string to the to the memcache key so
that if I want to change it later I can
just basically change this string and
everything expires we check to see if
that post is already in the cache if it
is we have the age if it's not we have
to look it up from the database and
that's how we do it and then we set it
to the cache and we set the H to 0 and
then I returned the permalink HTML which
takes my template now takes an H
parameter which is that H string so
that's all the changes there I'll show
you the templates really quick front at
HTML just has a new class at the bottom
called H and then includes that H during
that was passed in and permalink HTML
has the same thing at the bottom a class
called H with that string that we passed
in and then in our CSS file I added one
little thing to the bottom which is this
age class and this says
position:absolute this basically says
position this anywhere zero pixels on
the bottom zero pixels from the right
make it gray and make the font size 12
pixels so that's how I put it down and
lower on the lower right obviously we're
not going to grade for that but that's
just how I did it and that's the
solution to homework 6 I hope you
figured it out on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
