language abilities because of language
humans are able to think and discuss
abstract ideas this is different from
other animals who communicate with each
other but they can only do so by
signaling other members of their species
about immediate situations such as being
hungry
hurt or ready to reproduce such as using
mating dances or mating songs from birds
as we saw in lesson 3 humans have
evolved and our brains have grown larger
and as a result we've been able to
develop language our ancestors Homo
neanderthalensis had a very primitive
language which we call a proto language
so proto language is a rudimentary
language also known as pre language and
it was used by earlier species of Homo
now as we evolved our brain size
increased so did our ability to develop
and use language both psychologists and
anthropologists have suggested that the
complexity of the brain and our ability
to use language co-evolved which makes
sense with this increase in brain size
we would be able to think and
communicate more complex and abstract
ideas furthermore as the size of social
groups increased so did our need to be
able to communicate effectively with
others our ability to communicate
allowed us to form communities and hunt
together protect each other and even
develop the ability to cultivate land</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
