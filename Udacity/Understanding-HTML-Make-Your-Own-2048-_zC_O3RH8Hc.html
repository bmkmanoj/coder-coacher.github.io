starts with HTML okay
browsers are very forgiving they will
often just like try to make something
work even if you don't have the
appropriate structure but it's best to
follow
okay so then you've got your heading
that you're heading yeah so this this is
stuff that's not really necessarily
displayed on the page so you got the
title you've got some some sort of like
loading of attributes okay so wait this
linking style slash mean that's where it
gets the CSS that we were modifying
earlier yeah this stuff seems to be
about like mobile okay stuff that's not
not super relevant to figuring out how
things work at least on the web page and
then we've got the beginning of the body
which is really like what's shown on the
page okay and so I mean this is every
time I look at HT mine just see this
like wave of you know indent and unless
more indented less indented how how are
you what are you thinking about when
you're seeing this yes so basically I
want to look for two things that are at
the same indentation level and that
tells me that that's so this is the
beginning of the block and this is the
end of the block you also get this
little closing guy to say you know I
opened this div and now I close this div
now what is a div why is it called a
doof like I actually don't know why it's
called a div but divs are sort of the
basic building block of websites they're
just sort of a thing a container for
stuff there there are sort of special
kinds of things like a is usually a link
okay you got forms what about so you go
back up a bit I mean they all have this
thing this class class container class
heading so is that class just for the so
when I'm writing the CSS file and I want
to say everything that's a container is
blue is that what it's for pretty much
yeah the the JavaScript can also use
these classes okay it's it's basically
just a shorthand for saying like these
are these are similar things they should
have they should look the same
you could have specific more specific
rules for like just a single one with an
ID but mostly yeah it's for is for the
CSS you could just have all of the
styles in line but that's messy
like every time I had a what I wanted to
be a container you have to say you'd
have food yeah okay yeah I don't want to
do that okay so we have our divs what
are these H ones that's a header okay um
P what's P paragraph okay um I just sort
of makes the spacing around it it seems
like the div is the moon like the really
structural thing and this is the peas
and the A's are just sort of like things
that go inside okay it's usually yeah so
divs can just be like a blob of text
they can be a container that holds a
bunch of different blobs of text it it's
really sort of like the basic building
block of okay HTML all right um let me
play around a bit and see if I can you
know make some changes all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
