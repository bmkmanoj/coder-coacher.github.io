we mean by the happened before
relationship and I'm going to denote the
happen before relationship with this
arrow a happened before B that's what
this notation means what this notation
is implying is one of two things either
a and B are events in the same process
which means given our belief that a
process is sequential a must have
happened before B if it is a textual
order a is here and B is here then a
must have happened before B and that's
one possibility or if you're asserting
that a happened before B and a and B are
not events on the same process but a is
an event in one process B is an event in
a different process then there must be a
communication event that connects a and
B in other words if a is a communication
event of a message and B the receipt of
the same message then a happened before
B where a is a send of that message and
B is little C to the message so this is
the implication of saying that an event
in a distributed system a happened
before B and these events can be
anywhere in the system anywhere in the
system an event could be happening a
another event could be happening B and
if we are asserting that a happened
before B what we are implying is one of
these two possibilities one is that a
and B are events in the same process or
a is the act of sending a message and B
is the act of receiving a message the
same message on a different node of the
distributive system the other property
of the happen before relationship is
that it is transitive what I mean by
that is if we are asserting that there
is an event a that happened before B and
this event B happened before see the
implication is this relationship is
transitive and therefore a happened
before C so that's the transitivity
of the happen before relationship now
that I introduce to you they happen
before relationship it is time for
another fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
