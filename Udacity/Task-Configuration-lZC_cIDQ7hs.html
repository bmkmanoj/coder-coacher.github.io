belts we're in a much better position to
understand what's going on inside a
Gradle build script just like a closure
can have a delegate object the entire
build script delegates to a project
object all the keywords in the Gradle
DSL are properties of or methods on the
project object for instance the project
object has a method called task for
declaring tasks it accepts the name of a
new task and optionally a configuration
closure which we'll talk about shortly
if we run Gradle tasks to have a look at
all the tasks that are currently defined
we see under other tasks my task one
that we just defined alright
everything's working so far because the
entire build script delegates to the
project object we can actually go ahead
and leave that off when we're declaring
tasks also because groovy syntax is
awesome we can knock off those
parentheses as well since this is just
calling a function now this next part is
tricky Gradle actually reaches into
Groovy's execution model and uses an
advanced groovy feature called an
abstract syntax tree transformation
upshot of which is you can knock off the
quotes as well this is not a thing you
need to understand super deeply however
we do have more information in the demo
code provided with the class now that
we've declared a task we can also
configure some property line so we can
give might ask for a description and we
can give it a group if we then run
Gradle tasks again this is what we see
here's the group up here and here's the
description the most important property
of a task is the list of actions the
task will perform instead of setting the
actions property directly we add a
closure to the end of the list of
actions to perform using the do last
method so let's give task 4 a try Gradle
helpfully tells us so that it ran my
task 4 and that it went ahead and
printed the statement there's a few
other ways to add closures to that list
of actions for the task to perform we
can add do first to add a task on to the
front of the list we can also use the
left shift operator which does exactly
the same thing as do last this is nice
because allows us to use this very
compact syntax and this is what you'll
see most often when people are declaring
very simple tasks in Gradle we can also
declare tasks and then immediately pass
it a closure to execute as its action
this is an extremely common pattern is
the most common way that people declare
simple Gradle tasks instead of
configuring a task line by line as we
were doing previously we can also pass a
configuration closure when we're
defining a task the configuration
closure delegates to the task object so
it can go ahead and set the description
the group and the actions of the task
now you may have noticed something a
little bit weird about that
configuration block we were trying to
assign this string to description but
there's no equal sign here well Gradle
has actually done something very clever
for every property it's created a setter
with the exact same name so this line is
actually a function call omitting the
parentheses because groovy assignment
also works just as well there's only one
gotcha with this and that is if you're
assigning a collection to a property and
a configuration closure you got to use
the equal sign just a thing to keep in
mind one more thing to know about tasks
some tasks properties can be set in the
task declaration like this however not
all properties can be set this way so
check out the course code for the full
story
the only time you actually have to use
this syntax is when you're declaring a
typed task which we'll talk about soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
