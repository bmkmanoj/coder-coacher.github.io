and so with the standard deviation to
see put this again into our formula
using our original mean and now we
realize that the new salaries ex-prime
are twice the old salary oh poor
differently X will be a half of X prime
if i substitute this into the formula
over here I get the same exponential
expression but now with a half X prime
where the ex used to be now the trick is
to deal with a half that's more
complicated there now Kate's before the
very first thing is I have to bring the
half out of the parentheses over here
and there's a trick whereby I rewrite
70,000 as a half of 140,000 and you can
see where this is going with that I can
now bring the half out of the square
over here which gives me a quarter if to
square the half of X prime minus and at
40,000 square over 10,000 square now all
I have to do is have to bring the
quarter into the 10,000 so quota up here
is the same as a 4 down here now we have
to bring it inside the square so we have
to take the square root so it ends up to
be the same as bringing to the square
root of two into the square over here so
this transformation shows that doubling
the salary doubles the MU but also
doubles the Sigma it doubles the
standard deviation of those salaries
I've proven it to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
