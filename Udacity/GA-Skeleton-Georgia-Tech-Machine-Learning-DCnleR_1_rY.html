algorithm that implements a GA so what
we need to do is we start off with some
initial population and usually the
population size is fixed to some
constant we'll call it K so we just
generate a bunch of of random
individuals to get things started then
what we're gonna do is we're going to
repeat until essentially things converge
we're going to compute the fitness of
all the individuals in the population
and then we're going to select the most
fit individuals so how do you suppose we
might decide on which ones are the most
fit the ones you're most likely to go to
the problem with some people choose
people differently than just whether
they're fit I guess it depends what you
mean by fit do you mean like fit fit
like physical fitness
well I mean fit like well I did but I
guess fit like whatever the fitness
function tells you it's fit right okay
so since we since we applied the fitness
function f to all the individuals we
have scores for them and if we want to
select the ones that are most fit which
ones do you think those would be I guess
you're saying those would be the ones
with the highest scores yeah so that is
that's definitely one way to do it where
what happens is you take that say top
half of the population in terms of their
scores and we declare them to be the
most fit and everybody else to be the
least fit but there's other ways you can
do it as well one this is sometimes
called truncation selection but there's
also an idea called roulette wheel
selection where what you do is you
actually select individuals at random
but you give the higher scoring
individuals a higher probability of
actually being selected so we don't just
strictly choose the best ones we choose
weighted by who's the best
so does this get us back to exploitation
versus exploration then I think it does
I think it certainly having that thought
when I was saying it out loud that this
is it's a similar kind of idea and in
fact you can use Boltzmann distribution
type idea simulated annealing type ideas
for doing this selection where you have
a temperature parameter if you set the
temperature parameter to zero then you
get something like just choosing the top
half and if you set the temperature to
be something like infinity then you're
just gonna randomly choose individuals
for the population regardless no
irregardless is a word is it really
irrespective is what I wanted to say
irrespective of the fitness of those
individuals
well irregardless I understand what you
mean alright so then that's gonna we
declare some of them as the most fit
then what we're gonna do is pair up
those most fit individuals this is like
a dating service now and let them
produce offspring using crossover and
maybe a little bit mutation too so
instead of just taking the combination
of the two parent individuals we take
their combination and then we make
little little local changes to it to
mutate them and we let that the the
value of that pair that that new
offspring replace one of the least fit
individuals in the population so Michael
can I ask you a question sure so I'm
having a hard time figuring out what
crossover means can you draw me a little
picture sure that we this might be you
know rated-r that's one no no no you're
right because we're gonna do it well so
if there's it turns out that this is
sort of generic we can define crossover
in many different ways but I think
you're right I think it's worth looking
at some concrete examples because it
gives you some insight into why this
operation might be useful okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
