talking to the trusted computing base or
the operating system okay it's a path
that connects you typing the keys and
where these keystrokes are being
captured that path is really connecting
you and a trusted computing base and
there's no one else in between if that
is the case you have a trusted path how
do you make sure you have a trusted path
we're going to talk about a couple of
different ways this trusted path really
has to be provided by the operating
system maybe some combination of
hardware you look at an exact
combination of the operating system and
the hardware as we're going to see so
for example if you log into Windows you
have to press this key sequences and
ctrl-alt-del the idea is that when you
press this key sequence this sequence
cannot be trapped by any other program
okay this is going to take you to the
operating system so this display and the
keyboard has to be connected to the CPU
on which the operating system is running
in a way that there is no one in between
this play is not under control of
somebody else and somebody else is not
able to capture the keystrokes and
perhaps even alter them and things like
that so generally these are sort of
physically connected isn't it and
they're in close proximity right next
your CPU with a display and the keyboard
so we assume there is no one else in
between
but if you paranoid we can do sort of
couple of different things to make sure
that really we're not talking to
somebody else but the operating system
people had proposed a bunch of different
ideas to make sure that when you are
tenta cating yourself you have a trusted
path they said there's special part of
the display that only the operating
system can write so for example you
could you know indicate on the display
when you're talking with the operating
system and when you're not talking to
the operating system or actually have a
light on the keyboard okay that'll light
up when you're talking to the operating
system and it'll be off when you or not
so this way the user would know that
when it's providing I know his or her
password it is actually going
over a trusted path to the operating
system the other entity or the entity at
the other end actually is the trusted
computing base so one challenge with
these kind of things is that do users
pay attention to something you display
or a light on the keyboard or something
like that if it's a red flashing light
maybe they do or something like that but
the idea here is I think the concept of
a trusted computing path is something we
want to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
