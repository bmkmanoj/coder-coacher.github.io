this we first initialize the matching to
the empty set then we repeat the
following first build an alternating
level graph rooted at the unmatched
vertices on the left part of the
partition using breadth-first search
let's pause for a moment here and see
how this works in an example the first
iteration is trivial so let's start with
a later iteration where we have some
existing matching marked by the orange
edges here that we're trying to augment
level 0 consists of the unmatched
vertices on the left side and to go to
the next level we follow the unmatched
edges then we follow matched edges to
get back to the left hand side and then
we follow along unmatched vertices which
lead us to an unmatched vertex on the
right hand side so that's the level we
can stop at only end up with this here
for our total level graph having built
this level graph we use it to augment
the current matching with a maximal set
of vertex disjoint shortest augmenting
paths we accomplish this by starting at
one of the unmatched vertices in our and
tracing our way back let's say that I
use this path here well then because I'm
looking for a set of vertex disjoint
paths I can go ahead and delete these
vertices and with these vertices deleted
I can also go and delete all the other
vertices that got orphaned in the
process and at this point we note that I
had to delete the other unmatched vertex
in our and that tells me that I found a
maximal set of vertex disjoint shortest
length paths once we've applied all
these augmenting paths we go back and
rebuild the level graph and keeping
doing this until no more augmenting
paths exist and then we can return the
matching that we found from the
description it's clear that each
iteration of this loop what we'll call a
phase from now on takes only order e
time building the level graph is done by
breadth-first search and so that only
takes order e time and the second part
can also be thought of as a single
traversal of the graph essentially
as we're picking a path from one of the
unmatched vertices in our to one of the
unmatched in L we can follow any edge
here we don't have to be careful at all
because in fact all roads leave to an
unmatched vertex in L the key insight is
that only about the square root of V
phases are needed in order for us to get
to a point where there are no more
augmenting paths overall then we seek to
prove the theorem stating that given a
bipartite graph the Hopcroft Karp
algorithm finds a maximum matching in
time order e times the square root of V</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
