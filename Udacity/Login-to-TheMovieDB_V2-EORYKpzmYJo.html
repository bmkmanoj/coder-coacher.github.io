will use in the my favorite movies app
here's the documentation for the movie
database I've posted a link to this
documentation in the instructor notes if
you scroll down a little bit here on the
left this section on the right gives us
a list of all the methods provided by
the API I'm going to select a count and
then go to account ID favorite right
here this is a method that will be using
in my favorite movies as you might
expect this method can be used to add or
remove movies from an accounts favorite
list you can see we have this
information about the required
parameters as well as this required JSON
body section the JSON body also known as
the HTTP body is part of an HTTP request
that allows us to pass parameters
without having to pass them in the URL
like we've done before we'll start using
the JSON body when we make our first
post requests later in this lesson for
now I want you to focus on an extremely
useful feature of the movie databases
documentation if we click this post
banner here a pain will slide out from
the right and in this pain we can take a
look at example requests this is very
much like the API Explorer that we saw
with Flickr so let's scroll down a
little bit and it gives us this really
nice boilerplate code that we can use to
call each of the methods in the API so
for this particular example we're
calling HTTP here's the URL for account
ID favorite notice it has ID in red
because you'd have to substitute in an
ID value for the user ID what if we keep
going down we can see in a Cheryl
session these are some classes that
we're familiar with and this is really
nice if we continue to scroll to the
bottom we can see an example response
and for this particular method the
response returns the status code and a
status message and if it's successful
says the item / record was updated
successfully so before you get started
I'd highly recommend just taking some
time with the documentation and clicking
some of the other methods and taking a
look at their example responses and
their example boilerplate code here to
actually make the network request if we
look back at the required parameters
section we see this parameter called
session ID what's this parameter
all about well if you do some digging
you'll find that the movie database uses
sessions whenever we want to write data
using the API and by right I'm referring
to the methods that update or change
data that's stored in the movie database
so this would include methods like
account ID favorite or we're changing an
accounts favorite list it might also
include methods for rating a movie
there's some separate documentation
about sessions that's located on the
movie databases main website that I'm
looking at now i'll post a link for this
in the instructor notes as well this
page details how to create and use a
session and its associated session ID
without reading the entire page we see
that the basic workflow requires us to
create a new request token and then we
can either do step 2a or step to be step
2a says ask the user for permission via
the website or we can ask the user for
permission via the API and then in step
3 we create that session ID that we just
saw in the documentation now you'll
notice for step two we do have these two
different ways of asking the user for
permission one uses the website and one
uses the API in this lesson we're going
to use step to be and we're going to ask
the user for permission via the API and
then in the next lesson we're going to
ask the user for permission via the
website so you'll get to look at both
approaches now if you haven't already I
highly encourage you to go through this
page and read it yourself and some of
the terms might not make sense yet but
start building a mental picture of the
steps required to create a session
because the sessions what we're going to
need to make our first post request and
actually favorite movies right my
favorite movies have so we'll need to be
able to do that before we go on let's
talk to Travis and see what he has to
say about authentication and the movie
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
