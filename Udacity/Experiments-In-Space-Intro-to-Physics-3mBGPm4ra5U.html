information it's completely impossible
to say even though I explicitly said
that astronaut one was at rest and
astronaut too was moving towards
astronaut one that situation could
equally well be described as astronaut
one going towards astronaut too with
astronaut to at rest so what can we say
about the motion of astronauts wanted to
well one thing we can definitely say
that both of these space explorers will
agree on is that the astronauts are
definitely getting closer but this is
interesting that this argument can even
show up at all astronaut one thought
that he was motionless astronaut too
thought she was motionless yet clearly
there's some relative motion between
them this points to something funny
going on between motion at a constant
speed and this idea of being at rest why
don't we go back to earth to probe this
question a little more deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
