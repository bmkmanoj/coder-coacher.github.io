a bunch of them one of them is that it's
useful and that in particular it's
useful for large state spaces and the
reason that that works right is that I
don't have to actually look at all the
states do all the value iteration for
everything I basically just kind of do
it as I go along and I only visit the
states that I need to visit given where
I happen to be in the world there are
some downsides of this and one downside
is depending upon just how much
randomness there is in your transition
model you need lots of samples in order
to get a good q hat but you know what
that's true anyway if you have many many
many many many many states then you're
gonna have to do a lot of visiting to
figure out what's going on usually so
this is the sort of I think it's kind of
intrinsic to the problem now of course
if you don't have a lot of states you
still end up generating lots and lots of
samples because of the way Monte Carlo
works luckily there it's relatively
inexpensive to do in most cases it
leaves most the cases that we worry
about and in the end despite all that it
has another good feature I really like
this feature it's my favorite of its
features is that the planning time is
actually independent of the number of
states that you have oh that's why it's
useful for a large for large state
spaces I see I mean I guess if there's a
lot a lot of states do we have to expand
like a fixed percentage of them to know
what to do well sure sure you have to
that's how you're gonna that's how
you're going to generate your samples
you're going to generate lots of samples
that way so yeah but then it's not
independent at this what it is
independent of this that's one of the
cool things about Monte Carlo tree
search no I know but what we what you
had said was what I asked was so that
means that as the state space gets
bigger do we have to expand though do we
have to expand a fixed percentage of the
state space oh you said percentage I
sorry I didn't even turn that I didn't
turn that into percentage I'm sorry so
the answer is no because if you did it
would depend upon the number of states
okay but how could that be how could it
be that the state space gets bigger and
yet we don't have to look at very much
of it to to know what to do well that's
because you're really only I'm going
through you're executing through the
world and the trade-off happens in the
other bullet which is the bad thing
about MCTS it kind of reminds me of like
I don't know election surveys that's
probably not the right word
but this sort of idea that you can
actually get an idea of
how many people are voting no matter how
big the country is by just surveying a
fixed number of people right so long as
they have properties that are consistent
with that are representative and so long
as you can get a representative sample
of the states and the actions then
you're good that's that's really
interesting right now of course that's
going to depend on I mean so to me
what's going to drive that is going to
be how much randomness and entropy there
is in the transition function as you
because if it's if it's completely
deterministic you don't have to do a lot
of samples at all yeah that would make
sense but there's something else that
drives how expensive Monte Carlo tree
search is which is the fourth bullet
that I was about to write down before
you asked me this complicated question
which is that the running time is
independent of the size the state space
it's independent in the sense that it's
exponential weight in the size of the
state space it's exponential in the
effective horizon so you're saying it
doesn't matter how many states are in
the state space but it does matter how
far into the future you need to look to
make a decision yes and of course the
tree itself is growing exponentially
yeah so you're going to need to have
more and more and more of those samples
to make it work actually due to Kearns
and his colleagues we actually know
exactly what the running time is it is
Big O of the size of your action space
which makes sense because that's your
branching factor and oh I need another
variable here let's call it X which is
how many steps you're going to actually
run the thing for and that loop that I
did before raised to the horizon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
