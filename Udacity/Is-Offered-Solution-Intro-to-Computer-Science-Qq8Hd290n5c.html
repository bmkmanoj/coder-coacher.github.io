this data structure of courses let's
take a couple seconds to go through what
it looks like it's a dictionary where
each key in the dictionary is a heck
semester of courses that you'd ask the
offers and any check semester we have
another dictionary that's where the keys
are the name of the course and within
that there's another dictionary with
name value pairs this is a common way to
store data in an unstructured form where
we just have an attribute like name
teacher assistant whatever prereq down
here and then a value for that attribute
building a search engine the name of the
TA etc etc this question asks us to
write a function that determines whether
a course is offered during a given heck
semester and we're going to do that
pretty simply before we get started
let's look at the data structure what we
want to do is given a Hexham Esther and
the name of a course we want to
determine if that course is a key in the
dictionary to which that heck semester
is associated with and this is just one
line of code actually what this line of
code does is determine whether or not
the course is a key in the dictionary
that we get with the keyword heck
semester in our courses data structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
