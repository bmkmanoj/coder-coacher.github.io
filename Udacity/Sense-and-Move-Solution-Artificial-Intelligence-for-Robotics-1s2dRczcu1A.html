goes through the measurements it assumes
as as many motions as measurements it
first applies the measurement as before
and then implies the motion and when
it's done with it it prints the output
and the output is interesting the world
has a green a red a red and a green and
a green field and the robot saw red
followed by a right motion and then
green and that suggests that it probably
started with the highest likelihood in
grid cell number 3 which is the
rightmost of the two red cells it's all
read correctly it then moved to the
right by one so green correctly moved
right again and now finds itself most
likely in the rightmost cell that's just
looking at these values over here
without any probabilistic math and any
code : mentation let's look at the
output point two point one point zero
eight point one six point three eight
very correctly then were most likely
assigned this position to the rightmost
cell as should be given the sequence of
observations over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
