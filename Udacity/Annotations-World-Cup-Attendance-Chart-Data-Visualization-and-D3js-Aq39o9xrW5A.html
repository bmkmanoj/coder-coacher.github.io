created at the end of the last live
coding session hopefully one thing that
you noticed that was conspicuously
absent was any sort of context around
the chart the most extreme example of
this might be a chart without any labels
or axes or even a title but this may
seem silly most charts where at least
have axes and tick marks but even with
axes and tick marks and values at those
axes in tick marks unless we label what
the why and what the x coordinates
represent it's very hard for a reader to
interpret what's actually being
displayed you always want to make sure
that any chart you create has both
clearly displayed units in this case
millions for the attendance and years
for the x-axis as well as informative
labels that shouldn't require any
additional explanation if I label the x
axis year it should be readily
understandable to a reader and the same
applies to the y axis of attendance but
even with these editions of label tick
marks with clear units and labels on the
y and x axis a reader is still left in
the dark about what's actually being
displayed for this chart before we add
the title even the way of an idea that
it's some attendance plotted against
years between 1930 and 2014 if we don't
know what the attendance actually
represents the charts quite meaningless
as you can see even the simplest
editions can have profound effects on
how interpretable your chart is and how
effectively you convey your overall
message and while dimple jas might be
great for many common chart types and
allows us the flexibility to adapt them
by exposing the underlying t three
objects we will begin to start
customizing and adding to our chart
enough so that it makes sense to work at
the level of d3 itself part of this is
due to the fact that d3 is much more
flexible and allows for
flex interaction and animation in your
graphics and the third point while it
may not be relevant to someone who's
creating graphics in production or as I
learned III this being a course to learn
about visualization by working with d3
it really helps you to understand what
higher-level libraries are doing such as
dimple j/s how to debug their issues
when they do arise and to feel more
confident about what's going on with the
library itself and how to adapt it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
