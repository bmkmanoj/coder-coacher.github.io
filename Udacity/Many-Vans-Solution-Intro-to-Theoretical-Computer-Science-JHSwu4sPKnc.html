case that n vans splitting up the work
will take quite a bit less time from
when they leave to deliver the mail to
when they get back to base now there
might be some cases where it doesn't
actually help out too much for example
if you have a graph that is just a
straight line well then all the end vans
are going to go here and here and then
here and here and then back back back
back well you haven't really saved any
time however if you have instead a graph
like this well then you can have four
vans each go out on one of the arms and
come back to base instead of having a
single van they would have to here and
come back here and back and here and
back and here and back that's quite a
bit more time you don't want to have to
do that and that's why you use more vans
and it turns out that the time to
deliver the mail in return is always
going to be less than or equal to
depending on the actual case now how
about the sum of time taken by the vans
this is going to be at least as much as
and maybe more to see this let's
actually take a look at those same two
problems in this case if it takes an
hour to leave base and go along the road
to where you're delivering the mail and
then an hour to come back this is a very
long delivery route then if you have
four vans then the time taken is two
hours for each van which would be eight
hours which in this case is actually the
same now the other case where you have
to go along here well let's say if you
have four vans again well you need a van
to come up here and then go back you
need a van to come up here and go back
and come up here and go back in a van to
come up here and go back and that's
actually the quickest you can do it
while still utilizing all four vans in
that case you're taking two hours there
for hours there six hours there and
eight hours there instead with one man
you just take one too
three four five six seven eight total so
the actual total time taken is quite a
bit larger in this case so it really
depends on what you all want to optimize
generally the time that it takes to
deliver all the mail is probably more
important to most people than the sum of
the individual drivers time and it's
really a trade-off which one is better
