problem to another is a relation much
like the Atmos relation that you've seen
since elementary school
and well it doesn't have all the same
properties it does have the important
property of transitivity like the
traditional Atmos sign for integers or
real numbers the polynomial reducibility
sign is transitive meaning that if a is
reducible to b and b is reducible to C
then a is reducible to C for example
we've seen how independent set is
reducible to vertex cover and I claim
that vertex cover is reducible to
Hamiltonian path a problem closely
related to the Traveling Salesman
problem and from these facts it follows
that independent set is reducible to
Hamiltonian path let's take a look at
the proof of this theorem we'll let M be
the program that reduces a to B and
we'll let n be the program that reduces
B to C to turn an instance of the
problem a into an instance of the
problem C we just pass it through M and
then pass that result through n this
whole process can be thought of as
another computable function R note that
like m and n R is polynomial time thus X
is an a if and only if M of X is in B
remember M implements that reduction and
M of X is in B if and only if n of M of
X is in C because n implements that
reduction the composition of N and M is
the reduction R so overall we have that
X is in a if and only if R is in C just
as we want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
