saw that JavaScript lets us modify
global variables from within a function
does this have security implications for
our browser oh my my oh yes there are
very tragic very problematic security
implications of the ability to overwrite
or even read from a variable that you're
not expecting especially when you have a
program written in JavaScript or
something like PHP and other language
commonly used to write web applications
that's outward facing where adversaries
can keep poking you until you fall over
one of the historically most common ways
this came up in all use PHP is an
example in PHP was known as registering
or register global variables early on
PHP was commonly used to write code that
would respond to web forms now if you're
not familiar with web forms just think
about registering for an account online
or maybe buying some food or buying a
book you often have to fill in things
like this is my name this is my address
this is my credit card number here's how
much I'm paying here's how much I'm
tipping you write all of those things in
text and then some computer program on
the other side is going to do
calculations on them for example maybe
it's going to add in sales tax or
calculate how much shipping is going to
be or figure out when to send you some
email later based on the time in your
zip code of the particular shipping
company any sort of business logic in
the middle in order to do that though it
needs to know what your zip code was
when you entered it in the form field or
how much money you said you were paying
so we need to get that information in
order to make it very simple for early
PHP programmers if you wrote your
webpage and said name here this is the
name field zip code here this is the zip
code field it might automatically make
global variables in the middle of your
PHP program called name and zip code and
then you could just read out of them and
get whatever the user had posted in the
form this was super convenient but also
super deadly it is phenomenally easy to
take over a web page or otherwise
Alysha Slee attack a web page or web
application that uses this sort of
register global variables behavior one
easy way to think about this is the
values of these variables aren't set by
the programmer and they may not be
validated you can't trust people on the
web to always put in an exact integer
for their zip code you can't trust them
not to make up fake form fields that
weren't really there that contain things
like am I cleared or password
credentials or how much money should I
give this user or what's the sale or
what not in essence any bit of business
logic that you have in your program they
could fake up new values for it you
thought you were giving a 10% sale
suddenly you are giving a 110% sale in
worst case sort of scenario this
register global variables approach
turned out to be a really poor design
decision in early versions of PHP and
these days it's more or less off by
default but still it's what a lot of
people think of when they think of
global variables that we don't
necessarily have control over we're
reading or writing them but so is some
adversary now this can definitely lead
to security problems now these days even
if register global variables isn't a PHP
feature PHP programmers will still find
fun ways to make the web insecure
functions like explode which are very
similar to things like a string dot
split in Python are often used to assign
to local variables trusting the user or
trusting the person on the other side of
some sort of web interface to be well
behaved one of the big problems with
computer security is that often the
adversary is not well behaved we have to
pay attention and validate these sorts
of strings so this issue that you saw in
class relating to when can I change
global variables when are they in scope
they're not going to get the value that
I expect or make a new one now this can
have unfortunate security implications
so it's worth understanding exactly how
it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
