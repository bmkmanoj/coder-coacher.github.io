looking at a progression of random
testers from the simpler ones to the
more complicated ones and as you've seen
one of the major things creating
difficulties for us is that structure is
required in inputs we're going to do now
is look at the next level of structured
inputs that level of structure is
required for random testing of api's so
if you remember from our pictures
earlier in the course we have some
software under test and it's providing
an API or several api's for other code
to use and this is APA this kind of API
is that we're gonna focus on testing an
API is is basically just a collection of
function calls it can be invoked and
what we're gonna find when we test API
is is that our single random test is not
going to be something extremely simple
like a credit card number or a couple of
inputs to a single API call but rather a
single random test visit a constitute a
string of API calls and are a couple of
things that make this situation more
complicated than what we've seen so far
the first possibility is is that their
dependencies among API calls what this
means is there might be certain
orderings of API calls perhaps even
combined with dependencies on the
arguments to those API calls that are
either illegal or undesirable and we're
going to need to teach our random tester
to avoid those so let's just for the
moment take the example of randomly
testing a file system so what file
systems are our pieces of code the take
of the raw abstraction exported my hard
disk driver so here's the disk itself
the disk is going to talk to a driver
the driver is a piece of code running in
the operating system that understands
the details of interacting with whatever
kind of particular hard drive we're
dealing with and what it exports is the
abstraction of a block or a the block
array just means but from the point of
view of the file system what the hard
disk looks like is an array of blocks
where blocks are numbered 0 1 2 all the
way up to some very large number for a
modern hard drive and so the purpose of
the file system is to take this
low-level interface of a disk block
array and build on top of it a
hierarchical namespace that is to say a
directory structure provided by file
systems in UNIX or Windows and then
those directories of course contain
files and files are just variable sized
bags of bits that we can create until
you dynamically and so the file system
has to manage all of that structure just
to manage the free space it has to just
efficiently respond to all sorts of
calls that did perform file system
operation and so let's look at what the
file system operations are so the
question is what are the contents of the
file system API well we have things like
Mountain unmount
and these are the calls that invoke the
file system code in the first place so
if a file system is not mounted it's
just sitting there on disk it can't be
it's not being used at all once it's
mounted if contents are available to the
operating system we have calls like make
directory mcdeere creates a directory
and remove directory deletes mom open
can be used to create or just open on
the existing file
unlink deletes one I'm talking about so
the UNIX style file system interface
then there a bunch more calls so if we
want to do random testing of a file
system we're gonna be issuing sequences
of calls in the file system API and
before we get into the details let's
just think about why we might want to do
random testing of a file system well
first of all file systems are fairly
long and complicated so I've looked at
the size of five of the file systems
commonly used on Linux and are all
between 15,000 and about 70 thousand
lines of code file systems end up being
substantially large chunks of code
what's more the integrity of our data
depends on the correctness of that file
system code so for example if we save
some critical data to the disk and the
file system messes it up that is to say
it saves it in some wrong place or
corrupts it in some other way then we're
not gonna get that data back ever and so
it's really really important the file
systems work well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
