design is that the thread switches and
inter process communication can be very
expensive and by threats which we mean
if you're executing one thread in a
particular protection domain and going
to execute another thread in a different
protection domain how much time does it
take for this thread switch to be
affected by the microkernel that's the
question that we're asking here here
again we are only talking about the
explicit cost of doing the thread
switching and the explicit cost that is
involved in thread switching is saving
all the volatile state of the processor
the t1 thread that is running on the
processor its modified the registers of
the CPU all of that has to be stashed
away in the thread context block before
we can schedule the second thread to run
on the processor the cost that we're
talking about is saving all the volatile
state of the processor and one every
does is once again like construction it
shows that that threads which time in l3
microkernel is as competitive as spin
and exokernel so once again the
construction l3 debunks that myth that
microkernel based OS structure is going
to be more expensive for thread
switching compared to spin or exokernel
or even a monolithic operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
