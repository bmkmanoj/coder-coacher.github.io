lesson one this is lesson two we've been
done with lesson one for a while yeah
and we did the happy birthday up here
remember
oh yeah and in lesson two we started to
make the gist job app yeah the coffee
ordering app right so our learner has
traversed this long arduous journey and
is right here yep at the beginning of us
and three right and this is where we
need to keep working on the coffee
ordering app okay so before we talk
about that let's just move all of this
aside so we can focus on lesson three
better yeah I'm just gonna drag all of
these around okay how how many big ideas
are there in Lesson tea I think we can
do four big parts okay let's just split
these into four piles in my head veterus
okay and what are these ideas the first
one it's methods methods okay well let's
begin here then here's a look at the
different stages of the app for this
lesson we'll start by adding an order
summary section to the app and
understand how methods in Java can help
us write more efficient code later we
will add a check box for a topping like
whipped cream to add to our coffee
however we'll need to understand
object-oriented programming to determine
the state of the check box whether the
user checked it or not and include that
information in the order summary within
our app object-oriented programming
allows us to dynamically interact with
views so that we can read the state from
the views and then change the contents
of other views while the app is running
we'll add another checkbox for the
chocolate topping and then we'll add a
text field so that we can ask the user
for their name again we'll write Java
code to read in the user input from this
field and then display it in the order
summary will also learn about control
flow statements particularly something
called if-else statements so that our
app has different behavior based on
certain conditions basically by looking
at what toppings the user wants we'll be
able to adjust the price for a cup of
coffee either by a dollar or two dollars
now the order summary is not that useful
if it never leaves the app so we'll
learn about intents and Android so that
when the user hits the order button we
can send the order summary out to an
email app like this then you can specify
specific email address to send it to
will end the lesson by covering more
topics on Android resources learning
about how to support different languages
in the app such as Spanish
we'll also experiment with changing the
styles and theme of the app for example
you can change the color of the app bar
by customizing the theme of the app
there's a lot to cover so let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
