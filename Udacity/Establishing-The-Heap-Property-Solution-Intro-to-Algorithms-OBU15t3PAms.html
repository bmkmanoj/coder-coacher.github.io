certainly if we're just going to
rearrange these elements the only way
that these three elements can satisfy
the heap property is so if we put the 10
at the top and we can actually leave the
17 where it is and the heap property
will still be maintained at this node so
we swap the 10 and the 41 and now this
node may not or this subtree may no
longer have the heap property but we can
make a new picture that looks a little
something like this where we have two
smaller trees and these have to satisfy
the heap property because the whole sub
tree that we had here used to satisfy it
until we got that nice 10 out of the way
and put in a nasty 41 but notice now
we're in the same situation we were in a
moment to go but on a smaller scale we
have two subtrees that satisfy the heap
property and a root that doesn't so we
can now repeat this process pushing
these these nasty values down down
deeper and deeper into the tree until
they hit the bottom at a leaf at which
point doesn't matter how big they are
the leaves can be very very large</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
