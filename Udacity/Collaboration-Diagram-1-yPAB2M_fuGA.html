steps using a UML collaboration diagram
it called that a corroboration diagram
was like an object diagram but the lines
between the objects indicated operations
and the lines were numbered indicating
the order of the operations so in this
case we had the steps of the user
interface getting getting the request
from the user with a brew button and
then asking the hot water source for
whether it's ready and then asking the
containment vessel whether it's ready
and then starting the hot water source
heating up water so there's three steps
labeled one two and three here and we
can see that there's there ought to be
at least three classes supported to deal
with those three possibilities
is it possible here for this diagram to
be more descriptive in the sense that it
seems like when you ask the hot water
source is it ready or not if it says it
is ready then you might make the next
check to see if the containment vessel
is ready but if it says no it seems like
a whole other steps set of steps may
have to be taken to indicate to the user
hey the water hot water source not ready
to go okay so remember that a use case
or a representation of a use case in a
collaboration diagram or a sequence
diagram is not contingent okay it's it's
one step by step walk through the system
and what we're going to have to do is to
deal with contingencies which are
obviously an important part of this
whole process we're going to have to
have multiple diagrams and one of the
things that Martin does is suggest that
we can add together those diagrams so I
think that maybe it's where you're going
we want to have them them all there but
we'll do them a step at a time so to
speak so we would have I guess a use
case then for user presses brew button
and the water vessel is not ready like
that would be a separate use case that
we can model that we're going to tie
that in later with this situation which
seems like we're pressing brew and
everything's ready to go that's where
we're going okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
