that goes hand-in-hand with the levels
of protection that we just talked about
in designing a secure system the first
principle to adhere to is economy of
mechanisms and by that what is meant is
that the mechanism should be easy enough
so that it can be verified the mechanism
should be easy enough so that it can be
verified whether it works or not that's
important economy of mechanisms the
second principle is what he calls
failsafe defaults the idea is you want
to explicitly allow access to the system
or information the default should not be
no access but the reason for saying this
is because if the default is no access
then there is no way to guarantee that
that information is protected this is a
negative statement again so instead of a
negative statement like that you want to
explicitly allow access to information
that's what is a second design principle
is in designing the system you make sure
that the default is failsafe
the third design principle is what he
calls complete mediation and by that
what is meant is that the security
mechanism should not take any shortcuts
for example in authentication you want
to make sure that when somebody presents
credentials for authenticating
themselves with the system that has to
be checked completely and what that
means is that there should be no
shortcuts to authentication an example
of a shortcut will be a password file
that lives on storage if it is cached
for performance reasons that can be a
source of security violation because the
actual password file on the storage
system may have changed but the cached
copy in memory may not be reflecting it
and that would result in
violation of security if the
authentication uses the cached copy
instead of the persistent copy so that's
an example of why you need complete
mediation in designing a secure system
so that's another principle that a
secure system should adhere to the next
design principle is what is called open
design meaning that you want to make the
design completely open so in other words
you publish the design exactly spec it
out and publish it but protect the keys
that are used by the design what that
means is that cracking the design even
though it is published in order to
access the design or get any useful
service out of the system you have to
present keys and those authentication
keys should be so hard to break
computationally breaking the key should
become infeasible so that's what is
meant by open design and what does open
design principle also Fosters is the
underlying tenet that detection is
easier than prevention we don't know
what all attacks are possible from the
bad guys and so it is not possible to
prevent all of them and therefore what
we want to do is you want to publish the
design but make breaking the protection
computationally infeasible and detect
that a violation has happened then
trying to prevent it detect that a
violation has happened so that's the key
idea behind this open design principle
the next principle talks about
separation of privilege you may have
seen quite often in banks two keys may
be necessary to open the vault of the
bank and the two keys will be held by
two different individuals so that both
of them have come together in order to
open the vault so this is the idea
behind separation of privilege the next
principle
talks about least privilege that is we
want to use the absolute minimum
capability that we need in order to
carry out a certain task so the controls
in the system should be based on need to
know an example would be to do certain
things on your computer for instance if
you want to install certain new pieces
of software you may be able to do that
as a normal user on your laptop but for
certain things you may need
administrative privileges so clearly
identifying what functions you need
administrative privilege or super user
privilege versus what functions you need
normal privilege and ensuring that the
right level of privilege is provided or
afforded by the system to the user is an
important design principle and in fact
this is the origin for the idea of
firewalls that are common these days in
organizational setups
what firewalls do is to ensure that
individuals within an organization are
able to access external information from
inside the corporate network only on a
need basis or information that is inside
the corporate network is allowed to get
out only under authorized conditions so
that's the the need-to-know based
controls and that has become very common
these days with the prevalence of
firewalls and in any administrative
setup another principle is least common
mechanism or in other words if there is
a mechanism that the system wants to
implement to assure information security
at what level should that mechanism be
implemented should it be implemented in
the kernel or should it be available as
a library that is outside the kernel
because there are implications when
something is inside the kernel it has
access to information that is also
inside the kernel whereas if it is a
library sitting on top of
then you can limit the amount of damage
a malfunctioning mechanism can do to the
system as a whole so that's the idea
behind these common mechanism and the
last design principle that Salt's had
identifies is psychological
acceptability and by that what is meant
is the mechanisms being easy to use for
the end-user so that they completely
understand what they are doing when they
are using a particular mechanism that is
provided by the system so good user
interface is something that is extremely
important as one of the design
principles in building a secure system
two things jump out when you look at
this set of design principles that is
laid out by Salter in his seminal paper
back in the early 70s the first thing
that jumps out is all of these are
positive statements they are not
negative statements I mentioned earlier
saying that my system prevents all
violations is a negative statement
because it is saying that my system is
bulletproof no system is bulletproof and
therefore all the things that are being
laid out as design principles are
positive statements and they give a way
by which you can say that these are the
things that it can do and you build
enough into your design such that you
can detect violations when they occur
rather than trying to prevent them
prevention is much harder than detection
the other thing that jumps out is the
fact that all of these principles laid
out in the early 70s are applicable to
today's systems and these principles
were crafted when computers were not
even connected to the extent that they
are today so the two key takeaways from
these design principles are first of all
you want to build the system in such a
way
cracking the protection boundary is
computationally infeasible that's the
first take away the second takeaway is
you build the system to detect
violations rather than prevent violation
because prevention is much harder
detection on the other hand is something
that is doable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
