position always increases with time
there is no way that the derivative can
be negative that the rate of change can
be negative otherwise the position would
have to go down if that was the case so
we can rule out the red version now
let's look at this step almost a step we
needs to ramp up the velocity and ramp
down but the velocity here we accelerate
and here we decelerate okay and this is
an almost precise replica of that font
so the same shape it has to be the green
one it cannot be it cannot be the purple
one now for this curve we accelerate
positively the velocity grows you see
that we start with small velocity the
velocity gets larger as we go up to that
point here so acceleration has to be
positive the rate of change of velocity
has to be positive which rules out the
green curve we are left with the siding
model the red curve is the right one or
the perfect office the right one look at
this part of the curve the position is
decreasing if the position is decreasing
velocity has to be negative see we start
with a velocity of almost zero and then
the velocity becomes very negative this
is very steep the rate of change is very
high in a negative direction which means
that we need acceleration to the
negative strong negative acceleration it
has to be this red part it can't be that
green part and here acceleration is
positive again high and positive to turn
that negative velocity into a velocity
of zero we got a positive peak in the
acceleration and eventually the
acceleration is zero the velocity is
zero and the rate of change of the
position is zero so it's the red</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
