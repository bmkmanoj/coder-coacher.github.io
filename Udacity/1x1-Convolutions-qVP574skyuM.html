another idea it's the idea of one by one
convolutions you might wonder why would
one ever want to use one why owen
convolutions they're not really looking
at a patch of the image just at one
pixel look at the classic convolution
setting it's basically a small
classifier for a patch of the image but
it's only a linear classifier but if you
add a one by one convolution in the
middle suddenly you have a mini neural
network running over the patch instead
of a linear classifier interspersing
you're convolutions with one by one
convolutions is a very inexpensive way
to make your models deeper and have more
parameters without completely changing
their structure they're also very cheap
because if you go through the math
they're not really convolutions at all
they're really just matrix multiplies
and they have relatively few parameters
I mention all of this average pooling
and one by one convolutions because I
want to talk about a general strategy
that has been very successful at
creating covenants that are both smaller
and better than covenants that simply
use a pyramid of convolutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
