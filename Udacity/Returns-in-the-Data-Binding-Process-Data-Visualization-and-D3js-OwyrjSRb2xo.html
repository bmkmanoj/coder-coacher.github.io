clearing the console output since with
such a narrow window the table becomes
unreadable let's start inspecting what
gets returned from each of the function
calls in the d3 data binding chain as
you can see here d3 select passing an
SVG selects the SVG element on the page
which in our case is at the bottom of
the window below the image of the data
binding process which i'll be talking
through and currently there's no
elements contained in it correspondingly
in the image we have an SVG element on
the page that's not bound to any data
and we have our data variable which
contains all the data in World Cup tsv
running the next function here the
select all circle which is a sub select
looking for circle SVG elements
contained within the SVG we can see here
that actually returns an empty selection
and this should make perfect sense since
we haven't added any circles to our page
and our SVG is empty what happens next
with the call to the dot data function
passing in our data JavaScript variable
representing all the rows in our world
cup tsv is where d3 binds the rows of
our data file to the elements on the
page but what I've just said probably
doesn't make a whole lot of sense how
can we bind data to an empty selection
since there aren't any circles on the
page and even stranger is what gets
returned here we see way of an array of
836 elements which got returned from the
data bind what are those elements where
did they come from and where does the
data reside that we've bound to it well
this is where things get strange and
magical I've updated diagram to reflect
this process since there are not yet any
elements on the page corresponding to
either our rows of the data or circles
on the page which are bound to data III
essentially creates empty placeholder
nodes which you can think of something
like a virtual HTML no
would it exists in our JavaScript scope
or in the console but is not yet visible
on the page as an SVG element and each
one of these virtual placeholders gets
associated with one row in the data file
so this mysterious array that got
returned is actually an array of
placeholder elements that have been
associated with some data and my graphic
I've only shown for for clarity but this
essentially has all eight hundred and
thirty six rows of our data bound to 836
placeholder elements and to prove that
there aren't yet any circle elements on
the page I rerun the Select statement
again d three dot select SVG dot select
all circles and again an empty selection
returns so while we have told d3 we're
going to be inserting 836 of some
element associated with some data d3 has
not yet added anything to the page well
you might be asking yourself now that we
have some data bound to some virtual or
placeholder elements how do we actually
draw them on the page well this is where
the mysterious that enter selection
comes into play that enter corresponds
to a d3 selection of all the virtual
nodes or placeholders bound to some data
which aren't yet on the page in our case
since there isn't anything already on
the page this enter selection simply
corresponds to every placeholder bound
to every row of our data and if we
inspect what's contained in the enter
selection we get return something even
more interesting than what gets returned
from dot data here we see we have an
array of 836 elements but instead of
corresponding to these mysterious
placeholders the enter selection
corresponds to actual JavaScript objects
which contain a data field which
represents a single row of our data file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
