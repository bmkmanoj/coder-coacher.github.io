in length great job if you found this
number remember these are the legs of
the triangle since they form the 90
degree angle the side across from the 90
degree angle this side is called the
hypotenuse we don't know the length of
the hypotenuse so we'll call it X we'll
start with our Pythagorean theorem and
we'll plug in the numbers for the legs
here and then the hypotenuse here so
we'll have 32 squared plus 24 squared
equals x squared will square each of
these numbers and then we'll have these
two added together equals x squared this
gives us 1,600 equals x squared now we
want to take the square root of both
sides of the equation to solve for x
when we take the square root will need
to include the plus or minus symbol but
in this case since the distance is
positive we can disregard the negative
root we only want the positive root this
gives us x equals forty or forty units
in length now there was another way to
solve this problem and it involves a 345
right triangle this is one of our
special triangles for our special right
triangle the side links are the ratio of
three to four to five it turns out the
side length of this triangle are in the
same exact ratio we know that the legs
are 24 and 32 so I'm going to put those
here if we multiply this leg by eight we
would end up with 24 and if we multiply
this leg by eight we would wind up with
32 so we can see that eight would be the
multiplier for this ratio so to get the
side length or the hypotenuse of this
triangle we would just need to multiply
5 by 8 this is another way without using
the Pythagorean theorem that we can find
this hypotenuse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
