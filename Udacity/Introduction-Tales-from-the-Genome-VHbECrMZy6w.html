genomes are made of a chemical substance
called DNA which holds all the
information we need to make up who we
are and in this lesson we're going to
talk about how our cells transform
genetic information into our flesh and
blood quite literally in fact we're
going to focus on a process that's
referred to in biology as the central
dogma central because it's true for
virtually all life the processes of
transcription and translation which will
turn our DNA genetic code into the
protein of who we are and to do this
we're gonna focus on the trade of blood
type so you're talking like a B+ exactly
you probably heard of these blood types
before they're referred to as the ABO
blood types and they're pretty important
to know especially if you're in the
doctor's office
that's true in fact over 15 million
people per year had donated blood in the
US alone and over 5 million people per
year received blood transfusions so
knowing your blood type can help save
your life or the life of someone else
it's actually a lot of people in it some
of you might even know your blood type
and so we want you to tell us if you
know it are you type a B a B or oh and
if you know about your positive negative
factor don't worry about that right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
