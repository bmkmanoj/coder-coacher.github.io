computer instead of a real computer is
that we want to have a machine which is
as easy as possible but still lets us
capture the main aspects of a real
computer and the reason why you want to
have a simpler computer is that a real
computer contains lots of parts that are
not really interesting when we want to
analyze an algorithm and also you might
have different computers that run at
different speeds but actually that
doesn't really say something about your
algorithm in the next year when the
faster computer model comes along you
can already run your algorithm a bit
faster but that doesn't really say that
your algorithm has become better so our
goal here is to strip down a computer
that you're used to to a model that is
as simple as possible but still has
basically the same capabilities as a
real computer and so we'll do this as a
quiz and what I want you to think about
is what are the essential components for
having a minimal computer model and what
I mean by essential is that the computer
must still be able to prefer to solve
problems to perform any computation that
this machine here could but also not
anymore so what I would like you to do
is to check off each of those boxes if
you think that this component of a
computer is essential to keep in a
computer model so do you need a memory
to store your results in do you need a
graphics card some sort of input and
output do you need a mouse do you need a
monitor some sort of file system an
operating system programming
capabilities or a cd-rom and keep in
mind that we're looking for a model that
is as simple as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
