home robot space and many of them share
some traits in common with curry but
there are many things that we do
differently for one curry is a moving
robot
so unlike the robots that sit on the
table he can actually drive around your
house and be where you want him to be to
take pictures wherever in your house
curry doesn't talk so a lot of those
home robots they they speak English or
whatever language you in the country
you're in Korea explicitly doesn't talk
so that we set expectations more like
those of a pet rather than those of a
butler and so you don't think he's
uncanny you're creepy because he can't
actually keep up dialogue with you
properly he just makes cute noises and
that's forgivable so one of the main
differences is that curry has a
personality and we focus a lot on
personality personality matters a lot
and getting the personality right
matters a lot so first was curious
personalities is earnest and humble and
he never gets angry with you I had a
robot that size you really don't want an
angry robot to get angry with you that
looks very scary a tiny tiny robot like
donkeys Cosmo it's okay if he gets angry
and snarky or whatever because it's kind
of cute that see a little robot besides
throwing a tantrum but a robot our size
is already is too big to throw a tantrum
if you throw a tantrum is it scary one
of curries other big features is that he
will have over-the-air updates regularly
and so what you get when you first get
curry out of box is not what curry is
going to be will do forever curry will
gain in capability and intelligence as
over time so your robot grows with you
in some sense he's going to keep getting
better when we launched our robot at CES
we went a whole lot of awards and the
press coverage was incredible way more
than I ever imagined we could get and
for us that was validation that our
design really speaks to people and
something that they would really want so
we got best of CES from and gadget and
from PC Magazine and and from Wired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
