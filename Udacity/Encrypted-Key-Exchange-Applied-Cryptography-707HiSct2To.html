Steve Delavan and Michael Merritt back
in 1992 there have been many many
variations on this protocol many of
which are still in use today
and this protocol starts from
diffie-hellman which you should remember
from unit 3 where each party starts
they've agreed on the generator and some
modulus the client picks a random XA
value raises G to that power sends the
result to the server the server picks a
random xB value
raises you to that power and sends the
result to the client they can both now
compute the same key by raising the
value they received to the power of
their random value the problem with
diffie-hellman for authentication is if
there's an active attacker that attacker
can change the values send something
different set up a shared key
independently with each party and act as
a middle attacker intercepting all the
traffic because the attacker knows the
keys on these two separate channels the
idea of encrypted key exchange is to
combine this with symmetric encryption
to allow the client and server to
authenticate each other even if there's
a middle attacker here's how it works so
I assume there's some password that at
the beginning of the protocol is known
to both the client and the server then
the way this protocol works the message
that the client will send to the server
instead of just being the message that
would be sent in diffie-hellman is now
that message encrypted using the
password so this is symmetric encryption
using P the message that would have been
the message in the diffie-hellman
protocol and in addition to that we also
need to send the name of the client so
let's say that's Alice when the server
receives the second decrypted and knows
this password and so it obtains the
value that would have been sent in the
diffie-hellman protocol that means it
can compute a key using its secret value
xB combining that with a decrypted
result here as in the diffie-hellman
protocol it also sends a message back to
the client in diffie-hellman that would
just be G to the X be mod Q where xB is
the secret value selected by the server
now we're going to combine that with
symmetric encryption encrypting that
with the password Alice decrypts that
message so she can also obtain the value
here and obtain the key using
normal diffie-hellman technique so now
we'll have a quiz to see if you
understand the uke protocol the question
is which of these are drawbacks of using
the protocol as we've described it here
to authenticate a user that would be
Alice on this side to a website that
would be the server on this site so the
first possibility is that it's
vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks
this is where an attacker goes through a
dictionary of common passwords trying to
guess the password of a user the second
choice is that it requires servers to
store the passwords in clear-text and as
we discussed in unit 2 this is never a
good idea the third choice is it's
vulnerable to meet in the middle attacks
just like the diffie-hellman protocol
