similarity between the target problem in
the source case if we recall the
original exercise a divided answered in
that exercise woman climbing up a ladder
is conceptually similar is semantically
similar to a woman climbing up a
stepladder the same kind of concepts
occur in both situations woman and step
ladder or ladder pragmatic similarity
concerns with external factors factors
external to the representation such as
goals as an example in the dunker
radiation problem the physician had a
goal of killing the tumor which was
similar to the goal of capturing the
fort in case of the rebel army and the
King pragmatic similarity refers to a
similarity of external factors factors
external to the representation such as
similarity of goals in the dunker
addition problem for example the
physician had the goal of killing the
tumor which was similar to the goal of
capturing the fort in case of the rebel
army and the King example the third
measure of similarity structural
similarity structure here refers to the
structure of representations not the
physical structure the structural
similarity reference to similarity
between the representational structures
to the target problem and the source
case and we'll look at an example of
this in just a few minutes know that one
can assign different kind of way to
these three measures of similarity so
some theories of penology focus on
structural similarity other theories of
penology focus on semantics and
pragmatics of morality there is also why
you may have given slightly different
answers to the questions in the first
exercise then divided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
