know is how much time the ball spins in
the air and that's governed entirely by
its vertical motion remember this
equation let's use that so maybe I
should write Delta Y instead of Delta X
tempest eyes this is vertical motion why
not that Delta Y the total distance the
ball moves is just H and the ball starts
at rest so I can ignore this term that
just leaves me with this one-half GT
squared remember instead of a i wrote G
the acceleration due to gravity that
tells me the time the ball spends in the
air is twice the height / g and the
square root of that and when you plug in
1.2 4 h and 10 for g you get a value of
zero point four nine seconds ok so
that's how long the ball spins in the
air now let's analyze the horizontal
component of motion and that's covered
entirely by the electric force and
remember the electric force is equal to
Q times e which in this case would be
point 1 x 100 or 10 Newtons well that 10
you enforce is causing an acceleration
and we know that F equals MA so 10
Newton's is equal to mass times the
acceleration in the X direction I should
say because we're just looking at that
component motion for now solving this I
find that this X acceleration is equal
to 10 divided by the mass and when i
plug in 8 kilograms I find that's equal
to 1.2 5 meters per second squared well
now I can use my good friend Delta X is
equal to initial velocity times time but
there's no initial velocity so I'll
ignore that plus one-half a that's this
a times the x squared and the time we're
going to use is that point 49 seconds we
found before and that gives me a
distance of 0.15 meters so actually if
this was 1.2 meters it only moved about
to hear good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
