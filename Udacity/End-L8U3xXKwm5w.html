that ends the lesson on Lucas kannadi
flow that's pretty much true it's only a
little bit of a lie because we're gonna
see a little bit more of this derivative
motion stuff in the in the next lesson
but basically what we do is we solve for
a different flow at every point by
assuming that a window over that point
had a particular flow everywhere then we
move the window a little bit and now we
pretend that in this new window the flow
might be something different even though
those windows overlap which is a little
strange but but that's how you do it so
it's okay to have small errors along the
way like that but the idea so that
there's a little bit of a contradiction
here right in fact that contradiction is
and what I just said we assume that a
window is all moving the same way around
a point and we assign that value to that
point then we move the window a little
bit and we throw away that last thing
and we say we're going to sign it to the
next point even though those windows
overlap you might say I want to carve
the image up into sort of coherently
moving patches and so there's two parts
of that there's this notion of how do i
do the carving up and what do you mean
by coherently moving and what that means
is you've got a model for the motion
inside these regions and the next lesson
we'll talk about motion models and how
we could find regions that behave
according to some motion model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
