says the field lines drawn correctly
let's just look through each one and see
if we can find any flaws with them so
these field lines look pretty good they
all point from positive to negative
charges but something odd is happening
right here you'll notice here that two
field lines are actually intersecting so
what would that mean if we had a
particle right here in this electric
field well according to this field line
the particle should be pushed this way
assuming it's positive and according to
this field line it should be pushed this
way and we know that at a given location
an electric field can only push on a
particle in one direction so this case
what's pushing on it in two different
directions is just nonsense so we know
that this diagram has to be wrong and in
fact anytime we have a field line
diagram like this where two of the lines
intersect we've done something wrong so
we'll keep that in mind when we're
looking at the other diagrams now this
one looks a little better but doesn't
look like there are any lines that
intersect each other so we don't have
any contradictions of the field pushing
in two different directions at once
there are still some odd things
happening in this diagram though in
particular I'm Ajan a particle right
here so if we imagine this particle has
a positive charge the field lines say
that this particle should be pushed in
this direction by the electric field
well that doesn't seem right this
positive charge will be right next to
this giant negative charge which should
really pull it in and since this
positive charge over here is relatively
small we'd expect this force to be more
like that pointing towards the negative
charge so because this negative charge
is so big we'd expect these lines
showing how positive charges will move
to bend more towards the negative charge
like this so this means this one can't
be the right answer either which of
course leaves only this answer and let's
just do a check through to make sure
everything makes sense here I don't see
any lines intersecting each other so we
don't have the problem from this one and
it looks like all the field lines up
here bend in towards the giant negative
charge like we expect them to so
everything looks in order in this
electric field line diagram if you were
able to identify this one as the correct
diagram great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
