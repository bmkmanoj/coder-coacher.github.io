to take care of in our data model
deletion rules what our deletion rules
well let me ask you this what happens to
all the notes in a notebook
when this notebook is deleted and what
happens to the notebook when a note
inside it is deleted these questions can
be resolved setting deletion rules let's
start with the notes property the
deletion rules are over here and we have
several options no action which is
usually not something that you want to
use nullify cascade and deny deny it is
also something that you usually don't
use so our common options are nullified
and cascade when we delete a notebook
what should we do to the notes they
should be deleted also that's what
cascade means when notebook is deleted
all the linked notes will go away so
this should be cascade and we need to do
the same thing for the inverse
relationship what happens to the
notebook when one note is deleted should
we delete the notebook obviously not
what we should do is remove the
reference that that notebook had to this
note that is what nullify does one last
warning before we move on getting your
deletion rules wrong is one of the most
common beginner mistakes if you said
cascade on both relationships your app
will crash we'll talk about that later
so pause this video now and setup your
deletion rules now as well and that's it
we're done setting up the model and from
now on it's gonna be pretty smooth
sailing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
