human genome instead of just counting
the number of letters it has is to think
about it in physical size remember
that's 3 billion base pairs that takes
up space but how much space well let's
imagine that a base pairs about the size
of a light bulb a light bulbs about 13
centimeters from tip to tip and let's
imagine that like our base pairs we
could stack our lightbulbs into n 13
centimeters long each if we had three
billion we could get past the moon over
390,000 kilometers that's a lot but
let's get serious Matt this is a lot
bigger than a base pair isn't a base
pair only about point 34 nanometers this
is true point 34 nanometers is actually
very small much smaller than a light
bulb but at three billion base pairs
three billion times point 34 nanometers
is a billion animators and a billion
animators is exactly one meter long look
at that wow that's really long in the
actual length that's more than half of
me I know an actual link this is what
actually has to fit inside yourself but
not just this you have one copy for mom
and you have another copy from dad you
have two copies of the human genome and
every cell in your body this together is
over two meters of DNA that's taller
than I am Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
