what's different between just doing
detection and actually doing tracking
and that's shown as an example here here
we have 20 frames taken and here's some
dude right there you can see that he's
walking across all these and we just
like to keep track of him and of course
he's changing his appearance every frame
he's not gonna look identical from one
frame to the next
so detection we independently detect the
person each time right so we maybe have
a little model of what this person looks
like and we run it maybe all over the
image and we say AHA you know he's here
uh-huh he's here uh-huh he's there and
just he's there no more aha because it's
like not exciting anymore okay so that's
detection tracking we do a little
different what we do is we predict the
new location of the object based upon
the estimated dynamics and I say
estimated than amicus for example this
guy he's walking so maybe we asked maybe
he's got a constant velocity but we
don't know what that velocity is aa
priori right we have to estimate it
right so here we have an example where
we detect him here and it says you know
we'll estimate the velocity but maybe we
estimate a zero velocity or we have some
prior reason to believe he's moving to
the left because this is a sidewalk
where people move to the left
often fine that allows us to make a
prediction in the next image of where
that person will be
and then we detect them so now we can do
two things first of all we can improve
our estimate of where he is based upon
both our detection and our prediction
and second now we do have a reasonable
estimate of the velocity so we can use
that velocity to predict in the third
frame detect etc etc we iterate so this
is what the the basic tracking loop is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
