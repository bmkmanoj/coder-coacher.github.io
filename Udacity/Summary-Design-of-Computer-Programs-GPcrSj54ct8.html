we learned that probability is a
powerful tool for tackling problems with
uncertainty we learned that we can do
search with uncertainty like we did
search in the previous unit over exact
certain domains here we can handle
uncertainty in our search we learned
that the notion of utility gives us a
powerful and beautiful general approach
to solving the search problems it gives
us the best action function with which
we can solve any problem that can be
specified in the form that best action
expects and that's a wide variety of
problems now some of them are so complex
that they can't be computed in the
feasible amount of time and there are
more advanced techniques for dealing
with the Proxima to that but it's
incredibly powerful because it separates
out the how versus the what you only
have to tell the computer what the
situation is you don't have to tell it
how to find the best answer and it
automatically finds the best answer we
learned you can deal with probability
through simulation making repeated
random choices and just counting up how
many one answer occurs versus another
and we learned that if the total number
of possibilities is small you can just
enumerate them you can count them all
and you can get an exact answer as a an
exact fraction rather than an
approximation and we learned some
general strategies that don't have to do
with probability when we were trying to
figure out how to add printing to our
game we looked at the notion of a
wrapper function that is how we inject
functionality into an existing function
by sneaking it in on top of one of the
arguments and this is an example of
aspect-oriented programming where we
take the aspect of printing out what's
happening and keep that separate from
the main logic of the program we learned
that you can do exploratory data
analysis when I was looking at the two
strategies for playing Pig and where
they differed that was a completely
different question than what I designed
the pig program for but because I put
together the right pieces it was easy to
do the exploration and come to an
understanding and we learned or at least
I learned because I was the one who made
the mistake that errors can pop up
particularly in the
types of arguments and results that
functions expect in return and that you
have to be careful in Python to deal
with that because Python doesn't give
you the seat belts that other languages
have to protect yourself from those
types of errors so you have to be
vigilant on your own and finally that
was a lot to cram into one unit so if
you follow it all along all of that
congratulations for the work you've done
you've learned a lot have fun with the
homework we'll see you in the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
