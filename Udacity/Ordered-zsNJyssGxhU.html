actually express this post condition
let's break it into two parts and the
first part is going to be the part where
the output is going to be ordered and
the question is what does it mean for a
vector of integers why to be ordered so
let me give you another chance on that
part of it to state in English what it
means for a vector of integers wide to
be ordered precise English for every
element and why if there exists an
element that is after it then that
element must be greater than or equal to
the current element we're looking in
almost there okay you what Jared did is
he broke the specification into two
parts one part is all the elements
except the last one and he stated
exactly what the post condition is for
that but he didn't say anything about
the last one okay so if we wanted to
have a precise specification we'd have
to deal with with that one as well
okay now it turns out in this particular
case that we could do a little proof in
our head to say that if the post
condition that he specified for all the
other elements is true that implies that
the last one must be the greatest one so
we could get we could get away with that
and in fact that's a pretty nice clean
way of expressing it notice also that
Jared used the word for each and when
you hear that phrase it's suggestive of
in our first order logic of one of those
quantifiers that I mentioned the
universal quantifier for each or for all
and so we're going to we're going to see
when we specify this in first order
logic that that that quantifier is going
to be there in first order logic when we
introduce a quantifier at the same time
that when we use a quantifier at the
same time we introduce a variable which
is going to stand for the typical
element of the vector okay so for each I
where I is going to be an index position
into y then we can say something about
the value that's held in position wah I
and the position I plus one okay so the
quantifier for each has a variable that
comes with it we could call it I or J or
whatever you'd like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
