about software processes is that there's
not just one single process but there
are multiple possible processes
depending on your context depending on
the kind of applications that you're
developing in this course we're going to
try to cover the spectrum of the
possible processes as much as possible
by focusing on four main software
processes the first one is what we call
normally the waterfall process and we
call it waterfall because in the process
we go from one phase to the other in the
same way in which water follows the flow
in a waterfall the second process that
we consider is what we call evolutionary
prototyping and in this case instead of
following this set of rigid steps what
we try to do is to start with an initial
prototype and evolve it based on a
feedback from the customer we will then
move to a slightly more formal process
which is the rational unified process or
the unified software process and this is
a kind of project heavily based on the
use of UML so we'll also cover UML when
discussing this kind of project finally
the fourth kind of process that we'll
consider is the family of agile software
processes and these are processes in
which we sacrifice the discipline a
little bit in order to be more flexible
and being more able to account for
changes and in particular for changes in
requirements and we're going to cover
each one of these four processes
extensively in the rest of the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
