for NP completeness we have sat we have
vertex cover we have independent set we
have clique and we have shortest tour
and I guess also traveling salesmen in
some way it's amazing isn't it that all
of those problems here are np-complete
which means in a way they're equally
hard to solve although they're all quite
different now I promise you a library of
NP completeness so what I am going to
give you now is for additional
np-complete problems that are often very
very useful for showing NP completeness
or also for recognizing and P
completeness because even before you do
a formal proof it's usually a good idea
to say oh this problem this looks very
close to Sat we better be careful this
could be np-complete so you don't always
have to do the formal proof it can also
be a good indication of how hard a
problem could be the four additional
problems I would like to show you are a
problem called 3sat a problem called K
coloring a problem called packing and a
problem called common substring so 3sat
is basically sad but there's one
restriction and that is that each clause
has exactly three variables and that of
course is a nice assumption to make
in many proofs of NP completeness
because if you have exactly three
variables in each clause these proofs
often become easier to read and much
cleaner as a side info 2sat so where
each clause has just two variables is
solvable in polynomial time
so one number here can make a difference
and the resulting 3sat formulas look
like this so so you have a three
variables here in this clause then three
variables here and of course with
another index and so on K coloring asks
you if you can color a graph with K
colors so K is given as part of the
input and what is meant by coloring is
that you give each vertex a color such
as here so we color this one red this
one red this one green and this one also
green the constraint is you cannot
cutler two vertices with the same color
if they are connected by an edge so this
year would not be allowed and actually
the graph I've drawn here cannot be
colored with just two colors so you need
three colors to color this graph this
year for example would be one solution
it cannot be done with two
and of course that is stated as a
question so is it possible to color the
graph using K colors for packing you
have given a number of containers and
objects and the containers have a
capacity and the objects have a value
and a capacity requirement so you have
containers like this they can be of
different size and then you have objects
you have little objects you have big
objects you have very big objects and
they all have a different values so this
might be not so valuable this might be a
little bit valuable and this might be
very valuable so usually you cannot put
all of these objects here into the
containers so the question is what is
the maximum value that you can put into
the containers and of course you could
have the case that for example the
bigger object is actually worth less
than the smaller object so there's lots
of different combinations here and we'll
actually investigate this problem a
little bit more in one of the next units
now common substring is actually a
misleading name because some people use
this in a wrong way I've seen this
happen before it actually should be
called common sub sequence if somebody
says common substring better ask them if
you know if they don't mean common
subsequence because common substring is
actually not an np-complete problem and
common subsequence is the following
problem you're given two strings so
string 1 and string to say lemonade and
lender and what's the difference between
a substring and a subsequence I
substring is always lots of characters
that are one after the other for a
subsequence you can basically skip
certain characters so E and a is a
subsequence of lemonade but not a
substring and actually we'll do this as
a little brief quiz what is the longest
common subsequence of lemonade and
blender</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
