provide any authentication it does
establish a shared key but it's a shared
key with some unknown entity so it's
maybe really providing no benefit but I
would say that at least establishing the
shared key means now you've got a
channel with some entity that's
encrypted and if someone is
eavesdropping on that channel so if
you're only worried about a passive
adversary they might be able to
eavesdrop on that channel but you do
have a security key established you
don't know that it's with the right
server if there's an active adversary
this definitely provides no benefit
because the active adversary can do the
attack in the middle impersonate the
server establish the key and that's the
one who has the shared key instead of
the server that you intend to talk to if
it's a passive adversary well that
assumes the message actually does get to
the right place so it provides some
security against a passive adversary who
can't intercept or inject new messages
allows you to establish that key but
doesn't provide any authentication so I
think the third answer is the best one
could make arguments for either the
second or the fourth so don't be upset
if you had good arguments for those and
I should emphasize that this establishes
a secure shared key only against a
passive adversary even without worrying
about the authentication since an active
adversary can interfere with a key
that's established so for this protocol
to provide a meaningful benefit it's
necessary that the client actually knows
this Kay u.s. value or has a way to
check it before accepting that this is
the server that she intends to talk with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
