answer such a question is to draw the
finite state machine we come in in state
1 and on a we go to state 2 and on B we
go to state 3 and then from state 2 on
see we go to 4 and state 3 on d we go to
5 and five on egos back to 2 and 5 on f
goes to state six and five on G goes all
the way back here to one and our only
accepting state is 6 well how can we get
to state six if we go up here to the
right this is like the place of no
return we go here and then there's no
way to ever get back down or get to six
so we don't want to go to four we don't
want to get too too how about instead if
we go one three five six or B D F but
now i need to give another string that's
different but that's also accepted one
way to do that would be to take this
hoop go to start back loop here pass go
start again 135 135 6 so B D G B D F
those are two strings that are both
accepted but that are different and if
you are feeling exotic you could
actually have gone around these loops
more times you can add bdg bdg bdg at
the beginning as often as you'd like and
make longer and longer strings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
