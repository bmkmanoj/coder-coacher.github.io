assurance that we have in the system and
we said well we can do testing you can
do formal verification so let's talk
about why that is hard or some of the
challenges that we may face when we're
trying to do that well when you're doing
tests you have to generate the right set
of tests to your test cases test cases
are supposed to show the existence of a
problem if you don't have a good set of
these test cases then a problem that you
may have may go undiscovered in other
words you want to have good code
coverage you want to execute the code
that we have in the software system and
and the kind of execution paths we may
be able to take when the system is
actually deployed the problem with this
is that there could be a very large
impact an exponential number of
different executions that are possible
and these different execution paths
we're talking about I could change when
we have different execution environments
so we talked about the other kind of
testing which is the penetration testing
okay so that's the adversary actually or
somebody else trying to find one way
here when we're doing testing is a good
guy we have to make sure that every
possible execution path we know that is
good so you have the burden of showing
that no matter how the system execute
things will be will not go wrong if you
don't then testing the problem is
different you're not concerned about
every possible execution path you
actually concerned about some execution
path where a problem shows up some
vulnerability you discover that can be
exploited one way we do that is if
ethical hopefully hackers they attempt
to to defeat the security measures that
we have in place if they're successful
that means that we have a problem with
the security measures that we use in our
system if they can't find any that
doesn't mean that somebody else can't
find them you know two weeks from today
but if they they can defeat the security
measures then we know that we have a
problem keep in mind that even with pen
testing as in testing we only talking
about showing the problem existence of a
problem that is there that a problem
exists we can never do more
straight the absence of a problem and
that is formal verification formal
verification is essentially it's a
mathematical specification of what the
program is supposed to do and what
security assertions have to hold would
security properties have to hold and
it's a proof and and the proof is about
the correct behavior of the program or
any executions that the program may go
through so how can we do this well there
are automated theorem proving techniques
things like model checking and all what
they typically do is at our program or
code that we have we'll have a bunch of
state variables with some initial
assignment or values and program
instructions or statements or the code
that we have actually change these state
variables depending on what you know the
instruction of the statement is it may
be you know assigning to new new
variables or altering or computing and
things like that whatever it is doing
but the state changes and then we have
some boolean predicates the correctness
is sort of captured and predicates that
hold on the state variables that we have
and so essentially a model checking or
theorem proving basically saying that
certain security assertion we have is
going to hold as the program executes or
as the state variable change due to the
execution of the program assertions
remain true if you can show that for
everything that the program does of
course all of its statements starting in
in some initial state that is a proof of
correctness or formal verification that
you know whatever that we wanted
actually holds well the problem is that
model checking same sort of difficulty
we had with testing is that the state
space can actually explode and
worst-case complexity is again
exponential however there are starts
being made in this field verification
the problem that we have with it is
would it scale to do really large
systems and your operating system of
course is one of those large systems it
doesn't quite scale to that size system
but as I said you know strides are being
made we can check various kind of
properties and this kind of work
actually something
on second pioneers one the highest award
that computer science has the Turing
award in particular in 2007 because of
the importance or impact this kind of
work could have in not just building a
writing software that implements the
functionality we desired but also
implements the security requirements
that we want to have or security
properties that we want to have in the
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
