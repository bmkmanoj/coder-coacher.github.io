gonna talk about loops but more
importantly you're gonna learn something
that you probably want to know namely
how you can become a millionaire even
though if you think about it right now
interest rates very low get a measly 1%
on your bank account and I don't know
about you but I don't have a lot of
money right now all I have to invest is
a hundred dollars but I have a plan
here's my plan I'm going to set my time
machine to that specific point when my
bank account has a million dollars in it
or maybe if I can't find my time machine
I'll just let myself be cryogenically
frozen and tell them to wake me up at
that moment all I need to know now is to
which date in the future to set my time
machine so that's what we're gonna be
writing a program for and that program
is going to be using loops because it
has to keep on adding that interest to
the bank account until it reaches a
million dollars how long do you think
it's going to take a hundred years a
thousand years ten thousand years or
almost a million years just take a guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
