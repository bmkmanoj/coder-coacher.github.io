board looks like this and you take turns
with another player trying to make a row
of three X's or OS in a row I will play
this all the time with my cousins
because it's so easy to draw out on a
piece of paper but didn't hold our
attention for long most of the time we
would tie and it would get boring really
quickly you can imagine if this were a
game app I wouldn't play it for long
because the pace is too slow and the
game is too predictable to really
attract and keep players interested you
want to make a challenging game when I
think of a challenging game they all
have a few things in common first the
game starts off slowly so that it's easy
to play and understand second the game
complexity grows over time this is
especially important for monetization
because complex difficult portions of
your game can be good places to
introduce in-app purchases that can help
players overcome certain challenges if
you decide to include in that purchases
like this keep in mind that if a game is
too challenging without them it will
detract from the quality of the game and
it can drive players away if they feel
like they're being forced to buy helpful
items in order to advance in the game so
always keep in mind your players and
their game experience because a quality
game experience is the most important
aspect of a challenging game and design
your in-app purchases to be helpful but
not required a good example of a game
that bounces being challenging but not
too challenging is candy crush candy
crush has a lot of levels to progress
through they start off relatively easy
and introduce you to the rules of the
game and as you breeze through the first
couple levels it gives you some winning
momentum the levels get more challenging
over time here you can see the
difference between early level of candy
crush and a later one that's a special
level which includes licorice and
bubbles as extra obstacles and when you
don't quite pass a level it feels like
you are so so close and if you just need
a little extra push the game will offer
you items and power-ups for purchase
that will give you that push and this is
a great example of why it's so important
to plan for monetization early on so
that you can have good timing
and introduced in app purchases right
when players might need an extra boost
but it's hard to know exactly what
challenges are items your game players
will like the best so later in the
course we'll talk about how to test out
different versions of your game like
different challenges are levels to see
what works best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
