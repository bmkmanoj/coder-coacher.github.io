look at shadows this is a little
environment I've built and it's being
lit by a directional light when doing
trivial graphics rending which I'm doing
here shadowing is typically not
supported for instance we can see that
light leaks in under the little roof in
the back of the scene so let's Elena a
towing
now we can see that the scene is being
properly shadowed parts of the
environment that were previously
incorrectly late are now dark this
happens because we are now disabling
light if there is something between the
light source and the geometry by
rotating the light we can also place the
shadow where we want it but there is
still something wrong with the shadows
real-life shadows are typically not as
sharp as what we see here
now we have enabled soft shadows this
looks much more realistic perfectly
sharp shadows comes from assuming the
light sources infinitely small in real
life light sources have size and by
taking it in consideration we get a soft
shadow border this shadow border
separates the shadow into two parts we
call the completely shadowed area the
Umbra and the soft part with the
gradient the penumbra the penumbra
happens in regions of the surface where
the light source is being partially
occluded also note how the penumbra is
being small when the lid is closed to
the occluder and large when it's further
away this wraps up the part about
shadowing thanks for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
