probably more than one sentence that
could have been given here but for me
what I got was that I started with the
person and said Haruto is the person
doing the eating what he ate was a
pepperoni pizza he did it at Pizza Hut
and the time was noon didn't have any
information about the utensils so that's
not included in the sentence that's good
David but here is something interesting
to note it could have been that this was
the input sentence and that this frame
representation got constructed from this
input sentence so how do two became the
subject in the de person and it became
the verb and so on alternatively this
could have been the frame representation
and perhaps the sentence for charities
with language generation from this frame
representation so the frame
representation could potentially act as
an intermediate representation for both
sentence comprehension and for sentence
generation of course was a lot more to
Sanders generation into sentence
comprehension than what we have shown so
