Francisco I'm an attorney specializing
in intellectual property especially
pharmaceutical and biotechnology with a
background in bioethics you know what
are the ethical issues surrounding the
use of specifically hela cells in the
case of Henrietta's story but also the
the issue of using tissues from people
without their consent in general the
researchers who took the cells from
Henrietta's you've already covered you
know they were attempting there were
multiple attempts to find this immortal
cell line and they were taking samples
from anyone they could she was there for
therapeutic treatment when they took the
cell line and at the time that the cells
were harvested from Henrietta Lacks the
Nuremberg trials of the Nazi physicians
who participated in medical experiments
while Kwazii medical experiments in the
concentration camps the one of the first
principles to come out of the Nuremberg
trials is that the voluntary consent of
a human research subject is absolutely
essential and that's been embroidered on
in United States law and ethical
guidelines ever since the informed
consent that any individual
participating in research needs to be
told beforehand they need to have all of
the information that they are able to
understand so that they can agree or not
to participate in the research it must
be fully voluntary it must be fully
voluntary fully informed and fully
voluntary you can't make a voluntary
choice to participate if you don't have
all of the information informed consent
in the United States in the early 1950s
was still a good theory you know
everyone thought that this this sounded
like a great idea but then you have an
uneducated patient in the hospital who
doesn't understand what treatment she's
receiving is no
advocating for herself and in the
context of the time in the context of
the time most physicians would not have
pause to think I should explain to her
why I'm taking this tissue sample and
let her know what I'm going to do with
it today we can discuss some other
examples that sort of behavior still
goes on but it's recognized by the
medical establishment to be an actual
intrusion and invasion of the patient's
autonomy of the human research subjects
at all right now obviously things have
changed since then and incrementally
okay leaps and bounds maybe not as much
as we would have liked well I want you
to speak to that for a second that I
mean did the Henrietta Lacks story
change anything if not at the time
eventually and if not that were there
are other cases that you know had a
bigger impact on how we look at informed
consent well the Henrietta Lacks stories
you know it wasn't known for more than
40 years so when the immortal life of
henrietta lacks was released when
rebecca skloot started publicizing the
story then i think the story has now
become part of a really interesting
movement towards control over personal
genetic information which I think we're
really just seeing the beginnings of
because legally there was never a
recognized right of ownership or control
of your well in the past tissues blood
sample etc before genetic information
could be extracted and used from those
samples but now you know Henrietta Lacks
you mentioned that her descendants are
now sitting on a committee to authorize
the use of the genetic information
gleaned from the HeLa cells likewise
there was a really interesting decision
in 2010 regarding a small Indian tribe
that lives in the Grand Canyon who hid
given blood samples to a university of
arizona researcher for to be used
in diabetes and schizophrenia research
one of the members of the tribe found
out several years after these blood
samples were donated that they were
being used for purposes that the tribe
members had not consent it to the
University of Arizona of course argued
that this was perfectly acceptable they
had the samples they had no right of
ownership to the samples however the
ultimate outcome of this case is that
the tribe was able to dictate that they
would not authorize their blood samples
to be used for anything other than the
original intended purpose and actually
all of the samples that they donated
were destroyed so I mean these are just
a couple of isolated examples case by
case situation is not really setting the
precedent for how we're going to be
managing genetic information that is in
hands of researchers but it's indicative
of an interesting movement towards
people becoming aware of and taking
measures to control the use of their
genetic information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
