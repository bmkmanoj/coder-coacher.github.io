be 1100 the way to see that is if you
look at the X values well they're three
that match 0 1 1 1 those must correspond
to the output where x equals 0 because
we know an and gate has three outputs
that have the value zero and then
there's one that has the value 10 11 so
that must correspond to the x value
having the output 1 and that means the
only way the output could be one is if
both of these represent one so that
means we know the value of B 1 that's
this one so the value of b0 must be the
other one which is 1100 and we can
affect deduce all the lines in the truth
table from this pattern so obviously
this doesn't work we're not hiding the
patterns that are inherent in the logic
functions we're computing by replacing
them with random nonsense we have to do
something so this table is harder to see
and what we have to do is make it so the
outputs are encrypted that we can't tell
the values of the other entries in the
truth table we can only tell the value
of the one that we actually evaluate and
that hides whether it matches any other
values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
