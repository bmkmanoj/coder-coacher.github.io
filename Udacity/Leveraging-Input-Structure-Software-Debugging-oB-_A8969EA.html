see how we can make Delta debugging
faster we must realize that Delta
debugging is a rather dumb algorithm
where dumb means it's rather economical
in terms of assumptions it assumes
nothing about the input structure it
requires little but on the other hand it
gets the job done the interesting thing
is that the more knowledge about the
structure of the input you put into
Delta debugging the more efficient Delta
debugging becomes let me go straight
this by an example when faced with this
20 character input Delta debugging we'll
have to split this into two halves in
the beginning but since Delta debugging
doesn't know about the structure the
division will be right in the middle of
the input if Delta debugging knew
however that the input was HTML then it
may come up with a split that would
occur at the boundaries between HTML
tokens and actual text something like
this for example and if you repeat this
now for the first substring you will see
that we were able to simplify the input
match faster because now our
simplification follows the structure of
the input let me illustrate this with
our example here again we have Delta
debugging as is and we're applying it on
this very input as we just saw when I
press on run we cannot see the
individual runs and in the end one
character after one character is being
removed until we finally see after 29
tests and one assertion we see the final
result the a simplified input select how
can we make Delta debugging aware of the
input structure we have already seen
that Delta debugging works on lists as
well as on character strings so what we
could do is we could split the strain
into individual substrings according to
the input structure and have Delta
debugging work on that list of elements
instead this is such a list of element
first we have the selector then foo and
then the end of select now what we have
to do is we have to adjust our test
function such that it will merge the
individual parts of the list back again
into a string which we do up here we're
using the Python joint function which
takes all the elements in a list and
concatenate them with the first string a
separator in our case and empty string
so the effect of this is that all the
elements that are
s right now will be merged together and
then in the reconstructed entire string
again we search for the Select tag in
our initial setting it took us 30 tests
until we minimize the input so on
characters we have seen it took DD min
29 tests again excluding the assertion
to simplify the input how many tests
will it take on a list of tokens that is
on this list of tokens and here a token
is a substring with the decisive meaning
you can try this out for yourself or
just estimate is this for tests is this
6 test is that 12 tests or is that 29
tests over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
