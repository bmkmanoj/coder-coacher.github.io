because I was also someone who went
through the program myself I went to Y
Combinator in a winter of 2006 the first
batch out here in California and I
founded a company called wufu wufu was
an online form builder it helps you
create online surveys power event
registration and process simple online
payments ran that company for five years
and we then sold that to survey monkey
in 2011 interesting thing about that
company it is not your typical type of
Silicon Valley company after we raised
their funding after demo day we
purposely only raised about a hundred
thousand dollars and then we moved back
to Florida on the east coast and we
operated out of there we never had a
centralized office so it's completely
remote working team and we only grew the
coming to about 10 people on purpose
there was a lot of money offered to us
but we were relatively profitable as a
start-up so we never needed to take any
money from venture capitalists or any
other investors at the time and when we
were acquired one of the interesting
metrics that sometimes we talk about is
that the average company that sold or
required or went IPO that year was about
had raised 25 million dollars and their
average returns to their investors about
six hundred percent wufu only raise a
hundred thousand dollars for the life of
the company and our returns to our
Investor was like twenty nine thousand
percent so a lot of what I work on with
companies that Y Combinator's is
focusing on building the kind of company
that doesn't need to raise money from
other people and being extremely
efficient and productive with the
resources they have at hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
