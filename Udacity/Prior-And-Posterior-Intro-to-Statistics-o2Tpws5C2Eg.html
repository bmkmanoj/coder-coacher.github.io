which that gives you in a second there
are some sort of a prior of which we
mean the probability before you run a
test and then you get some evidence from
the test itself and that all leads you
to what's called a posterior probability
now this is not really a plus operation
in fact in value is more like a
multiplication but semantically what
Bayes rule does is it incorporates some
evidence from a test into your prior
probability to arrive at a posterior
probability so let's make this specific
in our cancer example we know that the
prior probability of cancer is 0.01
which is the same as 1% the posterior of
the probability of cancer given that our
tests as positive abbreviate here as
positive is the product of the prior
times our test sensitivity which is or
the chance of a positive result given
that I have cancer and you might
remember December 0.9 or 90% now just to
warn you this isn't quite correct to
make this correct we also have to
compute the posterior for the non cancer
option Britney has not cancer given a
positive test and that's using the prior
we know that P of not C is 0.99 it's 1
minus P of C times the probability of
getting a positive test result given not
C realize these two equations are the
same that exchange C for not C and this
one over here takes a moment to compute
we know that our test gives us a
negative result if a cancer-free
0.9 chance and as a result it gives us a
positive result in the cancer-free case
with 10% chance now what's interesting
is that this is about the correct
equation except the probabilities don't
add up to 1/2 C I'm going to ask you to
compute those so please give us give me
the exact numbers for the first
expression and the second next
written over here using our example a
