humans all right human vision humans are
much more sensitive to changes in what's
referred to as luminance how bright
something is then they are sensitive to
what color it is now here's an example
now this example may work better or
worse depending upon how your monitor is
set so if you're not seeing the illusion
I'm about to show you play with your
monitor here's two images with text on
them and in the top the background and
the text are actually I'm gonna have to
change color of pens they're the same
color but they're the different
brightness okay different the technical
term is luminance all right and probably
all of you have no problem seeing that
it says text in color without intensity
differences in the left eye on the
bottom actually on the Mac monitor I can
hardly read it on this monitor I can
read it just fine because it depends
upon how each monitor and we're gonna
talk about monitors and gamuts in a
little bit how they show it but you
could have adjusted the color of the
text in there so that the color became
almost what's called ISO illuminant all
right so the same amount of luminance
okay but different colors so you just
basically take the the cyan there or
just make it brighter or darker don't
change its what we're gonna learn it's
called the hue the color and you can
make it go away
right so the bottom line is that the
human system is much better at dealing
with differences in luminance so these
phenomena
try-try stimulus color Theory difference
in luminous this has been the has been
known for a very long time since the
very early 1900s so starting in the
1920s people started doing some what are
called psychophysics experiments by
psychophysicists because who else would
do psychophysics besides
psychophysicists of basically showing
people different kinds of stimuli and
asking them what they see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
