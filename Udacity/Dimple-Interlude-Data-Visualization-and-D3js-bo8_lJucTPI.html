j/s you can find at dimple jas org as I
mentioned dimple is a library built the
top of d3 that allows us to work at the
abstraction level or chart rather than
lower level abstractions like visual
encodings such as shape scale and
positioning the reason i will be using
dimple jas as opposed to another
charting library is threefold as
outlined on their site dimple is built
atop d3 as a very gentle learning curve
and designed for analysts in the last
reason and what pretty unique to dimple
that it exposes the native d three
objects so if you do want to get more
complicated and wean yourself off of
using all of dimples convenience methods
you can access the underlying d three
objects themselves as i mentioned dimple
GIS exists as a tool to make business
analysts more productive with charts but
to allow the flexibility to extend the
visualizations for power users even
though we saw III in lesson 1 we only
manipulated HTML objects and the little
SVG did not get to any data driven
operations we will be using d3 itself to
create interactive visualizations and
animations in Lesson four but for now
since we're only creating charts and
since many awesome libraries exist they
abstract a lot of the complexities of
building charts yourself with d3 we'll
be using the library's instead this
pattern the d3 defines the bind data to
some elements on the page is often over
the most confusing topics for newcomers
to d3 to understand most often due to
the dot enter and exit commands you can
call on your data these are only really
relevant if you're adding and removing
elements on a given webpage in an
animation transition or interaction they
are necessary however for any simple
visualization you do even if you don't
have any interaction around
mission in it rather than explaining
this pattern now and having you wonder
why there's this dot enter or how it
could be used I'll save the explanation
for lesson for when we will fully
understand what's going on behind the
scenes here and how we can leverage it
to create some pretty awesome
interactive animations and
visualizations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
