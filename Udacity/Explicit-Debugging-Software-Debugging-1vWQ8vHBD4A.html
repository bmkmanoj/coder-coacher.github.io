debugging late in the night with your
significant other calling you and your
not knowing what to do let me know come
up with a way to avoid all of this the
answer here is explicit debugging what
does expressive debugging mean it's
simple when you're debugging late in the
night that's usually because you try to
keep everything in your head you're
making the hypothesis in your head
you're running the experiments and
keeping the results of the experiments
in your head this is okay for five
minutes but the longer this goes on the
harder it becomes to actually memorized
all of this and this is why everything
gets so intense you're so concentrated
on trying to figure out what's going on
and this is why nobody can disturb you
because then you'd get out of your
trends the alternative to this implicit
debugging we're keeping everything in
your head of course is explicit
debugging explicit debugging it first
simply means to write down what you're
doing make notes of what you see make
note of what you expect and make note of
what your current hypothesis is common
format for this for instance is to write
down what input was or generally what
the experiment is what you expected to
see and what you get instead you may
even want to write down the current
hypothesis you're working on and whether
this hypothesis is confirmed or rejected
this way you keep a log of your actions
and this log gives you multiple
advantages to start you can always
revise what you actually did and what
the result was so you don't have to
memorize it and you don't have to repeat
it second you can resume the session at
any time because everything is already
written down you don't have to store
this in your head when your significant
other calls you and asks you out for a
nice dinner well everything is written
down and you can resume the next morning
with a fresh mind and a nice dinner on
top the third advantage however is that
when you write things down and see
them again this often already bears the
solution at hand because forcing you to
become explicit frequently makes it
clear to you what the problem actually
is so it structures your thinking it
helps you organize your thinking towards
successful debugging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
