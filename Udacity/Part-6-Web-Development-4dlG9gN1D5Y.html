about yamo files people had problems
getting the animal files configured
correctly could you go into what exactly
that is and what you need in it sure and
so it's so to Z to the extent that I can
so I like you I'm also a little bit new
to Google App Engine a llaman file is
just this configuration file that app
engine uses and it defines you know what
what the main file of your of your app
is going to be like what file doing a
load first in Python what libraries need
to be loaded app engine runs in this
kind of the sandbox situation that might
not be the right word but basically
libraries that you have installed on
your system aren't necessarily
accessible and libraries that ship with
App Engine aren't necessarily acceptable
accessible and App Engine unless you
tell the llamo file hey I want to use
this library this helps Google
presumably deploy your code properly
when they when they deploy it on their
machines so it's not a difficult piece
of technology basically if you don't
know i would ask in the forums I mean
that's why I've been doing a lot of
googling myself to get my llamo file in
order and that's sort of the nature of
the business try to stay out of these
configuration files as much as we can
I'll try to include you know I when we
make my code available include the Yama
file that i've been using which is very
simple you know I've just based it on
the hello world examples from the App
Engine website okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
