lesson 2 optionals here's an example of
what I mean when I say nil is disallowed
in most Swift types if I declare an
invariable X and try to assign it an
lvalue i get the following error message
cannot assign a value of type nil to a
value of type in ants can't store nil
values and neither can any of the other
primitive types this isn't all that
surprising it's more surprising to see
that object references can't store nail
values here's a reference to a UI color
object it can store a uicolor uicolor
dot red color but not know that's
unusual this isn't true in Java C++ Ruby
Python c-sharp objective-c they all have
nil or null or some special value that
stands in for now notice that even if we
change the variable C to be an object of
type any object the datatype for a
general object reference we can see that
it still can't store nil in a way this
is cool this means null pointer
exceptions are impossible but what about
situations for which we need nil values
let's think under what conditions would
a value need to be nil let's explore the
two most common scenarios the first has
to do with values returned from methods
there are some cases in which it
wouldn't make sense for a method to
return a value a good example is this
init method this method is used to
initialize an int from a string but not
all strings can be converted to ents
what should happen when s2 is converted
to an int it definitely can't return an
integer value but throwing a fatal error
isn't a much better alternative we can
see that the compiler agrees something
is wrong here it's important than a
method like this int initializer can
return something that represents no
value or none declaring y as a type int
isn't enough we need a type that has two
options either an int value or no value
we can't pretend that nil values don't
exist another common scenario that we'll
see especially when working with UI kit
has to do with properties of instances
often classes have properties that can't
be initialized until after an instance
is constructed consider this simple view
controller notice that the compiler
won't allow me to add this button
property why is that the problem is that
the button is a regular swift variable
and Swift variables can't store nil
values so what value should this button
members store when a view controller is
created just like the method return
types before in this situation we need
options we often need to instantiate a
view controller first and then
initialize its properties later this is
especially true when we're using
storyboard Swift needs a way for this
button variable to either have a button
value or to be nil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
