and when I say back I took a whole week
off so basically I have no idea where we
are so hopefully you'll be more get your
act together than I do I think last time
we were talking something about Lucas
kannadi method of solving for optical
flow or promotion and if you remember we
had this problem with optical flow that
we refer to as the aperture problem the
aperture problem was if you look at a
little local area and you can only tell
the mood the motion that is in the
direction of the gradient perpendicular
to the edge so basically to solve that
we had to impose some form of
constraints first we did the global
constraint then we did the local
constraints of lukasik kannadi and the
idea was by having these local
constraints we could have more than one
equation per pixel and the basic idea
was to pretend that all the pixels were
moving in the same direction in a little
local neighborhood so we would sum up
over that window instead of five by five
window you'd have 25 equations per pixel
and that basically gave us this least
square solution and we related that to
the whole harris corners where we said
that if the matrix here a transpose a if
that matrix was well conditioned meant
we had two decent sized eigenvalues it
meant that the gradient occurred in
various directions over that window and
we mentioned how this method of
recovering how something moved was first
proposed by lukes kannadi in 1981 but
critical to the whole derivation was the
idea that we use this Taylor series
expansion that is that we could
approximate how something would move or
how much the intensity would change but
essentially fitting a planar ramp that
was the first order derivative
approximation taking a planar ramp to a
point and then as the point would move
the intensity would change according to
the slope on that ramp but of course
there were certain assumptions built
into Lukas kannadi that were sometimes
problematic so the main assumption was
that the pixel hasn't moved didn't
change its color didn't change its
intensity so if brightness constancy
doesn't hold and you have to do
something in terms of feature detection
finding a feature from one place to
another and we've already talked about
doing sift detection and
characterization in order to do these
these matches and we can combine those
in fact we're not going to about talk
very end about how you can find dense
estimation with sift estimation the
other thing we said is that possibly a
bunch of points are moving one way and
other points are moving another way so
in that area it within a window you
don't actually have all the points
moving in the same direction and you
have to solve that with a motion
segmentation we mentioned that will
actually go over sort of a mechanism of
doing that not at the end of this
lecture but at the end of the the next
one oh these aren't lectures these are
videos so that makes them sound like
they're more fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
