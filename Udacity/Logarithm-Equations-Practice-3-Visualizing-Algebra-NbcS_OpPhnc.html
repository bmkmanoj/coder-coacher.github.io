but we'll start it out just the same way
as before we'll change the logarithmic
form into exponential form will have MS
or base negative 4 as the exponent and
one-sixteenth as the result so we know m
to the negative 4 equals one sixteenth
since we're looking for the space M we
want this to look like something raised
to the negative fourth power if the
powers match then we know what M is well
we can rewrite one-sixteenth as 16 to
the negative first power remember a
negative exponent makes a reciprocal so
16 to the negative 1 equals 1 16th now
we can rewrite 16 as 2 to the fourth
we'll have 2 to the fourth which is 16
raised the negative first power now we
can simplify this line we know that when
we raise the power to another power we
really multiply them together so 2 to
the fourth raised to the negative 1
equals 2 to the negative fourth now this
exponent and this exponent are the same
so we know that the bases must also be
equal for these numbers to both be equal
to one another this is how we get a
value for m equal to positive 2 nice
solving if you got this correct I know
it was tough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
