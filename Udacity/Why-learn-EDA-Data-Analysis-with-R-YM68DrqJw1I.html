learn about exploratory data analysis in
the first place
hal varian the chief economist at Google
said what's becoming ubiquitous and
cheap data and what's complimentary to
data analysis in general terms
exploratory data analysis or EDA is the
examination of data and relationships
among variables through both numerical
and graphical methods it often takes
place before more formal more rigorous
statistical analyses EDA is often the
first part of a larger process it can
lead to insights or new questions or
even feed into the process of building
predictive models it's also an important
line of defense against bad data it's an
opportunity to check some of your
assumptions and intuitions about a data
set many times business decisions are
made using unpolished visualizations
that come out of exploratory data
analysis other times you might polish
some of those visualizations or
summaries before presenting them to a
larger audience let's hear from Chris
about an example of how EDA can fit into
the larger process of building
predictive models a great example of EDA
comes from the Netflix prize competition
teams competed for a million-dollar
prize to improve the Netflix movie
recommendation system by at least 10%
you can read more about the contest and
the results by clicking on the link in
the instructor notes this visualization
was created by Todd Holloway to show
clusters of movies based on user ratings
movies that are closer together receive
similar user ratings whether those
ratings were high or low and it's
exactly this type of visualization that
allows us to get a feel for the data and
determine what could be part of it and
what could be explored in more depth so
even before performing complex analyses
on the data we can learn a lot about
visualizing our data
Nathan Yau a noted statistician and
visualization guru provides his
reflections about this plot you can read
his thoughts and check out the
interactive visualization from the
instructor notes as well so whether you
want to learn an in-demand skill or
compete in million
our competitions EDA has something to
offer to you at the least learning about
EDA will improve your ability to reason
through data sharpen your communication
skills and expand your career
opportunities now I want you to take a
few minutes to think about your previous
work and your educational experiences
write a few sentences about where you
would like to learn about EDA and once
you've got your ideas down share your
thoughts and your experiences in the
forum and remember there's no right or
wrong answer here this question is just
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
