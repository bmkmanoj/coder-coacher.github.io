abstract it is actually quite realistic
because it is similar to many real-world
apt instances in this example the CEO
gets an email with a PDF attachment
showing pie charts of sales activities
when it opens the PDF document inside
browser for example so that he can use
the acrobat reader plugin to view the
document the crafted attack data
embedded in the PDF document would cause
a zero-day exploit that broke out the
plug-in sandbox in a browser and
compromised the browser in a detail of
such attack CEM bees for example a
buffer overflow attack LD to control
flow hijacking and taken over the
browser then the injected attack code
would download a malicious browser
extension recall that a malicious
browser extension is a malware embedded
within the browser from this point on
each time the CEO sends an email to his
employees with an attachment for example
a PDF document the malicious browser
extension would in fact the attachments
eventually the malware gets on the
computer of a user who has a min
privilege of the company's server and
therefore the malware can steal the
credentials that will lead the malware
into access to the company's servers
from this point on the malware can then
steal the most valuable data from the
company this example captures a number
of key Kadri sticks of apts first the
users including Asus Emmons do not
realize that their computers and network
have been compromised second the APD
activity is planning with normal user
activity for example the apt does not to
send email by self
he only modifies the emails sent by the
CEO third it takes its time in order to
get to the key individual and steal his
credentials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
