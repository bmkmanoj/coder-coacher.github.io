this universality finding was really
opened up research on emotion in the
face and emotion more generally because
for much of the 20th century people had
not studied emotion because it was
considered something inherently
subjective that you could not measure
and us and if you think about what's
been going on in psychology during this
time behavior ism everything has to be
observable how could you study something
is private and ism as an emotion is
finding on the face suddenly suggested
which earlier research and psychology
had not suggested that there was
reliable information about emotion in an
observable modality in the face so it
became clear that we could study
emotions from the outside not just from
the inside and in order to kind of
potentiate this work make it more likely
ekman and fries and developed a
measurement tool to enable the objective
studying of facial behavior from the
outside they developed the facial action
coding system the acronym for that is
FAC s or fax which is an elaborate
detailed observational system
observational meaning it relies on human
observation to code all observable
facial movement without saying what it
is so it's purely descriptive and that
really opened up an enormous amount of
opportunity in emotion research just
said emotional behavior objectively to
do it without drawing people's attention
to it you know because you could video
record and then code the behavior later
each emotional expression has a unique
pattern of facial right but it's
important to understand that fax is not
just for emotion facts is for describing
facial movement you can see which
actions occur together to describe any
expression on the face so I'm going to
give another little demonstration right
now let me back up faqs describes all
facial muscle actions in terms of
arbitrary action units so it separates
all facial behavior in terms of what
each muscle does so if I lift the inner
corner of the eyebrow that's one action
each action has an arbitrary numeric
code so this is action
unit 1 this is 2 this is 4 this is 5
this is 6 I could go through the whole
face there are 44 different action units
to describe the individual components of
facial action and then you can see
whatever the face does and describe it
in terms of these components so if I
take one of the emotion expressions that
I modeled earlier like anger this has
the brow lower which is actually unit
for lifting the upper eyelid is action
unit 5 tightening the lower eyelid is 7
pressing the lips together and pushing
the chin up is 17 and 24 so we have a 4
or 5 7 17 and 24 so you can describe any
facial action and one of the interesting
applications of the facial action coding
system has been in computer animation in
fact it's become the gold standard in
the visual effects industry for
developing virtual beings ritual actors
you know it was used in avatar it was
used in in Harry Potter was used in any
animated creature they use the action
units as the basis for animating our
faces so in fact that yeah that leads to
my next question which is can you tell
us something about how you've applied
facts or facial action coding system in
your own work it's been really
interesting because my original intent
was to study emotion and that's why I
got into studying the face so I've
applied facts to my own research on
emotion where I've looked at things like
the role of anger and heart disease but
that was my dissertation research I've
also looked at the relationship between
facial expression and people's reports
of emotional experience and how emotions
change as a function of more recently
meditation training sess in my research
but as a result of becoming expert in
facts I've learned that a lot of people
are interested in this measurement tool
for other reasons so I've trained
animators like people who do visual
effects animation I worked on the
television show lie to me which was on
from 2009-2011 on Fox and this was a
drama based on
really Paul Ackman's career so that the
lead character in that was a deception
detection expert and the field of
deception detection depends a lot on
facial movement detection so I was a
scientific consultant on that show
reading scripts coaching the actors etc
so it's really run the gamut from basic
research to something really applied
like in the entertainment industry and
sort of a continuous thing throughout
all of those is is facts the facial
measurement and and that the kinds of
people I've trained in that right yeah
right great well thank you I hope you've
enjoyed this and also see that how
psychology can be applied in a lot of
different areas in ways that you may not
have expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
