statement syntax in Jinja the statement
syntax is very simple it just looks like
this you say squiggle percent and then
you have your statement and then you
have a close squiggle percent and then
you often have a an ending statement
which is surrounded by schools of course
and in the middle you have your output
for example an if statement like might
look something like this so I'll say if
name equals equals Steve this is just a
Python syntax for an if statement notice
there's no colon at the end will print
hello Steve else will print who are you
this whole thing is followed by the end
statement block which in this case just
says and if now this is because you know
in Python we have white space to know
when blocks and in another language we
have different curly brace things in
Jinja you have to tell it when the if
statement is actually over so this will
do when this is run if the variable name
Steve or if the variable named name
equals Steve it'll say hello Steve else
it'll say who are you and then this ends
it let's go ahead and see this in
practice ok I'm going to get the
variable n from the request and n will
be a number and we're going to change
this to be N equals n we're going to go
into our template and we're going to
change this we're it's going to work in
the same template here if you don't mind
we're going to change this to use a
basic if statement so if n equals 1 say
N equals one else the N does not equal 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
