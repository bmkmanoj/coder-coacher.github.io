displays games on a separate row than
apps to make your game appear here as
well as to have it listed as an android
TV game on the Google Play Store there's
a couple quick updates we need to make
to your manifest first we'll add this
line to indicate your app as a game next
declare support for game controllers and
be sure to always set the required flag
to false even if your game requires one
this might seem a bit counterintuitive
and the reason is that game pads are
accessories and they might not be
connected at the time of purchase so if
you accidentally set the required flag
to true users might actually have
trouble installing your game from the
Play Store if their game controller
isn't connected if you actually do
require a gamepad instead just check if
it's connected when your game starts up
as a refresher carefully check your
manifest hardware requirements also pay
attention to imply to hardware
requirements that can come about because
of permissions when you find a piece of
hardware that supported on a mobile
device but not TV like a sensor market
is optional then at runtime check what
device you're running on or whether your
device has a certain type of hardware
before you try and use it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
