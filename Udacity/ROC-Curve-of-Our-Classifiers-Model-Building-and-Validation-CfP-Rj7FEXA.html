concepts in our OSI analysis the first
one is the ISO performance lines the
idea here is very simple if you draw a
line through ROC space then the points
in the ROC curves that intersect with
the straight line have the same
performance and this performance is
measured by the slope of this line the
gray line that I drew intersected the
ROC curves in one two three four five
points all these points have the same
performance and thus they fall on ISO
performance line so you see these lines
can be determined by the objective of
optimization such as the lines that can
give maximum accuracy or specificity or
sensitivity another important concept is
the concept of the area under the curve
an ROC curve with a larger area under it
performs better on average than an ROC
curves that has a smaller area in our
case here you see the Green Line has a
lesser area than the red line under it
thus the SVC performs better than the
logistic regression since a greater AUC
or area under the curve implies better
performance in our case we choose the
random forest classifier as it performs
best on average given the area under the
curve is the greatest one very
interesting property of the ROC curve is
that it is invariant under the class
distribution and thus the results are
applicable to a data set with different
proportion of class instances what this
means is that it doesn't matter as far
as the ROC analysis goes as to which
class has how many points to train upon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
