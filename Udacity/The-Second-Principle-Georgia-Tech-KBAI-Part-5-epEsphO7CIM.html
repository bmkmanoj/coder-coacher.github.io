was it learning in kpa agents is often
incremental this means information or
data or experiences arrive one at a time
this is one of the key differences
between knowledge-based AI and other
forms of AI like machine learning in
those forms a large amount of
information is often given right at the
beginning here our agents learn step by
step incremental e we first encountered
this with learning by recording cases
our agents learned each individual case
one by one the experiences themselves
were the increments in this learning
strategy case based reasoning also
operated on individual cases but it
organized them into much more complex
knowledge structures like tagging them
in an array or organizing them by
discrimination tree but the fundamental
object of knowledge were still
individual cases that arrived one by one
we did a complex exercise where one by
one we added these new cases in our
discrimination tree in criminal concept
learning was as the title suggests
incremental here we received positive
and negative examples one at a time
based on the difference between our
current concept and our new example and
whether or not the new example was a
positive or negative example we would
change our concept this was always done
example by example incremental e version
spaces involved a very similar kind of
knowledge here experiences came one at a
time and we generalize a specific model
and specialized the general model to
converge down to an understanding of the
concept finally learning by correcting
mistakes is also deeply incremental here
the individual mistakes arrived
incrementally and based on the
individual mistakes our agent modified
its knowledge base to repair the cause
of the previous mistake the takeaway
here is in many of our methods and
learning reasoning and memory all
involve dealing with information that
comes incremental II bit by bit instead
of processing a large amount of data all
at the same time one can also see this
connects more closely to human
experience where we're constantly
experiencing the world experience by
experience instead of being given a
lifetime of experiences all at once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
