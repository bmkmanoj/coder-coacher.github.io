lucas-kanade e or at least the one that
in some sense is most problematic and
yet fixable is this idea that we can use
that Taylor series approximation so the
idea of that Taylor series approximation
is that we can make a small ramp
estimate that is the first linear
first-order linear estimate and then as
things move a little bit that'll tell us
how things change and we've gone over a
one method we talked about nonlinear
iterative refinement so that if it's if
it's still the right model in terms of
the point nearby is changing but it's
not linear maybe it's a quadratic or
something we use a bunch of linear
successive approximations but actually
that's not the problem that exists small
most often the one that exists most
often is that actually pixel motion is
not small and so you can't just assume
that you can tell how things have
changed by just doing a very local
analysis so to solve that we have to do
something called coarse to fine
estimation to illustrate what I mean
here's a simple example so here you see
on this one on the left side I have
curves that have been shifted by only a
small amount so when I find one point
value the nearest match is actually the
correct displacement so if I actually
fit a little slope through here I can do
my local estimate and I'll eventually
find the correct match but over here
I've got a different situation so
there's one point the nearest match will
now be this red point right so it
basically has just estimated the change
to be that much all right where the
actual shift of course is much much more
all right
and so the estimated shift is is too
small so the question is how would you
fix that so let's take a look at this on
a real picture so here's an example on
some real pictures so this is two frames
taken out of the MPEG Garden sequence
and what you can see is that I've got
one frame and then the next frame the
tree moves to left quite a bit because
the camera has moved to the right and
you can see the tree in the front is
including the tree in the back okay so
question do you think that this is a
small enough motion to be able to run
Lukasik annatee
no look there's a lot more than one
pixel or a small number of pixel motion
with a planar assumption between I'm
uncovering entire trees in the
background right so the problem is you
know how could we solve this right how
can we eliminate this problem of large
pixel motion and I'm gonna show you with
a single slide you're gonna look at it
you're gonna go aha I get it ready now
aha I get it what do you get okay here's
what you got and the top-left corner is
the original sequence all right and you
can see that the thing is moving a whole
bunch of pixels I don't know maybe it's
moving let's call it seven on the top
right you'll notice the picture is drawn
the same size but I've actually reduced
the pixels in half so now it says
there's like 90 pixels across right
before there's something 180 well gee if
I was moving seven pixels before now I'd
only be moving three and a half pixels
ah do it again now I've only got 45 ish
pixels bottom left-hand corner now
instead of moving three and a half well
half of three nine one one in three
quarters okay that's still more than one
isn't it yes okay well cut it in half
again so now I have this picture on the
bottom right and if you look at that
animation you'll see you can sort of see
it shifting within the pixels it's
actually less than a one pixel motion
okay it's a very blurry picture and I
don't make it really blow it up and now
you can actually see each pixel in there
but you can see that the motion is a sub
pixel motion so basically what we want
to do is we want to implement a motion
recovery method that takes this coarse
image and then iteratively or I should
say multi scale wise goes to a finer and
finer image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
