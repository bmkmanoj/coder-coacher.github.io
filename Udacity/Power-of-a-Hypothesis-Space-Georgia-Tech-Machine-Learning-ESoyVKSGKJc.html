measure the power of a hypothesis space
this is a really clever definition I did
not come up with this and it goes like
this
for a given input and hypothesis space
we're gonna ask what is the largest set
of inputs that the hypothesis class can
label in all possible ways so in this
example that we were looking at it's
actually really simple because it turns
out the answer is 1 so here's here's an
example so being able to do this with 1
is not such a big deal if s is a set of
points a set of inputs in this case just
six it's one of the inputs from the set
then are there hypotheses in the
hypothesis class that can label this in
all possible ways well there's only two
possible ways it can label it as true
and it can label it as false so here we
if we set theta to I don't know 5 it'll
label it as true if we have a different
hypothesis that say sets theta to 8 then
we can label it as false there is a set
of input of size 1 that we can label in
all possible ways but is there any pair
of inputs that we can label in all four
ways I'm gonna say no and why is that
well because you're writing it you're
writing as sets but I sort of think of
these as points on a number line and
theta as a separating line and there's
just kind of no way to label anything to
the left of the line is negative ever
because you're requiring that X is
greater than equal to theta to be
positive so you can never label anything
to the left of that line it's negative
so all I have to do right is make X 1
negative and X 2 positive and there's
nothing you can do is that right indeed
it is
so in particular pick any two points X 1
X 2 on the line just like you said if as
we roll theta as we just kind of
consider sets of data is moving from
left to right it starts off where X 1
and X 2 are both going to be labeled is
true then as we move theta to the right
X 1 is going to eventually start to be
labeled false so that's okay that's now
two of the combinations we've seen we're
gonna keep moving theta to the right and
now X two is labeled as false so we've
seen three of the combinations but which
combination didn't we see
true/false and there's just no way to
make that happen just like you said so
would you say this was a weak hypothesis
space it definitely seems to be pretty
weak even though it's infinite in fact
did it depend on X being finite no
actually it didn't right yeah so all so
this really applies in this very general
setting we can take this definition
bring it to bear on an input hypothesis
pair like this and it gives us a sense
of how expressive or how powerful the
hypothesis space is and in this case not
very expressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
