one where you'll brainstorm ideas for
your app and you'll also build a
skeleton UI and kind of start looking at
some api's and libraries now if you are
in the iOS developer nanodegree and you
were following along with the
interspersed lessons you can skip this
lesson and move on to lesson 2 because
in lesson 2 is where we're going to
start choosing an idea for our App
thinking through features building
through a paper prototype and then
actually building and testing our app
will do lots of user testing in this
phase to help us find bugs and also make
sure that people want to actually use
your app then in lesson three you'll
reflect on the process and you'll think
about those things that maybe you do
differently or you could do better
because as developers if we're going to
get better we have to think about those
things that were kind of not so great at
now also this course is only going to
teach you to build an app we're not
going to talk about monetizing it or
building a business if you're interested
in that Udacity has an entrepreneurship
management nanodegree which is a great
option if you're a budding entrepreneur
and you want to make a business out of
an iphone app there's a link to it in
the instructor notes if you want to go
check that out now as we continue this
is going to be a wonderfully messy and
creative and awesome but sometimes
frustrating journey and it's often said
that the journey of 100 miles begins
with a single step so let's take that
step now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
