function to build your own interactive
debugger we're going to call this my
spider for my simple Python debugger
with the idea of a spider being
something that catches all the bugs my
spider is a super simple debugger as it
says in the name my spider is a
command-line debugger so it prompts you
to enter a command and a command can be
something like break in line 17 run the
program and when it reaches 970 it stops
and as it has stopped we can print
individual variables for instance X and
X saying has a value of 42 how do we do
that
we need a number of variables that
control how the debugger works first a
variable name stepping which tells us
whether we are stepping line by line
through the program or whether we're
just running the program we also have a
list of breakpoints actually it's a
mapping of individual line numbers to
arbitrary values but if this mapping say
has an entry for the number seven this
means that whenever the debugger reaches
line seven then execution should stop
for our current setting we'll make a
life simple we'll have a number of
predefined breakpoints we will have for
instance a breakpoint in line nine and
possibly another one in line 14 our
trace each function is being called for
every single line and of course we want
our debugger to stop whenever either a
breakpoint is reached or when we're
stepping from one line to the next we
want to access these global variables so
we need to declare them accordingly if
the event is that we reached a new line
we check if we're stepping or if our
breakpoints dictionary has availed you
for the current line and if this
actually is the case we print out
appropriate diagnostic information which
may be helpful for the debugger what has
happened where we currently are the
function that's executed as well as the
local variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
