us an interesting way to think about
randomness it's certainly a useful
notion in many areas of computer science
but it's not going to give us a
practical way to tell if the sequence is
random it won't even give us a
theoretical way to do that because it's
uncomputable the next thing we might
think about trying is statistical tests
and this is in fact often used as part
of an argument that something produces
random numbers and it should be part of
that argument but it can never be the
whole argument that the only thing we
can do with a statistical test is show
that something is non-random we can't
ever prove that it is random we could
always find some non-random sequence
that satisfies all of our statistical
tests so we're left with our best
argument is how the sequence is actually
generated if we know how the sequence is
produced we could have some confidence
that it satisfies the randomness
requirements we have at least for
generating a good key and the real
requirement there is unpredictability
that we want to know if our sequence is
a sequence of numbers like this where
each X I is on the range 0 to 2 to the N
minus 1 that even an attacker who's seen
the first M numbers in the sequence can
only guess the next one with the same
probability they would have if they were
just guessing by chance
only one out of two to two then the size
of the elements in the sequence so
that's the property we want if we're
going to get that property and we can't
do it by using kamagra of complexity
because that's uncomputable we can't do
it with statistical tests because they
can only show down randomness the way
we're going to try to achieve that is by
generating the sequence in a way that
produces values that are unpredictable
to the attacker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
