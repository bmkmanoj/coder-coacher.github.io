equals 3 plus or minus root 7 all
divided by two fantastic work if you
found these solutions I know they were
tough you might have tried factoring
here but it turns out that we can't for
factoring we would have had to find
factors of positive 2 that's sum to
negative 6 but we know the only factor
pairs are positive 2 and positive 1 and
negative 2 and negative 1 neither of
those pairs sum to negative 6 so we
can't use factoring we also can't use
the root method here we don't have a
perfect square on one side of the
equation completing the square it would
also not work since our a value is
positive 2 we would want the a value to
be positive 1 and the B value to be even
in order to complete the square so using
this quadratic formula we have a equal
to to be equal to negative 6 and C equal
to positive 1 we plug the values of a B
and C into their positions to get this
expression the root of 36 minus eight is
the root of 28 and we know we can
simplify this route into to route 7 next
we factor a 2 from the numerator leaving
us with this expression we cancel the
common factor of 2 that appears the
numerator and in the denominator which
leaves us with our most simplified form
our answers we factor a 2 from these two
terms to get this expression then we
cancel the common factor of 2 and the
numerator and the denominator to get our
final answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
