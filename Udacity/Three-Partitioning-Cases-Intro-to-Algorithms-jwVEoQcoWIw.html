random and it just so happens that it
partitions to something bigger than K so
this is case three here what happens at
this point well all the values get
separated out and so all the ones
smaller than V end up over here and all
the ones bigger than V end up over here
and we haven't really solved the problem
yet but we have made it a lot smaller so
consider at this point the list the L
Prime from here to here this is a list
of elements the top K of this list is
going to be exactly the top K of the
original list because the one that worth
the values that we're throwing out here
can't possibly be in the top K so what
we can do at this point is look again
for the top K but now just do it on the
the sub list of L from zero to the rank
of V so by picking V we've actually just
made this problem smaller so great now
we've handled two of the three cases one
case it's completely solved in another
case we have a smaller version of the
same problem what about the third case
so the third case is when the rank of V
is smaller than K so we do a partition
and the V that we happen to pick is off
to the left here so what that means is
we've now separated the list into
elements that are smaller than this V
value over here and elements that are
bigger than this V value over here and
what do we know about this initial list
well we know that this actually is in
the top K but we don't know about what's
going on in the rest of the world over
here but we learned enough to have made
some progress so again we're going to
recurse now what do we need to do well
we have a this is the list that we are
still unsure about which is and there
could be some off by ones in here but
just to give you the basic idea from the
rank of V from this position here to the
end of the list here's what we care
about but we don't want to find the top
K of this we want to find the top K
minus rank of V why because we already
know that these these elements here
are already in the top K so we only
really need to care about what's left
the K minus rank V that we haven't found
yet so those are the three cases that we
care about and you know you ought to be
able to code this up and and actually
find the top k in this list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
