and I'm here representing being
identified with the bracha to mutation
um tight can you tell us a little bit
more what what is the bracket in
mutation that you have and what does it
mean well I have the one mutation asst
that was tested and reported is 617 for
Del T and it is a pretty common mutation
in Ashkenazi Jewish people and an uncle
of mine is also has the same mutation
and my cousin his daughter when did you
find out you have the mutation I found
out in early 2010 and it was a surprise
I did the 23andme genetic testing and
the results came back and it was
surprising and what did they tell you it
means what like when you have this
mutation what does it mean what is for
you for an individual well the risk of
breast cancer is increased compared to
the general population and the risk of
ovarian cancer is increased and you know
what those increased risk were what
those percentages were well for the
breast cancer risk it's between twenty
and fifty percent risk although I saw a
higher number earlier when I looked
recently it seems like the risk the
number i saw changed and for ovarian
cancer the risk is much lower but the
risk is higher than in the general
population you can also calculate the
risk based on age so compared to the
general population the risk for breast
cancer at my age of 70 is about 4.5 out
of 100 compared to about 2.5 at
for not a woman at age 70 who does not
have the bracha mutation I see and what
did you think about this whole sort of
probability issue you know the idea of a
percentage I mean I think a lot of
people think genetics is going to tell
them oh I am or I'm not going to have
this trait what was running through your
mind a lot I am married to a physicist
who understands statistics and he must
have explained this to me half a dozen
times now I could focus on was the high
number but of course as you get older
the risk it changes it varies assuming
that there are a hundred people 100
women with the bracha mutation and 50 of
already 50 out of 100 have already had
breast cancer then the statistics change
that I can't really explain it but it is
daunting to think that there's you know
double the risk of someone else my age
even if it is a low number however if
you have the mutation there's as far as
i understand it there's in my particular
case i'm missing the teeth and the whole
gene shifts the the bracha gene is
shifting and there is a mutation and so
it's not operating correctly as is my
best understanding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
