online and they just came in the mail
today so wait is the needle in the box
no needle in the box because there's no
blood needed here I'm just saliva that's
going to be sufficient to get genomic
information and do the analysis ok I'll
go ahead let's open it up and see what
we've got the first thing you'll notice
is that they're eight steps described in
the lid of the box and so we'll just
follow those ok and what should I do
next is get this open up this plastic
container and see what's inside what's
inside here there's no needle it's just
a tube look it says to fill up to the
line here that's right that's a couple
teaspoons of saliva so it's not a whole
lot but it can take a while ok let's
start spitting ok
i won I feel my not first I think you'd
be me ok Joanna what's next all right
next thing you're gonna do is close the
cap because that will mix the
preservative with your saliva and that
will help preserve the sample until it
gets to lab okay it looks great um so
now you're going to remove the funnel
cap okay so we just unscrew it unscrew
it oh it's so messy and you can just put
that down somewhere safe here uh-huh but
now we can help it there's a separate
little cap so put that other cap and
that's for man like the mailing cap and
now what you want to do is to make sure
the preservative mixes with the saliva
turn it up and down a couple times to
make sure it gets well mixed and then
find the plastic bag in in the container
there alright so once it's closed you
can put it right into the plastic bag
and you want to seal that up by pulling
off the blue strip okay the very last
step is to put the plastic bag with your
tube into the box okay and you're going
to seal that box up okay make sure the
adhesive is sticky and closes tightly
and it's already pre-addressed so it's
ready to put in the mailbox and it'll go
straight to our lab in Los Angeles great
now before you drop your sample in the
mail you want to make sure that your kid
is registered to you all this means is
that you need to go to the 23 Emmy
website and click on register kit then
you'll have an opportunity to take the
ID number on the side of the spit tube
and associate it with your account that
way when you get your results back 23
Emmy knows that they're your results now
in the meantime you might be wondering
about all the cool results you may find
out from your sample so why don't you
tell us here what's one trait you're
really interested in learning more about
genetically speaking go ahead and put
your answer in the text box here and try
to limit your response to one word if
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
