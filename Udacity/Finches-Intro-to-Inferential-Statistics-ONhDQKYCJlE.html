lessons you may have noticed our
examples have been centered around
social science like social networking
with the cloud example and your
engagement in class but in this lesson
in the next we'll be using a lot of
examples from the fields of biology and
medicine since statistics is heavily
used in those fields as well
I drew a Finch here and that's because
this next example deals with the beak
width of finches specifically scientists
have looked at finches to make
hypotheses about evolution by mapping a
trait over time like beak width we can
tell if the environment is selecting for
a particular size of beak width
maybe there's a particular beak size
that better helps this Finch survive but
sometimes there are random fluctuations
in beak width due to variation in the
population some finches just have bigger
beak width Stan others therefore to
determine whether there is a significant
change in beak width within the
population over time we need to use
statistics if the mean beak width does
significantly increase or decrease in
size this is referred to as directional
selection then the environment allows
the survival and reproduction of finches
with bigger be quits let's say we know
that the average beak width of all
finches is 6.0 7 millimeters this
includes finches that have been studied
over the last few years but now let's
say we're studying a sample of finches
from today we want to know do finches
today have be kids that are different in
size that means our null hypothesis is
that the population mean for finches
today is equal to what they have been
and what should the alternative
hypothesis be that new is less than 6.07
greater than 6.0 7 or not equal to six
point zero 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
