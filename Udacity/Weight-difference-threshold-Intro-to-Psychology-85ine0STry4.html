telling me and the viewers at home a
little more about this event Lauren
that's a great question so at its core
what we have here is a weight difference
threshold competition and what that
means is well once I took these two mugs
they're identical they have the same way
so if I gave them to you right now what
would they feel like same right and what
if instead I put a gram of water into
one of these mugs and you're blindfolded
remember could you tell the difference I
don't think so with just one gram of
water but what if there was let's say
100 grams of water yeah I think I'd be
able to tell the difference between 100
grams of water you probably would so the
question is where is that threshold at
what point can you tell the difference
in weight how exactly are they going to
measure this though so what we're going
to be doing is making a lot of
comparisons we're going to have our 100
gram reference way and our athletes are
going to be comparing that to 101 grams
and then hundred and two grams and for
each of these comparisons they'll
identify or try to identify which is
heavier that's fascinating any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
