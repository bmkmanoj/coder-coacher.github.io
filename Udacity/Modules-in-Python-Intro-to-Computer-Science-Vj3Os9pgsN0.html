really applies to every programming
language in fact it applies to lots of
things beyond programming whether you're
designing a house designing a company
planning an event all of those things
benefit from doing things in a modular
way and thinking about how to break the
problem down into small pieces with
clean air faces now we're going to talk
about some of the specifics of how to
actually do this in Python and in Python
we can divide a program into modules
which are really just separate files in
order for one file to be able to use
another file once we've divided our
program into separate files in order to
use what's in one file in another file
we need to import it we can do this
using the syntax import followed by the
module name so if we're in the file a
pie and we want to use something from be
a pie we would just do import be Python
will look for a file name be dot pie
that's the simplest case and it will
find it in the current directory if it
doesn't find that file there there are
other ways it will look for a module and
it will look on a path of directories to
find it but the ones that you create
yourself will probably be in the same
directory as the file that you're
working on until your programs get
really complicated and then you'll
organize those into directories as well
we've used import before and you've seen
the import URL lib in some of the code
that we used in the search engine this
was used to be able to use a function to
get a page from the web we didn't define
this ourselves and if you look in the
directory there's no URL lib pie file
this is the module provided by the
Python library since we didn't define
this ourselves Python will search for
this on the path until it finds it we
can see what that path is by doing
import cysts to import the SIS module
and then looking at the value of path
defined in the cysts module and we see
this long path your results will vary
depending on how you install Python and
what platform you're working on the
specifics that you see here will depend
on your Python installation you should
see the first entry is the current path
there's an empty directory here meaning
it's always going to look in the current
directory first but then it's going to
look in a bunch of different library
directories to try to find the package
you're looking for the other thing I
want to point out here is the syntax I
used here this is the way that obtained
a definition from a module so we
imported this is module two acts
the definition from that module we need
to use the module followed by a dot and
then we can access the definitions in
that module what this means is that
modules avoid namespace pollution if we
didn't have to use the module to
reference definitions in the imported
files well then every time we imported a
file we'd have to worry about does it
use any names that we use and are we
going to lose our own definitions and
have pollution that way the way Python
avoids that is by when you import a
module all the names defined in that
file are only visible inside the module
followed by the module dot the name this
means if you had your own path variable
and then you import sis the value of
path hasn't changed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
