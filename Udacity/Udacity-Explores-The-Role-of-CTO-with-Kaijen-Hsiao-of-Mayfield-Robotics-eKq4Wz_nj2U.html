as a company has grown when we first
started and we were a company of only
seven people or so I was lead of all
things technical and in charge of kind
of the general architecture of the robot
so there's a lot of choosing what
processors do we use and what do we use
for the drivetrain and what do we use
for sensing for mapping and navigation
and what algorithms do we use and how do
we hide the camera and should we use a
camera should we use screen versus eyes
that sort of thing and also I was just
part of the software team writing actual
software for things like mapping and
navigation or just robot functions as a
team crew we hired a lot of more people
to write software and to build robots
and so I passed all that stuff off to
those people and then I was primarily
managing people for a while to build
robots and then finally we hired
managers to manage the people to
building robots and so I no longer had
to manage all the people so now I'm
actually back to writing code and I lead
a small team focused on mapping
navigation localization software and
that might sound odd is a very narrow
thing for a CTO to do but that's
actually a very typical CTO transition
from a small start-up to a large company
where over 50 people now so we have a
lot of people to build robots and do
things and another big part of my role
is to get out there and venture lies our
tech to the world and let everyone know
that curry is awesome and full of great
technology my proudest thing as CTO is
the choice that we made for the eyes in
designing that curry wasn't going to
have a screen curry was gonna have
actual physical eyes and I think it
makes curry look a lot more lifelike and
compelling this way and it also makes us
not just another tablet on wheels
there's a lot of parents who want to
limit screen time for their kids and to
say oh you can play with this tablet
that's fine but only for a little while
and another tablet on wheels maybe is
more of the same whereas curry is
definitely not in that category
curry is a pet a companion a friend for
me my favorite part is actually working
on the robots algorithms things like
mapping and navigation that I get
focused on these days which is a lot of
fun and the sensors involved in
designing the sensors and making sure
all that sort of thing works well I mean
I'm a robot assist at heart and that's
the really the most fun part for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
