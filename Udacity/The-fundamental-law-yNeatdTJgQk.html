and defined them we're now able to
describe the fundamental law as
expressed by Richard Reynold and it's
simple it's just this he was able to
show mathematically that information
ratio is equal to information
coefficient times the square root of
breath I'm gonna just present it without
proof here and encourage you to go look
at grin old's book if you're interested
for more detail so performance of the
manager or the fund is due to the skill
at making predictions times the
square-root of breath so that means for
instance that yes you may be very
skilled but you've got to have
opportunities to invest in order to
operationalize your skill now if you
want to improve your performance you can
either focus on improving your skill or
focus on improving your breath sometimes
it turns out that it's a lot easier to
increase breath by finding additional
stock so you might look at or additional
markets you might have some commodity
trading strategy that works great you
could increase your breath by looking at
additional commodities however the
strength of this increase in other words
as you increase breath the overall
performance only increases as the square
root of that breath so it tapers off
after some amount of time it turns out
though that it's very very hard to
improve your skill so that is why for
instance folks often focus on the breath
component of this equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
