and six times nine equals forty to
suggest that we need more control over
splitting strings because we might want
to split on things other than spaces
like hyphens or punctuation I'm gonna
introduce a tool that will help us do
just that a tool called regular
expressions suppose we want to find all
the numbers in a string we could make
ten different calls to string dot find
look for one look for a to look for
three we don't know what digits the
number begins with so we might have to
try all of these but that could get
really tedious really fast instead we're
going to use this new technique that I'm
just about to teach you regular
expressions the word regular has special
meaning in mathematics and computer
science theory but for now it just means
simple strings and expression is just a
concise notation you may have already
seen this in some math classes but not
thought about it in this manner if I
write a mathematical expression like X
is equal to the square root of four or
five is less than X is less than nine
each one of these admits or corresponds
to some possible values for X for
example if X is between five and nine
then it could be six or seven or eight
all of those are good all of those
satisfy this mathematical equation all
of these match this mathematical
equation similarly we often think of the
square root of four as being just two
but actually negative two works just as
well negative two times negative two is
four so these mathematical equations are
concise notations for possibly large set
of values especially if I do something
like this there are a large number of
possibilities 51:52 all the way up to
eighty nine and just writing this out
took much less room just as mathematical
expressions are very concise and let us
match or describe a large number of
integers or numbers regular expressions
are going to be very concise and let us
describe a large number of simple
strings so here is our first regular
expression bracket 1 - 3 close bracket
and this is associated with the 3
strings 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 formally we say that a
regular expression like this matches or
denotes all of these 3 strings and the
basic idea here is there's some symbol
on the left and some symbol on the right
and this regular expression matches each
one of those plus everything in between
so for example the regular expression 4
- 8 matches 4 5 6 7 8 and the regular
expression a through B matches the
string a in the string B perhaps
surprisingly regular expressions are
very popular and very useful online and
in computing in general credit cards
phone numbers addresses email addresses
these are all handled by regular
expressions on websites you've probably
already used under the hood let me show
you a compelling example here I have the
form from the US State Department for
applying for a US passport regular
expressions are very common when you
want to enter structured data or
structured strings for example over here
they require that your birthdate be
specified as two digits two more digits
and four more digits corresponding to
the month the day or the year by
contrast your place of birth is more
likely to include letters rather than
numbers the US social security number
involves three numbers two more numbers
and then four more numbers sometimes
separated by a hyphen or a blank an
email address has to have this special @
character in it regular expressions can
help us do that and then an American
phone number also has some number of
digits broken up into various groups a
billing address might have letters and
numbers and number science combined
arbitrarily regular expressions are
going to allow us to make sense of this
type of data and also process it when we
see it on webpages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
