ranking function so we said we're going
to have a time step we're going to keep
going through steps to get more accurate
rankings but initially we're going to
give every rank 1 divided by the number
of pages before I call that capital n
i'm going to use n pages as a more
pythonic variable name for that and we
updated the rank at time step T by
adding the probability that the random
surfer starts over and randomly picks
that page so that's one minus D is the
probability of starting over / n pages
how many pages there are and remember
that D is our damping constant and we'll
decide that D is pointing that's the
damping constant we add to that the sum
that we get of all the ranks all the
pages that link to this URL we add up d
times the previous iteration so it's
going to be d times rank on step t minus
one of that page but we want to divide
that by the number of out links from p
so it's starting to look more like
Python code we want to simplify it a
little bit before we get to Python code
and the first thing we're going to do is
simplify it is observe that well we have
this T parameter but we only ever use
the very previous one so we don't really
need to keep track of the rank value for
all the different T values we just need
to keep track of the previous one when
we did Fibonacci we kept track of
current and next in variables and that
allowed us to keep track of the previous
and the previous previous Fibonacci
numbers what we want to do with ranks is
something similar so we're going to use
the variable ranks to keep track of the
current ranks and as we compute the new
ranks we're going to use the variable
new ranks so we'll use ranks this
corresponds to the ranks at time t minus
one the ranks of the previous iteration
and we'll have a variable new ranks
which is the ranks at time t and the
reason we need both of those as we
update the rank from each page so we're
going to go through the pages
recomputing its rank we can't lose the
previous one we still need to get ranked
at the previous
step forth at page if we use the one
that we got this time that would distort
the results it would mean that the order
that we update the ranks for changes the
results so we don't want the results to
depend on the order that we go through
the pages that's why we need to keep
track of both the previous values which
will be used for ranks 2-1 and the new
ranks once we've done that we don't need
the T parameter anymore what we're going
to do is change this rank the rank at
time T is going to be the value of new
rank and the value of rank at time t
minus one that's the value of ranks the
other change I slipped into this before
we had / ends here and I've changed them
to square brackets and square brackets
should give you the idea that well this
might be a data structure that we're
indexing and that's correct we want to
index the data structure and we want to
index it by the URL that we're looking
for and the Python dictionary provides a
great way to do that at the end of this
will be a Python dictionary and that's
exactly what we want so I think we're
ready to start looking at the code we've
ridden this formula it's still a mix of
math and Python but we're going to turn
this into the code for computing the
page ranks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
