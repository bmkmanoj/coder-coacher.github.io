would be true but but this is the thing
that we're claiming and I want to at
least make it clear what we're claiming
the claim is that any value function at
any given step of value duration can be
represented finitely as just a maximum
over a bunch of linear functions each
linear function can handle an infinite
number of inputs right and that's not so
surprising if a linear functions can do
that but what's cool is we don't
actually have to represent the value for
each possible belief state B instead we
just throw all these linear functions
into a bag gamma sub T and then we want
to know the value for a given belief
state B we compute all the linear
function values and just take whichever
one is the highest at that point okay I
mean I guess that makes sense in the
abstract I guess the only thing that I
don't yet get is exactly where gamma
comes from yes that's what we have to
step through and that is not at all
obvious I think but it is very elegant
that it all works out and this was
originally shown by a fellow named
sondik and you know once you see it it's
maybe not so hard to see but I don't
know how he got here in the first place
it's it's it's to me it's not it's not
all readily apparent but once you see
thinks this way it gives you a very
powerful way to work with these infinite
sized state spaces you just have to take
operations on bags of vectors and so it
ends up all being finite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
