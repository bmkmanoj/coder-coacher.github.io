as the constructing the diagram is the
operations in the analysis model
operations comprise those actions that
the users can undertake to interact with
the text browser the call that we're
concerned here with an analysis model
and not a design okay so we are not
trying to fill in the implementation
methods that are involved but rather
we're using the class model diagram to I
described at a high level what the user
can do you can use the identified use
cases to answer the questions what
internally visible operations does the
text browser respond to and you recall
what those were so the first was just
viewing the text that doesn't seem to
really elicit any kind of behavior
though so that so you're right that
there's no event that the application
has to respond to to do that assuming
that we started it up okay okay and then
move in the handle okay so that's
certainly going to be an operation the
system has to respond to and lastly
resizing the people and we could also
specify parameters for those particular
operations like what's the size of the
viewport that the user would like to see
or what's the position of the handle in
the tray when when the user is using the
scroll bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
