lesson are for us to dive deeper into
the Harris corner detector algorithm we
have already looked at it briefly here
we're going to talk about the various
steps that go into making the Harris
corner detector algorithm and also look
at variety of differences and variants
on the basic algorithm help help us
understand how we can do feature
detection in addition I will also
describe the more widely used sift
algorithm which is actually pretty much
used on most software's that actually do
any kind of feature detection and
matching just to recall our goal is to
start off at two images and our interest
is to find features in these images like
these and then also find features and
another image in an image pair and then
match them saying this is the same
feature as that one so you know finding
the similar features across two images
is our goal and to do this we've been
spending a lot of time actually from the
earliest lectures trying to learn how we
can get inside and find repeatable
features that actually can be detected
more reliably across images even though
the images might be changed in this case
the change is subtle just a pan from one
view to the other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
