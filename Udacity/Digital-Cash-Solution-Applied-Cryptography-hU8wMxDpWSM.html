have universally recognized value
everyone can check that signature and
know it's an IOU from IP Bank it does
seem to be easy to transfer you can just
send the bits to another person it could
be anonymous and untraceable and let's
assume that it is this would be the case
if all the IOUs the bank creates are
exactly the same and the way we
described it seemed like they are it's
very light and portable so it looks like
we're doing really well we've got 4 out
of 5 we got a big problem though it's
not hard to copy it's in fact trivial to
copy we can send the same bits multiple
times and no one knows which ones are
valid which ones are copies so this
doesn't work and once we've lost this
property well we've all this one as well
it is hard to Forge to forge it we need
to know the private key of the bank but
that doesn't matter
because once we have one bill we can
make any number of copies of it and
spend them as many times as we want so
this means it actually doesn't have the
universally recognized value depending
on how you interpret this question this
is what I think is the correct answer
but there are other ways to interpret
this where your answer could be equally
valid and correct and not match mine so
one way to solve this would to give each
bill a unique ID and then if someone
attempts to double spend a bill the bank
would check has that bill been spent
already and if it's been spent already
the bank would alert the spender that
it's not a valid bill well this would
also cause problems for the second
possibility it would no longer be easy
to transfer if you have to check the ID
with the bank every time you get a bill
it would also no longer be anonymous it
would mean the bank can track all the
transactions because every time there's
the transaction the bank sees the unique
ID and knows who is transferring money
to whom there our goal is to have unique
IDs to prevent this copying problem but
preserve the anonymity and somewhat
preserve the easy to transfer we'll
still need the bank to check the ID when
the money is deposited but maybe there
could be transactions before that and we
can trace them back to who cheated at
the point where the cheating happened so
that's our goal the main tool that we
need for this is a new cryptographic
technique
called blind signatures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
