it's important to know a little bit
about the cultural background in order
to learn that I think you need to seek
out the people who are interested in
sharing it with you and I think that's
probably the most important part is to
be culturally aware and respectful of
what people are willing to share with
you so for example I was not cultural
culturally sensitive when I was thinking
about my thesis topic I wanted to bridge
the gap between my undergrad thesis on
native language and its effect on my
identity and tech since I'm currently in
computer science I wanted to bridge that
gap and where I was I wouldn't say
disrespectful just not going about it
the right way you know usually you're
invited by somebody you're invited to
somebody's home and it's about just
being in that space with that person and
whatever they're comfortable sharing
with you like an elder the person who I
was wanting to speak with was an elder
and I spoke with his son and he's like
you can't go in there and just ask
questions and expect them to be answered
and that's exactly what I was intending
to do and after talking to him a little
bit more I understood and everything all
the knowledge that I wanted to gain from
that conversation was not going about it
in a culturally sensitive way and that's
me within the tribe another tribal
person you know there are I want to say
regulations you know what can you do and
what can't you do and what I was doing
was was not appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
