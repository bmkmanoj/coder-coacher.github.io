distributed systems with definitions and
principles we then saw how object
technology with its innate concepts of
inheritance and reuse helps in
structuring distributed services at
different levels in this next lesson
module we will discuss the design and
implementation of some select
distributed system services
technological innovation come when one
looks beyond the obvious and immediate
horizon often this happens in academia
because a key dimensions are not bound
by market pressures or compliance to
existing product lines you'll see this
out-of-the-box thinking in the three
subsystems that we are going to discuss
as part of this lesson module another
important point often the byproducts of
a thought experiment may have more
lasting impact than the original vision
behind the thought experiment
history is ripe with many examples we
will not have the ubiquitous yellow
sticky note but for space exploration
now close to home for this course Java
would not have happened but for the
failed video on demand trials of the 90s
in this sense the services we are going
to discuss as part of this lesson module
while interesting in their own right may
themselves be not as important as the
technological insights they offer on how
to construct complex distributed
services such technological insights are
the reusable products of most thought
experiments there is a common theme in
the three distributed subsystems we're
going to discuss memory is a critical
precious resource with advances in
network technology leveraging the idle
memory of a peer in a local area network
may help overcome shortage of memory
locally available in a particular node
the question is how best to use the
cluster memory that is the physical
memory of peers tend to be idle at any
particular point of time in a local area
network the global memory system GMS
asks the question how can we use the
peer memory for paging across the local
area network and later on we will see
DSM which stands for distributed shared
memory asks a question if shared memory
makes a life of application programmers
simple in a multiprocessor can we try to
provide the same abstraction in a
cluster and make the cluster appear like
a shared memory machine and the third
work that we will see is distributed
file system in which we ask the question
can we use the cluster memory for
cooperative caching of files anyhow back
to our first part of this three-part
lesson module namely the global memory
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
