ask are how big can this be how much of
it can we get what's the growth rate of
the market is the market itself
declining or is it in flux or is it
going to start taking off and most
importantly here is talk to customers in
the sales channel and next important is
you can get some pretty good market size
estimates by competitive approximation
if it's an existing or resegmented
market or even if you're going to clone
a market outside the US next important
is wall street Nana's forts are great
market research firms like Forrester and
Gartner are great but something to keep
in mind about market research forecast
going forward market research data is
wonderful on the size of markets in the
past but if market researchers were
great at predicting the future they
naturally be running hedge funds so one
of the things I don't accept from my
students is and it's going to be a 40
billion dollar business in the next
seven years what's its size now zero so
therefore I just don't accept it guesses
from a market research firm unless
you've actually cross validated that
with some really heavy customer input
from outside the building</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
