it was just how many people have the
robot dream of I really want a robot my
own r2d2 version etc and I thought that
was kind of limited to you know geeks
and engineers or something and it turns
out that's pretty widespread there's a
lot of people out there who really have
that dream other random things that we
found through testing that was really
surprising to me are things like a lot
of people don't understand
top-down maps so as a roboticist we're
used to seeing
for instance navigation maps from the
robot and even specifying where you want
the robot to go by saying in the map I
would like you to go over here and when
we first started when the very first
test we did was with a functional
prototype that looked nothing like hurry
and just with an app and we had an
interface where you could tell the robot
to go various places using a top-down
map and most people could not understand
the map and could not understand where
the robot was and where they were
telling him to go and not even just
we're used to laser maps being somewhat
difficult because you know it's only
black and white
it's from the level of the laser it's a
2d map doesn't necessarily resemble what
you think of as a floor plan for your
home like you might see like on the wall
the emergency floor plan this is where
the exit is etc but even the emergency
exit plans a lot of people can't
understand those and we actually took
top-down color maps of the room which
curry could not ever actually get
because curry can't see above table
height for instance but we took scanners
that were able to scan the room from a
much higher height and could make
full-color renders of this is what your
entire room looks like from the top down
and can people even use that interface
and the answer was no most people can't
and so we had to upend the idea of
specifying navigation waypoints by
top-down map entirely so that users who
can't understand them can still use the
robot so we moved instead towards you
drive the robots to a place and you see
what the robot is seeing through his
camera and you can save that point as a
location in your house and both has a
name and as a picture and that's very
intuitive people if you just click on
that then you know where you're sending
the robot and he will go back to where
you put him in the first place
another very surprising thing to me in
terms of user interfaces was joy
sticking a lot of people can't actually
joystick the robot with a basic joystick
and
that you press forward and the robot
moves forward when they're looking at
the robot and they press forward the
robot they think it's forward from their
point of view they don't necessarily
understand a transformation of forward
from the robots point of view and some
people never get that even after a lot
of practice and so we're still working
now on exactly what best interfaces
would give people to allow them to move
around but some things that we've tried
that people seem to enjoy our things
like you can click in the image to make
the robot drive there and that's
intuitive to go so you're looking at
image and you know where you're clicking
on in the image you know where the
robots going to go that's much more
intuitive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
