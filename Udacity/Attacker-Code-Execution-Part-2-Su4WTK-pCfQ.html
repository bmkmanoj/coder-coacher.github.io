does what input it takes how does it
execute under different values for the
input that we provide it but to really
understand how we actually take this
buffer overflow to its logical
conclusion which is actually getting
control of this program we need to
actually look carefully at how data is
stored on the stack what is the layout
of the stack so remember I told you that
stack grows from high addresses to low
addresses so we are at some address and
as we put more stuff on it we are going
to lower addresses so as we go down the
stack as we push things on to the stack
we get to lower and lower addresses and
that's what I meant by the stack growing
from high addresses to low addresses or
growing up you think of your address
space starting at 0 and going to the max
then the stack growth is from higher to
lower addresses and lower addresses are
higher or up so that's why we're saying
it grows in that direction so when you
make the function call we're going to
push the arguments arc CR with the
argument so we are assuming this is what
the compiler does you make a function
call in your programming language the
first thing it does it is going to push
so whatever stack pointer is pointing we
push this argument that X 4 bytes so the
next the place it points to is address
where the stack pointer is pointing is
address -4 addr minus 4 then we pushed
argue E and at this point we have to
push the return address remember we have
to know where the return address is so
when we finish executing this function
we can go back to where we came from in
the end push the return address so the
compiler generates code to push the
arguments and then you make a function
call or you make a call and typically
the hardware pushes the return address
on the stack wherever the stack pointer
is pointing that goes here and then we
get to the the stack pointer is pointing
to we decrement the stack pointer by 4
because return address let's at X 4
bytes so now we're going to allocate
space for the local variables allow
login 2x 4 bytes 12 byte strings take 12
bytes that we have here so each
password string and target password we
have 12 bytes each so if you look at you
made the call if the stack pointer was
pointing to addr then I can say well the
address of allow login is a DDR minus 12
because for for argh C for for are we
for for return address already occupied
this 12 location so the stack pointer
has to move beyond those and it does
that by moving 12 bytes up and as it
goes up to lower addresses we're doing
this subtraction that I said so now if
you look at here the couple of
interesting things if this is password
string isn't it it's allocated space
starting here if it's less than 12 bytes
that the input we provide it's going to
stay within these 12 bytes that we
allocated for it
so this is the starting address so if
your variable is that address address
plus 1 plus 2 it it goes like that every
byte you store so these are the higher
addresses we're talking about
so password string start here if it's
less than 12 bytes it's only going to go
into these 12 bytes what happens if it's
longer than 12 bytes some of the
examples that we did when we set it with
16 or something like that it's going to
exhaust these 12 bytes it's going to
override the allow login and if it's
more than 16 what is it going to do it's
going to overwrite the return address so
the way these things are laid out on the
stack remember our password string
variable address starts here and as we
provide some number of characters it
starts storing them if they're less than
12 we're good
if the more than 12 we first going to
overwrite allow login then we're gonna
overwrite return address then we're
going to corrupt the argument values and
things like that
now you can say well what if I give more
than 12 bytes we earlier said 16 or
ending whatever it is we know that if
it's more than 12 it's going to overflow
into this this is what is going to
overflow as</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
