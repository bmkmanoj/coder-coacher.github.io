everything so here's a quiz
so here are two matrices matrix
prisoner's dilemma and matrix a bunch of
numbers that look vaguely symmetric but
aren't quite so here's what I'm gonna
ask you to do in each of these cases
find the Nash equilibrium so do you told
me what it was but you didn't tell me
how to find them so that seems kind of
rude it was implicit it's intuitively
obvious even to the most casual observer
oh well then okay so and just to remind
me now each row and column is a choice
for one of the players or the other
player yeah and the first number in the
pair is the row player or A's payoff and
the second number is B's payoff yes and
we might need probability distributions
or we might not depending on what it
takes to be a Nash equilibrium right
okay I don't I'm not it's not like I see
the answer yet but but I either will be
able to find it or I won't at least I
understand the question
okay and by the way just to make it
easier for you there are pure Nash
equilibria here okay mm all right so you
ready yep just circle the one or
underline it or whatever it is push car
does to make it so that you can answer
this quiz you ready totally go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
