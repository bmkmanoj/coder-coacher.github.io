we're looking for is the x-coordinate of
the proper line at the point where the y
coordinate is equal to 400 so we're
looking for where each of these lines
intersects the line y equals 404 line
number one this happens right here at 30
gallons brand to and brand three
actually both intersect our lovely green
line at the same point so all three of
these lines the orange light blue and
the green meet at whatever this point is
we know that the y coordinate is 400 and
the x coordinate is if we look down at
the x axis 25 taking into account how
many gallons of solution each of these
three brands can give us or four hundred
dollars it looks like now brand one is
actually the best deal so it turns out
that it's a bit trickier to choose which
brand is the best to go with thank
orient might have thought earlier as you
can see from our graph the brand that's
going to help him use his money most
efficiently is going to be different
depending on how much money he wants to
spend no matter how much money grants
decides to spend on cleaning solution
this graph is definitely going to come
in handy to help him make the best
choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
