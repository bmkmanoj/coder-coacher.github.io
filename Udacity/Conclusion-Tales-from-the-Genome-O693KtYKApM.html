there that primarily focus on genetics
every day but there's a growing number
of careers they use genetic information
more and more all the time now this
class is just a taste of all the genetic
stories that are out there so if you
ever hear another story or you want a
quick review of genetic information for
another genomics class then come back
and see us now we want to direct your
attention to two important appendices to
the course the first appendix actually
has a full linked interview for everyone
who is interviewed in the course the
second appendix actually will show you
how to extract DNA in the comfort of
your own kitchen using nothing more than
household items now it's time for us to
wrap things up and we really want to
thank you for participating because
without you we wouldn't be here and we
also want to thank our production team
here Udacity particularly Taylor and
grant and we'd also like to thank our
collaborators at 23andme especially
esther kim jeff pollard join a mountain
and uh DeFranco and thank you to
everyone who allowed us to interview
them about their life stories now we
love getting feedback from you good or
bad so stay in touch go to the forums
email us and let us know if this class
has helped you out in some way now in
the meantime go and press your friends
with your newfound genetic knowledge and
congratulations on completing tales from
the genome well then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
