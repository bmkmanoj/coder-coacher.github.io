the group are if we look back at our
directory listing will see two columns
here in the middle most of the entries
read student student but there's one
here that reads root root and I'll come
back to that one these two columns
identify the owner and the group for
each entry in this list now it's
important to remember although each of
these has the same word student listed
in the two columns they are in two
entirely different things the system has
a user name student which is the owner
of the file and a group name student
which was automatically created when we
made this user this is a pre common
practice on a Linux system to have a
group name the same as a user just
remember that they are two entirely
different things so what's up with this
entry here that has root root we can see
the dangers name is dot dot and that's
just a shortcut for the parent directory
and we know we're in our students home
directory so this entry here is the
equivalent of slash home that directory
is owned by the root user and has a
group of root and if we look at the
permissions we see that only the root
user can write to that directory let's
test this out for ourselves I'll move
into that directory using CDI and then
I'll try and write a file you'll get a
permission denied error just as this
permission system told us we would only
route is allowed to write in this
directory and our current users
definitely not root we can still list
the files in this directory because we
have read access and we even entered the
directory because we have execute we
just can't write</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
