in general stochastic mbps and so we're
going to need to combine the two ideas
that we've been talking about wait what
were the two ideas we were talking about
well in the context of bandits we talked
about stochastic processes and the trick
that we used was to use something like a
huff ting bound we just keep repeating
the stochastic thing until we have
enough data so we can make accurate
estimates okay and then we talked about
sequential domains that are
deterministic and the kind of the main
trick that we use there was this rmax
trick that said if there's a state
action pair that we don't know about
assume that's really really good hmm ok
we can put these two ideas together and
get a stochastic version of our max ok
so we'll have hufton regions yes good
good good we're still going to use
huffing bounds on the individual state
action pairs ok in fact regions probably
means state action pairs here so I was
right yes you were right good well then
I think we're done here all right so
let's write down what this algorithm
looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
