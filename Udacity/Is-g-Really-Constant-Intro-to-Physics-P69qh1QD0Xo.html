acceleration due to gravity up till now
we've been saying that this acceleration
is just 10 meters per second squared
anywhere on the earth we've been
assuming it didn't matter if you were
here or here or here or there little G
was equal to 10 meters per second
squared now one thing I have to confess
is that it's actually closer to 9.81
meters per second squared but that's
something we're not going to worry about
what I really want to get in this
problem is the underlying cause of this
acceleration and examine any sort of
differences in this acceleration due to
well let's see we know this
gravitational acceleration is due to a
gravitational force which we can call FG
and we've talked about how that force is
proportional to 1 over R squared now
when we stand on the earth the are that
we're talking about is actually the
distance between the center of the earth
and the center of our bodies and the
distance is about 6,400 kilometers
that's the radius of the earth now since
the force of gravity has this strange
dependence 1 over R squared and remember
this means if I get twice as far away
from the earth so maybe if I were out
over here somewhere the force of gravity
would be one-quarter is strong because
one quarter is one-half squared now we
know that there's this strange
dependence on the force of gravity it
goes like 1 over R squared so that means
if I get twice as far away the force
gets actually four times weaker now
remember it's this force of gravity
which is causing this acceleration due
to gravity and since force is
proportional to acceleration well that
means that acceleration like gravity is
proportional to 1 over R squared by what
percentage does the acceleration due to
gravity change when we stand on Mount
Everest now Mount Everest would be
somewhere over here and the height of
Mount Everest is about equal to 9
kilometers this is a tricky question but
try to think back about what you know
about proportionality to give us an
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
