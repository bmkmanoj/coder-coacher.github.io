Chris should be wearing the same size
t-shirt is Sarah rather than Cameron is
that I compared these numbers that I
computed for each of these people and I
said is Chris closer to Cameron's number
or to Sarah's number and as it turns out
he's about 26 away from Sarah and he's
about 35 away from Cameron it's closer
to Sarah now what went wrong here is
that this metric of height plus weight
has two very imbalanced features in it
height and weight so here's what I mean
by that the height is gonna be a number
that generally goes between let's say
the numbers of five and seven the weight
on the other hand takes on much larger
values between 115 and 175 pounds in
this example so what ends up happening
when you compute the sum of the two of
them is that the weight almost always
will completely dominate the answer that
you get and height ends up being
effectively a rounding error whereas
what you probably want is something
where the two features are equally
weighted in in the sum when you add them
together and this is what feature
scaling does it's a method for rescaling
features like these ones so that they
always span comparable ranges usually
between zero and one so then the numbers
that you get from height will be between
zero and one they'll still contain the
same information but just expressed in
different units and the weight will also
be expressed between zero and one again
you'll still have the information there
that Cameron raised the most and Sara
weighs the least but it'll be expressed
over this much smaller range then when
you add them together weight won't
completely dominate the equation anymore
and when that happens you should get a
much more sensible result for Chris's
t-shirt size because even though he's a
little bit closer to Sarah in weight
he's much closer to Cameron in height
and so he'll probably end up getting
grouped with Cameron in the next video
I'll show you the equation for feature
scaling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
