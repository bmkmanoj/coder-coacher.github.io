container having the following
properties and these properties will
make it just perfect for holding a
frontier in our parallel BFS first a bag
will be unordered and will allow
repetition remember that a BFS has to
maintain a frontier so it enable as much
parallelism as possible we should allow
redundant insertions of the same vertex
if need be so here for example you can
see this bag has three copies of the
element C and that's okay why because
even if we process see at the same time
by say different threads they should all
get assigned the same level now the
second thing a bag will allow is fast
enumeration of its elements remember the
BFS has to traverse all the vertices in
a frontier so being able to do so
quickly will be extremely helpful now
also remember that our best
parallelization technique so far has
been divide and conquer so one really
special operation on a bag is the idea
of splitting it into two roughly equal
pieces and of course the inverse
operation should also be fast and that's
union now union will also be special in
that it will be logically associative so
what does that mean suppose I call this
a and I call this be logical
associativity means that a union B is
exactly the same as B Union a at least
logically even if that's not physically
how we store things now logical
associativity will also give us the
property or the ability to apply reducer
hyper objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
