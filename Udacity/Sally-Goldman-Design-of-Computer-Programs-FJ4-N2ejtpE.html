here today with Sally Goldman Sally's a
professor at washington university is
also a researcher at Google we'd like to
talk mostly about the process of
choosing the right algorithm and data
structure and how your programs are so
much tied to that choice the big picture
I think in terms will be focused on the
book is if I'm looking at a data
structure for a problem there's broad
classes of data structures some data
structures are very good just searching
something with a unique ID other things
may be good at finding like I want to
find if the word CA T is that substrate
is part of a word and so this is broad
class of a data structure so really the
encapsulations is important is to
understand these abstract data types or
a DTS and understand which one of those
fits your problem because that's the
fundamental decision and there's less of
them so it's easier so for so I'm
variant is something typically about
your data that holds all the time so if
I have something called search tree I
may say that if I'm at a certain note
everything on the left half is smaller
and everything on the right half is
bigger again I think it helps just in
understanding and designing the data
structure to remember this is an
important thing and I need to make sure
that all the methods and all the
operations I do preserve this and in
that particular case it allows me to
search quickly and without that
invariant that lose it but at the same
time it lets you formally prove
correctness so you can actually it's
pretty good duel I think it has helps
you reason about it informally and lets
you formally in fact prove that you
haven't forgotten any cases so how do
you know you have the right answer
certainly it's good to prove you're
always going to have the right answer
but that proof is about the the
technique that you created it doesn't
see that your code is right so I think
you actually want to prove or rather
informally at least that you're going to
always have the right answer but you
need test without unit test bugs will
creep in the book we wrote we have a
couple thousand unit tests and I'll tell
you there's times in the end I'm like oh
I can make this a little simpler I
didn't need this case and all the unit
tests start going red
and then I put a sentence about why you
needed it so I think you actually need
testing in the code to make sure the
code actually really implemented what
you intend it and testing at the
algorithmic level um yeah so looking at
the difference in dealing with sort of
algorithmic complexity making sure you
actually cover all the cases of the
input and dealing with sort of
complexity of the code different
operating systems different windows yeah
it's tricky and also everyone wants to
try out different things and so you have
all these little different variations
and the code gets a lot of cruft built
into it that kind of can get it out of
hand and so I think of industry code
it's also important to kind of keep that
in check what makes for good code clean
it should be fairly module or you don't
want the two page method you definitely
want to make sure that commonly used
blocks are reused and yes some
documentation and the methods whether in
a separate file like if it's a c plus
plus with an H file or something where
it's all together you definitely want to
really say what the method is doing in
the end good code is code that other
people can come and change and adapt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
