them useful however a tree is really
just an extension of a linked list a
linked list has one element at the front
and a next pointer to another element
and so on a tree is similar the first
element is called the root instead of
having just one next element a tree can
have several a linked list is often
drawn horizontally but a tree is
normally drawn vertically like this
just like a linked list each element on
a tree contains some data the individual
elements in a tree that contain values
are often called nodes let's add a few
more constraints on what we call a tree
first of all a tree must be completely
connected that means if you're starting
from the root there must be some way to
reach every node in the tree here is an
example of unconnected nodes so this
definitely isn't a tree next there must
not be any cycles in the tree a cycle
occurs when there's a way for you to
encounter the same node twice for
example in this tree there's a
connection back to the root if I start
at the root then I'll get back to the
root the same goes for this tree if you
ignore the arrows you can still go in a
circle this counts as a cycle so beware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
