modern routers was to place a copy of
the forwarding table on each line card
in the router while this introduces some
complications in making copies of the
forwarding table doing so prevents a
central table on the router from
becoming a bottleneck at high speeds
considered an alternative where the
router has only one copy of the
forwarding table in that case all of the
line cards would need to be performing
lookups on a central table which
involves communication across the
backplane as well as many more lookups
against a central table so while
distributing the forwarding table across
line cards prevents a central table from
becoming a bottleneck early router
architectures did not place the lookup
table on each line card and as a result
when packets arrived at an individual
line card they would induce a lookup in
a shared buffer memory which could be
accessed over a shared bus but this
shared bus of course introduces a
bottleneck as well as contention between
the different line cards that may be all
performing lookups to the same shared
memory the solution of course was thus
to remove the shared memory and instead
place copies of the forwarding table on
each line card in summary an important
innovation in the design of these
routers was to eliminate the shared bus
and place the look-up tables on
individual line cards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
