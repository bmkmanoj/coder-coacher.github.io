of which runs on the GPU one of which
runs on the CPU so we're going to start
by saying what do we have to express in
the GPU part of this program and we only
need to express something very simple
the idea that out equals n times n now
this kernel that we write for the GPU
doesn't say anything about the level of
parallelism if you remember kernels look
like cereal programs so the idea of the
fact we're going to do this sixty-four
times not expressed in the GPU program
at all what does the CPU do well it has
to do the allocation of the memory
copying the data to and from the GPU but
the important part in terms of the
computation is that the CPU launches the
kernel this is where the parallelism of
threads is expressed the CPU program
will look something like ok let's launch
a square kernel we're going to watch 64
threads and the arguments to those
threads are an output array and an input
array just to get our terminology
straight what we're doing here is
launching a kernel called square kernel
on 64 threads and each of those 64
instances of the kernel will perform one
of the 64 square operations that we need
to do now one question that may be
puzzling you is what good is it to
launch 64 instances of the exact same
program so here's how we answer that
question each thread that we launch
knows which thread it is we're going to
call that the thread index so if you
launch 64 threads one of them knows it's
thread zero one of them knows it's
thread one and so on then you can assign
thread number n to work on the nth
element of the array so let's summarize
here you write your kernel so that it
will run on one thread at a time then
you will launch many threads each of
which will run that kernel independently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
