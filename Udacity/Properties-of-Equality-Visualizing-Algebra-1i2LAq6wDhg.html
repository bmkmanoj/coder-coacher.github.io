approaching this problem we can think
about combining the like terms are the
like weights on one side I can combine
the m's as like terms so i'll have 3m on
this side and 2m on this side i can also
combine the two hundred and the 50 these
are both like terms and Sturgis numbers
238 are also like terms i can add those
weights together so i have two hundred
thirty eight plus 3 m is equal to 2 50
plus 2m i have 238 plus 3 m is equal to
250 plus 2m we know we can remove
weights from both sides so we can take
off a 2m from here and here i remove to
em from the weights and 2m from the
weights over here so I'm just left with
238 plus M equals 250 I want to think
about getting em alone I want to isolate
this variable I want to figure out how
much this weighs so I should remove 238
pounds from both sides we could easily
think about me removing 200 and 200 and
then removing 38 and reviewing 38 from
50 so we know one way m is equal to 12
pounds when looking back at our work we
should always remember that we're trying
to isolate em you want to remove the
variable from both sides and remove
constants from both sides eventually we
want the variable on one side and
constants on the other we could have
done this in a reverse order and maybe
you did it a little bit differently
that's okay we just want to make sure
we're performing the same steps and
reasoning through our results when
solving the equation we always want to
start off by combining like terms this
helps us know what to remove from both
sides of the equation we could have
removed the numbers from both sides of
the equation first that's okay we just
need to be consistent and always remove
or perform the same operation on both
sides of the equation at each step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
