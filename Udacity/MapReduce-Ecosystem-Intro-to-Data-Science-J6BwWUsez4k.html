MapReduce programming model a very
common open source implementation of the
MapReduce programming model is Hadoop
Hadoop couples the MapReduce programming
model with a distributed file system in
order to more easily allow programmers
to complete complicated tasks using the
processing power of Hadoop there are
many infrastructures out there that are
either built on top of Hadoop or allow
data access via Hadoop two of the most
common are hive and pig hive was
initially developed by Facebook and one
of its biggest selling points is that it
allows you to run MapReduce jobs through
a sequel like querying language called
the hive query language Pig was
originally developed at Yahoo and excels
in some areas hive does not pick jobs
are written in a procedural language
called Pig Latin this wins you a bunch
of things among them are the ability to
be more explicit about the execution of
your data processing which is not
possible in a declarative language like
sequel syntax and also the ability to
split your data pipeline hive and pig
are two of the most common Hadoop based
products but there are a bunch of them
out there for example mahute for machine
learning giraffe for graph analysis and
Cassandra a hybrid of a key value in a
column-oriented database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
