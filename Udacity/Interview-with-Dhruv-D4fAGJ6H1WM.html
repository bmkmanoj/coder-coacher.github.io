us today and he's a product engineer at
Udacity sewed roof tell us the story
about how you learned your first
framework the first framework I use was
in college of Ruby on Rails and people
will usually teach you frameworks as a
starting point into building your first
application because it takes away a lot
of the decisions and complexities for
you so you can just jump into a
framework learn it and ideally get
building your first application in a
couple days so that was the first
general framework i used the first
front-end specific framework i use was
angular i used it in a summer internship
in my senior year and again it was like
at the moment at the time I thought it
was like nothing I'd ever seen but it
helped me get moving quickly into
routing building views and generally
getting the fundamental design patterns
of the web quickly so now that you're
working with one framework how how
difficult was it to switch to a new
framework the truth is a lot of these
frameworks come from radically different
paradigms so angular and react are
almost have very different philosophies
about things but a lot of them do share
commonalities so for instance if you go
between angular and ember both are
generally MVC frameworks and if you know
one you get the guiding principles are
the ideas behind the others a framework
like react comes at it from a very
different way but knowing another
framework helps you evaluate another
framework you're using so knowing
angular help me understand a lot more
about why react is useful what were the
guiding philosophies I made it unique
and appealing to developers and
understanding the trade-offs that came
with it compared to a system like
angular or amber amber okay so if you
are learning frameworks you shouldn't
just find your first one and stick with
that for life you should experience the
other ones build something with them see
what are the needs of your application
and then pick the best framework for
that definitely I think that's a that's
a very good answer there's some
frameworks that are fairly impractical
but I learned them anyways because they
again teaching philosophies and ideas of
approaching programming that are unique
so in particular I checked out Elm lang
it is a very functional approach to
doing front-end programming
the closure script a lot again another
very functional perspective to doing
programming and these have all affected
how I view the frameworks I use today
and in addition to just looking at what
works for you at this given point of
time it's also worth looking at what the
general community is working towards
because if you work with the community
you're going to get a lot of tools a lot
of resources that you wouldn't get
otherwise we choose a very nice
framework so there's a lot of
considerations to make but understanding
that not all frameworks are perfect and
that every framework might not be
perfect for the job you juicing it's a
very good place to start so what is some
advice that you would give to students
that are looking to dive into the world
of frameworks to start by not looking at
the fine-grained details of how to
implement X Y or Z in a framework
although you'll have to do that in your
app but at some point to take a step
back and try and figure out what's the
philosophy of this framework a framework
is essentially some really smart people
somewhere have designed this intricate
system to help you accomplish something
there's a lot to learn and just looking
at how it was designed and you can reuse
a lot of those concepts and future
things you've built so the first thing
is just looking at the framework
understanding it and understanding how
it was created what the decisions will I
mean frameworks are always going to be
good at something that bad as some
things understanding those trade-offs
and learning to appreciate those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
