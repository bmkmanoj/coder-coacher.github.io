for the analysis in this lesson and we
build daily returns like we've seen
before by starting with a price time
series in each point and this daily
return chart is related to how much
price has changed on that corresponding
day so for instance this represents how
much the price changed from this day to
that day about one percent and of course
we have that for each of the days in our
history now looking at this data this
daily return data it's not too revealing
it's hard to draw many sorts of
interesting conclusions just by visually
looking at this data from day to day and
so there's a number of interesting ways
that we can look at that data and that's
that's what this lesson is all about
those two ways are histograms and
scatter plots let's start by taking a
look at histograms a histogram is a kind
of bar chart where we plot the number of
occurrences of each item versus the
value so the way we accomplish that is
we split up the range of data into lots
of little bins and we count up how many
times the data matches the range across
that bin so as an example if you notice
here we've got several occurrences of
this value which is about the same and
those three occurrences are probably and
say this bin so when we go to plot the
histogram overall we would see a bar of
the appropriate height here that
represents how many values how many
times the data match that value and of
course we have values and other bins and
so the bars and those bins would have
various heights and as you gather that
data across all of time a shape emerges
of this histogram and that provides a
lot of information so let's consider
what that shape might look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
