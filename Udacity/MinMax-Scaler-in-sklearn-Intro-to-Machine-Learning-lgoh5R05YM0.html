to do the min/max scaler example that we
just did by hand but now in SK learn so
the min/max scaler as always is
something that I first find out about by
visiting the SK learn documentation
using Google so when I google for an
example I get something like this and I
click on the first link there's a number
of different functions that Python has
available to you for pre-processing data
we'll be looking at the min/max scaler
today and that falls under this
paragraph of scaling features to a range
this is the documentation page that I
had open when I came up with the example
that I'm going to show you right now so
in order to make it maximally easy to
follow I would suggest that you sort of
have this open in a parallel tab in your
browser but I'll also be explaining each
step as I go through it to show you how
to use this in a practical example I
come over to my terminal window and I
fire up the Python interpreter and the
first thing that I'm going to need to do
is import the module the next thing that
I actually need to do this is one of the
things that was tricky for me the first
time around is import numpy because as
you might have sort of noticed by now a
lot of the SK learn functions require
numpy inputs so let me show you what I
mean I'm going to be using weights data
in this example so I'm going to create a
feature called weights and as it happens
I'm going to make this into a numpy
array I just got this from the example
on the SK learn documentation page that
I showed you this is kind of me
following the steps that they laid out
what I do now is I make my input data so
in this case I'll be using the weights
example and something that's a little
bit tricky that I had to play around
with to figure out is that what you
actually want is a numpy array each
element of the numpy array is going to
be a different training point and then
each element within that training point
is going to be a feature so in this case
I'm really only interested in one
feature the weights feature and then I
have three different training points for
my three different people so when I put
in my data it looks like this now that I
have my weights data input I'm ready to
use the scaler on that here's the scaler
that I imported from SK learning and I
want to have a new feature this name is
rescaled let's call it rescaled weight
and to make rescaled weight what I do is
I call fit transform on the weights so
this actually does two things the first
thing that it does is it fits so it does
things like find them x-men and the X
Max and then the transform actually
applies the formula to all the elements
in the in the set of data
so this is doing two things at the same
time sometimes you'll only want to do
one or the other now I've actually set
myself up to make a mistake here let me
show you what happens all right so we
got an error here that says it's going
it's assuming floating-point values as
input but instead it got integers and
the reason why has to do with this line
right here all of these inputs are
integers but it's expecting
floating-point numbers and if you were
looking at the documentation the example
very closely as I was doing this you
might have figured out that this was
going to be a problem down the road for
us so I'm going to turn these into
floating-point numbers by putting a
decimal point after each one of them and
we'll try this again great that looks
much better let me print it out now and
there's our new transformed feature so
there's the point four one seven that we
calculated in the last example you can
also see that the smallest value in the
list has a rescale value of zero and the
largest one has a rescaled value of one
which if you look at the equation
carefully will immediately become
apparent that that's always going to be
true so this is an example of how you
can use the min/max scaler in SK learn
to do in just a couple lines what we did
by hand in the last example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
