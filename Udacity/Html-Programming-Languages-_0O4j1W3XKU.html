language many of you may have some
previous experience with HTML but that's
not necessary HTML is we know it was
invented by Tim berners-lee a british
computer scientist working in
switzerland around nineteen ninety for
our purposes HTML just tells a web
browser how to display a web page in
fact HTML is not all that different from
using symbols like stars or underscores
to emphasize text that you're writing to
someone else in HTML this emphasised
plain text becomes I and then this
special punctuation that means let's do
some bold now really this special
punctuation that means I am done with
bold let's go back to normal and then
like you the B stands for bold let's go
see how that pans out here in this
particular window i'm showing the raw
HTML source on the left and how it might
look in a web browser on the right here
when i've added the bold tags around
really we see i really like you there
really is rendered in bold other comet
approaches an HTML for emphasis or the
use of underlines the you and italics I
and each one of these is called a tag
this special syntax with the be in angle
brackets be sort of in similar angle
brackets the you the closing you the I
the closing I is a tag that's associated
with that word or that span of text and
tells the web browser how to render it
in this part here the left angle bracket
in the right angle bracket that's a
starting tag and this other part the
left angle bracket followed by a / the /
is super important beginning end tag
it's a little complicated to say mark
the start of an ending tag tell you that
the current tag is about to stop so
here's a beginning bold tag here's an
ending bold tag and you can see that
play out on the right only the word
really is bolded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
