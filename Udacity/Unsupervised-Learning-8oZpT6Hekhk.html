supervised learning which was a way of
teaching assistant to understand some
concept based on some labeled incoming
data but what about if the data wasn't
labeled so we used the example of
teaching a system to recognize my face
but that involved having a bunch of
pictures that a person had already gone
through and said these are pictures of
David and these are pictures of other
people what if we didn't have that what
if we wanted to just teach the system to
understand similar faces without going
through and actually coding which ones
were the same person in advance
that's where unsupervised learning comes
in unsupervised learning is helping a
system learn in concept based on
unlabeled data so it just learns the
ideas just based on the data that's
already there this is very useful in
other domains as well and healthcare for
example supervised learning can be used
to help a system identify which patients
are at risk for certain disease early if
we already know what the disease is
but unsupervised learning could actually
help us uncover diseases that we didn't
even know existed based on patterns of
common symptoms so an unsupervised
learning we're really going to learn
about how systems can learn new and
interesting things based on unlabeled
incoming data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
