across one or more of these examples
using randomness is of course quite
important in computer science you might
have come across randomness for example
in cryptography where randomness is in a
way the only way to fully securely
encode a message you might have
encountered randomness in something
called symmetry breaking let's say you
walk down a hallway and somebody comes
in your direction and you're trying to
get out of the way of that person but
the moment that you get out of the way
that person also tries to get out of the
way in the same direction and so if you
did not have random decisions then then
you would almost certainly crash into
each other and finally randomness is
often used in simulations so when you do
physics simulation or financial
scenarios then of course also randomness
is something very very useful now the
difficulty with using randomness to
solve NP complete problems is this in
all of these examples here being as
random as possible is something rather
desirable so in cryptography you want
perfect randomness because that gives
you the most security symmetry breaking
works best if you have as much
randomness as possible so that these two
entities say will make completely
independent decisions of each other and
in simulation of course too because the
point of using randomness and simulation
is to simulate random processes so you
want to model that as good as possible
now for NP complete problems this
doesn't work because foreign p complete
problems we don't want perfect
randomness what we are looking for is a
needle in a haystack and finding a
needle in a haystack simply by poking it
from a few random directions won't
really help and that is why we need to
direct our randomness let's say you use
randomness in a very naive way to solve
click and just assign all of the
vertices random values of 0 and 1 now
let's say you're doing this for a graph
with n vertices well actually I think
you can answer this question if I give
you four choices from which to choose so
is it one over N squared is it one half
to the power of n is it one half times N
or is it two to the power of n over N
squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
