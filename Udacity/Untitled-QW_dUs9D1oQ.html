I'd like to show you how I use a screen
reader on everyday basis in this
particular case I will be using one of
my daily things and that is looking at a
public forum that talks about
accessibility issues for the Android
operating system
you will notice that my screen reader
speaks really fast as a beginner user
you tend to listen at much slower speeds
but as you gain efficiency with the
screen reader you will find that making
it speak faster improves efficiency when
browsing content on websites so back to
my public forum I'm gonna go to group's
website okay let's open a can opener
visit my Christine's since I used this
website every day I know that it
provides a lot of shortcut keys they're
allowing me to browse this website much
faster so first I'll go to my groups and
now I will be using a screen reader
functionality that allows me to browse
through the links on this webpage
because I'd like to find a specific
public forum I'm looking for listen you
join visit our three visit our three
first visit Google 3 here you will see I
have a few message threads and quite
recently I heard about this new app
called Swift
it's a Braille keyboard that allows
people who are blind to type Braille
faster on Android so I'm gonna go back
to this thread and look at some of the
problem looking at messages that are
included in this thread I use again
shortcut keys to quickly move through
messages thank you like yes Oct 9
sorry I'm trying to be okay they're
using me some idea as to what people may
have responded since the last time I
look to this thread so I'm gonna go back
and see if there's anything new since
the last time I looked at this forum
there's quite a bit to read sorry but
anyway I hope this gives you a quick
glance into how I use a screen reader on
everyday basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
