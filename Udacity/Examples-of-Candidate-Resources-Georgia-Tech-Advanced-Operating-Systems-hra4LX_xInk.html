and not performance conscious if
exokernel has to validate the key every
time for the library to use it well it
depends on what we mean by a resource
let's look at some examples here is an
example of a candidate resource at TLB
entry TLB entry is going to establish a
mapping between a virtual page to a
physical page that mapping of the
virtual page to the physical page is
done by the library now once that
mapping has been done by the library it
presents the mapping to the exokernel
along with the capability or the key the
encrypted key that it has for a
particular TLB entry exokernel validates
it and puts this mapping into the
specific TLB entry of the hardware TLB
now this is a privileged operation
putting an entry into the hardware TLB
is a privileged operation the library
operating system cannot do it by itself
because it doesn't have the same
privilege as exokernel and therefore
once that capability in the form of the
encrypted key for this TLB entry is
presented to exokernel then exokernel on
behalf of that operating system is
putting that mapping that has been
established by the library operating
system into the specific TLB entry of
the hardware TLB once this entry has
been put into the TLB the process that
is going to be using that virtual page
when it is running can use this multiple
times without exokernel intervention so
even though putting it into the hardware
TLB required the intervention of
exokernel because we are messing with
hardware once that entry has been put in
that entry is on behalf of this library
operating system and processes of that
library operating system when they are
running on the CPU can access the TLB
and do the translation any
of times because all of that is
happening on the hardware control and
exokernel of course is not in the middle
of any of that so that gives you an idea
of how even though we are saying that in
order to do certain things in the
hardware you need the exokernel help for
the library operating system the normal
use of a hardware resource is not going
to be in any way affected by the fact
that exokernel is in the middle between
the hardware and the library operating
systems here is another example of a
candidate resource let's say that the
operating system wants to install a
packet filter that needs to be executed
every time a network packet arrives on
behalf of a library operating system
predicates for looking at this incoming
packet are loaded into the kernel by the
library operating system now this is a
heavy duty operation because you're
doing it with the help of exokernel but
once those predicates have been loaded
into exokernel by the library operating
system on every packet arrival exokernel
will automatically check it using those
predicates so those are examples of
candidate resources that tell you that
establishing the binding may be
expensive but using the binding once
established does not incur the
intervention by exokernel and therefore
it can happen at hardware speeds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
