decide whether a sample is different
from a population parameter the rest of
this lesson will be easy we're going to
use these same concepts to compare two
samples that are dependent their
dependent when the same subject takes
the test twice this is a within-subject
design one example is when each subject
is assigned to conditions in random
order for example there in the control
condition and then they get a treatment
or maybe there are two kinds of
treatments that they're trying to test
another example is if every subject is
given a pretest and then a post-test in
another example is growth over time
otherwise known as a longitudinal study
and then we'll measure the variable for
each subject at one point in time and
then again at another point in time when
we have these within-subject designs we
have paired data this column of x i's
would correspond to the variable
measurements of one condition or of the
pretest or of some point in time and
then the Y values would correspond to a
second treatment or a post-test or a
measurement at another point in time and
then what we want to do is look at the
difference between these values will
call this D sub I and that's just the x
values minus the Y values or it could be
the opposite we're really just concerned
with the absolute difference now we
follow the same procedure as we did
before with the one-sample t-test except
we use the values of d</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
