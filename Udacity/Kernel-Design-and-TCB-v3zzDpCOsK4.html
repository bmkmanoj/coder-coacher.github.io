design at the heart or the center or
core of it what really goes into it what
is included in the trusted computing
base when it is done using the security
colonel kind of an approach so we said
well in last one we saying everything
that is necessary for mechanisms that
are necessary for correct enforcement of
security policies we want to have in the
system should go there we know that
resources are implemented using physical
resources we have so any i/o that's
necessary to access your physical
resources primitive i/o has to be
handled in there which includes clocks
interrupt handling at least capturing
the interrupt and being able to directly
access the hardware resources with
whatever capabilities that are necessary
for it in memory for example we said we
have T lbs or speeding up the address
translation process and things like that
so who can manipulate those controls
were part of memory and somebody can use
that kind of stuff if you're doing
mandatory access control then there's
label checking or that the model is
going to rely on notion of labels and
making sure secret information doesn't
flow into it object that is unclassified
and things like that so that's part of
your security policy and the correct
enforcement of course has to be
implemented by the security kernel and
direct access to hardware resources in
their manipulation and and support for
these various models for access control
we have has to be in that the other
thing we did is sort of virtualization
one way we get sort of a complete
mediation and you can bypass it is that
untrusted code is has handles for
virtual resources unless we're talking
about capability based system so these
verses ation we're putting this
mechanism going from virtual to physical
resources helps us isolate the hardware
from untrusted code also allows us to do
this separation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
