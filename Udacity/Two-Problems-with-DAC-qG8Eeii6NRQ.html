problems that doc has the first problem
is that although the owner of a resource
owner of a file let's say when it
happens to be Alice controls who this
file can be shared with and Alice gives
Bob access to read this file the problem
arises because alice is not going to be
able to control if the information is
going to stay with her and Bob only so
the problem is can bob share this
information further with somebody else
one problem that we have here with the
DAC model is that although we can
control direct access to our files but
how that information can be shared with
others we're not able to fully control
that particular this is problem is
called the information flow control
problem so information was shared with
Bob flows from Alice to Bob but can it
flow further and in the discretion
access control model we're not able to
control this flow going from Bob to
Charlie there's another problem that
discretionary access control has and
this is way because of the idea that
resource is owned by the user and it is
at his discretion who it can be shared
with well in many organizations
companies it's really not at your
discretion you're an employee of a
company and the company actually
controls how certain type of data should
be shared in that company or outside of
that in other words the employer the
company where the user works actually
may be able to mandate or will mandate
actually how certain kind of sensitive
data could be shared so to address these
two problems we're actually going to
explore another model for access control
it's called the mandatory access control
model and it's called mandatory access
control because it is not at the
discretion of the user discretionary
access control is at the discretion of
the owner of a resource but here
organization is going to mandate how
data can be shared and that's why it's
called mandatory access control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
