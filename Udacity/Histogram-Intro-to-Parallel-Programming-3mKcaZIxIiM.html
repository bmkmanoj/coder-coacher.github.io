called a histogram now what's a
histogram it's a means of categorizing
and usually displaying data that varies
with a particular measurement in
practice to create a histogram we take a
measurement for each item in a
population and then place those
measurements into a set of bins that we
define where each bin covers a certain
range of measurements this is much
easier to explain with an example I'm
recording this lecture at Udacity
headquarters in Palo Alto California so
let's say I walk out on the street in
Palo Alto and record the height of each
of the next 100 adults that happen to
walk by what that gets me is a list of
100 measurements here's what that list
might look like but it's difficult to
draw conclusions from such a list
instead what I'll do is create a
histogram I'm going to specify a number
of bins for instance four bins shorter
than 150 centimeters between 150 and 165
centimeters between 165 and 180
centimeters and taller than 180
centimeters then I'll place each
measurement into it's been so every time
someone walks by I place another tick
mark into the bin here for instance we
might end up with the measurements 12 34
38 60 out of a hundred people often in
statistics you might want to plot this
histogram which might give you a curve
that tells you something interesting
about the data let me introduce you to
one specific operation you might want to
do on a histogram of data because you'll
be doing this in your assignment for the
histogram we just showed here we might
want to compute the answer to the
question if I'm this tall how many
people are shorter than me for all bins
in the histogram this computation is
called the cumulative distribution
function on a histogram it's also known
as a definite integral we want to
compute the cumulative distribution
function on this histogram the input of
the histogram is an array of values for
instance 12 34 38 16 in one word or two
words to be a little more precise what
is the operation we need to do to this
input to get the cumulative distribution
function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
