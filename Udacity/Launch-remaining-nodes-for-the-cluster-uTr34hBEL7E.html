cluster from the Umbar a node image
launched six instances these should also
be m three large instances and give them
30 gigabytes of storage each call it
something like ambari node and otherwise
set all the options like before once the
instances are launched you'll want to
configure the security rules you'll need
the internal hostnames the private dns
of each of your instances so copy these
into a file mine looks like this the
host names also show the IP addresses of
each instance these numbers here this
one is 17 23 11 5 28 you need to allow
for communication between the nodes by
opening all the ports on the subnet
containing the instances look the IP
addresses note the network number the
first set of numbers and the IP address
here it's 172 but for you it might be
different check out the security group
for the nodes then edit the inbound
rules create a new custom TCP rule set
the port to a range from 0 to 65535 and
the source to X 0 0 to 0 / 8 where X is
your network number in my case it's 172
but again for you it's probably
different this allows the nose to
connect to other hosts on the subnet
with IP addresses starting with X 17 to
make sure this rules add it to the
ombari server as well if you don't know
about subnets and want to learn more
check out our networking course i'll
give you the link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
