HTML and JavaScript based on whitespace
we also have to take into account
comments and comments in HTML serve the
same purpose that they do in Python
documentation or removing functionality
you can add a comment containing English
taxes to explain what a program should
be doing you can do the same with a
webpage or with a JavaScript program or
you could comment out a function or a
line to see how things behave without it
in HTML comments start with this
interesting 4 character sequence and end
with this 3 character sequence left
angle bang - - begins a comment
bang-bang right angle ends a comment
they look a bit like tags so here I have
an HTML fragment I think therefore and
then there's a comment
I am japones don't you sweet we're going
to see how to implement this in our
lexical analyzer but recall that our
lexical analyzer was just based on
regular expressions I could recognize
these comments with another finite state
machine and all I have to do is just
merge these two finite state machines
together conceptually so if I could have
one set of rules describing comments and
another set of rules describing all of
my other tokens I'll just put them
together into one big machine it might
have too many states for us to be
comfortable with but it is entirely fine
for a computer when we're processing a
comment normal rules don't apply let's
consider a super tricky comment example
here we have welcome to bold tag my
comment that closes the bold tag web
page close the bold tag again the
question for you is how will this render
which of these words will be bolded well
it turns out that when something is in a
comment we ignore it entirely it's as if
it weren't there so even though this
looks like it's closing the bold tag it
does not
and the words my and webpage will both
be bolded in fact it's almost as if
everything in the comments were entirely
erased and had no impact on the final
rendering of the webpage at all and now
without the distracting text it's
relatively clear that my end webpage
should both be bolded so here I've
written another HTML fragment that
includes a comment and the quiz for you
is in multiple multiple choice fashion
to tell me which of the following HTML
tokens and I'll draw them now could be
found by our lexer so check all that
apply
based on this string assuming that we've
added the right rules for comments to
our lexer which of the following would
be found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
