numbers is eight tenths and the greatest
common factor for these two numbers is
three and five tenths nice thinking if
you got these two factors we know eight
tenths divides into one and six tenths
two times so this simplifies to 2 and 8
tenths divides into two and four tenths
three times for these two numbers three
and five tenths divides into itself one
time and three and five tenths divides
into 72 times we've removed a common
factor from the numerator and the
denominator since they simplify to 1
this leaves us with three times 1 in the
numerator and 2 times 2 in the
denominator so we'll have 3/4 times 10
to the third 34 is 75 hundreds so we
have point 7 5 times 10 to the 3rd
moving this decimal place one spot to
the right we would decrease by a power
of 10 so this number is the same as
seven and five tenths times 10 to the
second notice how this number is in
scientific notation since this number
right here is between 1 and 10 the
number above it isn't in scientific
notation since the absolute value of
this number is not between one and ten
so for our final answer we know that
this division simplifies to seven and
five tenths times 10 to the second or
just 750</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
