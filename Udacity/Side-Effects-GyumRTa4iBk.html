looked at have been query operations
that is they've been asking about the
values of attributes however in
interesting information systems in
addition to querying you need to have
operations that actually change the
state of things and so if this is going
to be ultimately implemented with a
database you need the ability to add
records to change records and that sort
of thing we call particular operations
that don't make any changes like this
pure as in pure functions because
they're similar to mathematical
functions which always compute the same
result functions which are impure are
said to have side effects and side
effects might be changing the values in
the database they might be doing io
operations input/output operations or
flashing something on the screen that
the user sees whatever it is though so
those are side effects and so now as the
next next step in our modeling of these
requirements let's try to specify a more
complex situation one where an operation
actually results in a change of state in
this case we choose to model the actual
process of checking out a learnable item
as indicated in requirement 5 a patron
can check out books or audio-visual
materials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
