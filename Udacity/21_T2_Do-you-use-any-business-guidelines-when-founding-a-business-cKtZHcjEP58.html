and planning and maybe over planning in
a business there's a real danger for
startups I think or at least it's been
my experience that people who are not
may be directly involved in the process
of creating the thing that's at the core
of the business maybe in like a software
company it's the engineers or marketing
company it's the ads or what-have-you
the people who are making the decisions
if they're too disconnected from the
actual acts of of the company there is a
real problem where they could create
plans that are just disconnected from
the actual realities of the business and
we've been I can't provide off the top
of my head any direct examples because I
just forgetting all of them right now
but we've seen companies fail the time
for misdirection bad planning not
understanding what business you're
actually in so especially in startups
where you are effectively building a
business that has no roadmap you cannot
build a road map in advance of that you
can only reflect on the things that
others have done before
usually you're going to get that wrong
the whole purpose of a start-up is to
carve a new path on you know in an area
where there are no paths and trying to
calculate in advance too far where
you're trying to go or what you're
trying to do or how you're going to get
there can actually lead you
way off base from where you're trying to
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
