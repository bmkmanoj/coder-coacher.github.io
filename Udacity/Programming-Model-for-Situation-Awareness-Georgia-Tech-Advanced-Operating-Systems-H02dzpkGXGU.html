for a video analytics application let's
say I'm interested in detecting and
tracking some anomalous event so have
cameras which captures the images from a
particular environment and you're
detecting for something specific maybe
you're looking for key shores face in
every camera frame and once you detect
Kishore's face then you say well this
guy is a suspicious individual let's
track him as he moves around so the
tracking is taking a particular object
of interest for the domain and asking
the question what is happening to that
object as time moves on and in the
process of tracking you are recognizing
who that person is if there are multiple
people in a particular environment
you're recognizing the specific
individual that you may be interested in
and if that individual is recognized
then perhaps you want to raise an alarm
so this is just a simple pipeline of
tasks to illustrate what domain expert
may be doing in a video analytics
application so such a domain expert is
an expert in writing detection
algorithms and tracking algorithms and
recognition algorithms so that they can
process the video stream in real time to
generate Ilan's so the objective in
situation awareness applications is to
process these streams of data for
high-level inference in other words we
are not watching a YouTube video but
we're using these sensor streams to
derive high level inference as to what
is happening in the environment that's
what is the nature of situation
awareness applications as i mentioned
video analytics is in the purview of a
domain expert like a vision researcher
or a developer who knows how to write
sophisticated detection tracking and
recognition algorithms but how do we
scale that up to thousands of camera
if an object is moving from one camera
to another these are the kinds of things
that the domain expert for situation
awareness may have to worry about this
is where systems can come in with
programming models that alleviate the
pain points of a domain expert
developing situation awareness
applications persistent temporal streams
which is the focal point of this
particular lesson is just one example
are of a distributed programming system
for catering to the needs of situation
awareness applications such as what I
described to you just now I want to
stress the fact that pts is just an
exemplar not the last word but it is
good to look at one concrete example of
a distributed programming system that
can help reduce the pain points in
developing situation awareness
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
