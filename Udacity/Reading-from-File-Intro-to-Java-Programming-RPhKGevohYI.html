that determines the largest of a number
of input values but that program had an
annoying flaw the user had to type in
all of the values and if they're all of
them that can get really tedious what we
really want to do is read the values
from a file to read a value from a file
you can use the scan or class but you
construct a scanner with an object of a
file class editor and you need to
construct that file object by giving the
name of the input file now there's a bit
of a catch here when we put this code
inside the main method we need to deal
with the possibility that there is no
file called input text if that file was
indeed missing then the file constructor
will terminate with what's called a file
not found exception that exception is
considered so serious that we must tell
Java that we are aware of it that's done
by putting this clause throws
filenotfoundexception
behind main we're not covering exception
handling in this course so this is just
another one of those things that I'm
gonna have to ask you to just do once
we're done with this everything else is
easy now the scanner works every bit as
the scanner you've been using quite a
bit you can simply call has next double
and then read a value by calling next
double well have a go at it modify the
program that computes the largest value
so that it reads the values from a file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
