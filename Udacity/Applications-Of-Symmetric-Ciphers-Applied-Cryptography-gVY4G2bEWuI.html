ciphers in unit 2 we're going to learn
about how to apply symmetric ciphers to
solve problems so for the rest of this
course we're mostly going to view
ciphers as black boxes they provide two
functions encrypt and decrypt and
cryptic CIN a message from some message
space and produces a ciphertext and it
also takes in a key from some key space
decrypt is the inverse it takes in a
ciphertext and a message and if it takes
in the same key it will produce the same
message that we got and our correctness
property is that the decryption with the
same key of a message encrypted with
that key gives us the same message for
the rest of this unit we're going to
assume that we have some function that
provides encryption and decryption AES
is a good choice for most applications
and we're going to look at how to use
these functions to solve problems the
first thing we're going to look at
though is how we actually get this key
all of our assumptions about security
depend on this key and we have two key
assumptions the first is that that K is
selected randomly and uniformly this
means each key is equally likely to be
selected and there's no predictability
about what the key is the other big
assumption about the key is that it can
be kept secret the adversary can't learn
the key but it can be shared between the
two endpoints this is a big challenge
we're not going to look at that yet this
unit we'll get to that later
this is the big problem of key
distribution which we'll talk about
starting in unit 3 now I want to talk
about this first problem though that we
need to select a random key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
