it's because the developers of the
commercial software systems aren't doing
it or at least not doing it enough and I
think it's pretty clear that the kind of
bugs found for example in the fuzzing
papers or in Charlie Miller's talk
wouldn't have been there in the software
if the developers of Adobe Acrobat or of
the UNIX utilities had had a reasonably
aggressive random testing program and
remember that the some of those bugs
Charlie Miller was talking about we're
security vulnerabilities these are
things that they really don't want in
their software and so what I'd argue the
software development efforts
don't make proper use of random testing
are flawed and the reason that these
efforts are flawed is because modern
software systems are so large and so
complicated the test case is produced by
non-random processes are simply unlikely
to find the kind of bugs that are
lurking in these software systems and so
what that leaves us with is a question
well what should they have done how does
how should how random testing supposed
to work so let me give some ideas about
that what I'm gonna do here is show sort
of a rough software development timeline
for releasing software over here and
early development stages over here and
so we've looked at mainly so far in this
course is random unit testing so we're
developing the software units and what
we're trying to do is make sure that
they are robust enough so when we start
composing them together later
they'll be a solid foundation so we've
looked at several cases of for example
with the queue bounded queue here we
looked at fuzzing the interfaces that it
provides we also looked at an example of
random fault injection and that was for
the for the read all function and if you
remember that was the function that was
supposed to cope with was supposed to
cope with the fact that the UNIX read
system call can do can display partial
success so there were doin fault
injection so we were fuzzing the
interface used by the read all call not
the interface that it provides and so
like I say what we want to do is ensure
as we're developing the modules that
we're creating robust pieces of software
whose interfaces we understand and that
are going to be a solid foundation for
future work so I we start developing
more elaborate software stacks it's
going to be the case that some of our
random testers become useless so for
example if we have a queue instantiated
here that's used by some more
sophisticated piece of software we no
longer are interested in the ability to
randomly test the interface provided by
the queue because it's simply being used
by the rest of the software on the other
hand other kinds of random testers such
as those that come in at the top level
and those that perform system of a fault
injection are absolutely still usable
you are absolutely still useful and in
fact also injection of things like
erroneous responses to system calls are
really important things to test
larger pieces of software with because
typically those kind of errors could
result in failures propagating all the
way through our software stack and we'd
really like to understand how our system
responds to that sort of thing as we
approach something that's more of a
complete product our focus should be on
external interfaces provided so this is
going to be things like file i/o and the
graphical user interface and so recall
if you recall those fuzzing papers were
fuzzing exactly these sorts of things
they were delivering random bits through
the file interfaces and they were
delivering random GUI events to
applications and knocking over a pretty
large proportion of applications that
they tested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
