because the developers of the commercial
software systems aren't doing it or at
least not doing it enough I think it's
pretty clear that the kind of bugs found
for example in the fuzzing papers or in
Charlie Miller's talk wouldn't have been
there in the software if the developers
of adobe acrobat or of the unix
utilities had had a reasonably
aggressive random testing program and
remember that the sum of those bugs
Charlie Miller was talking about where
security vulnerabilities these are
things that they really don't want in
their software and so what I'd argue the
software development efforts don't make
proper use of random testing are flawed
and the reason that these efforts are
flawed is because modern software
systems are so large and so complicated
the test case is produced by non random
processes are simply unlikely to find
the kind of bugs that are lurking in
these software systems and so if that
leaves us with is a question but what
should they have done how should house
random testing supposed to work so let
me give some ideas about that what I'm
going to do here is show sort of a rough
software development timeline for
releasing software over here and early
development stages over here and so
we've looked at mainly so far in this
course is random unit testing so we're
developing the software units what we're
trying to do is make sure that they are
robust enough when we start composing
them together later the W solid
foundation so we've looked at several
cases of for example with the Q bounded
queue here we looked at fuzzing the
interfaces that it provides we also
looked at an example of random fault
injection and that was for the for the
read all function and if you remember
that was the function that was supposed
to cope with was supposed to cope with
the fact that the UNIX read system call
can do can display partial success so
there were doing fault injection so we
were fuzzing the interface used by the
read all call not the interface that it
provides and so like I say what we want
to do is ensure as we're developing the
modules that we're creating robust
pieces of software whose interfaces we
understand and that are going to be a
solid foundation for future work so I
always start developing more elaborate
software stacks it's going to be the
case that some of our random testers
become useless so for example if we have
a queue instantiated here that's used by
some more sophisticated piece of
software we no longer are interested in
the ability to randomly test the
interface provided by the queue because
it's simply being used by the rest of
the software on the other hand other
kinds of random testers such as those
that come in at the top level and those
that perform system of a fault injection
are absolutely still usable you are
absolutely still useful and in fact
halts injection of things like erroneous
responses to system calls are really
important things to
larger pieces of software with because
typically those kind of errors could
result in failure is propagating all the
way through our software stack and we'd
really like to understand how our system
responds to that sort of thing as we
approach something that's more of a
complete product our focus should be on
external interfaces provided so this is
going to be things like file i/o and the
graphical user interface and so recall
if you recall those fuzzing papers were
fuzzing exactly these sorts of things
they were delivering random bits through
the file interfaces and they were
delivering random gooey events to
applications and knocking over a pretty
large proportion of applications as they
tested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
