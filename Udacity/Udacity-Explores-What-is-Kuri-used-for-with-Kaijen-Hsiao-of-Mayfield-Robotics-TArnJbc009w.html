your home his goal is to bring a spark
of life to your home we like to say that
we make home robots that are joyful
useful and inspiring and each of those
things is as important as the other to
the robot needs to provide joy so that
you want to adopt him into your home in
the first place he has to be useful so
that he earns a place in your home
asking people to bring a robot into her
home and make a place for him have a
spot permanently as a thing that turtles
are on their home on regular basis he
has to be useful on a daily basis and
provide great utility but also he has to
be inspiring one of the main goals of
the company is to inspire people to
build more home robots especially
children children see the robot for the
first time and they instantly many of
them will say things like oh now I want
to build robots someday I want I'm going
to build robots to do all these really
cool things and we want to inspire a
whole generation of kids to think that
home robots are a normal thing to just
have around in your house and to bring
more robots into the world like carry
and much better than curry so hopefully
with my lifetime we can actually get to
having something like groceries the
robot from the Jetsons so in terms of
actual functions well curry has a camera
in his eye and he has microphones and he
has speakers and he has ability to map
and navigate around the home and he can
recognize people and pets and all of
those features combined into a lot of
different use cases that are useful to
people so for instance curry can drive
to where you are in the house and the
play your favorite music or your
favorite podcasts curry can read an
audio book to your kid when it's time
for the kids go to bed and this is
apparently very popular Grist families
apparently reading possum socks to your
kids for the 30th time gets pretty old
but curry does not mind reading for the
30th time it's the same as the first
also curry can let you know when it's
your kids have come home from school to
notify you and he can drive around and
you can use him to check on whether your
dogs on the couch and you can talk
through his speakers and say like get
off the couch that's one of our CEOs
favorite use cases my favorite use case
is actually around taking pictures and
video of your pets and your loved ones I
have two cats on a bunny and I travel a
lot so I really want to know when I'm
gone are they okay and also I would
select see pictures of them being really
cute so I'm not even there but I can
still see their adorable antics
you know when I'm gone and so all these
things are enabled by all the
robotic features and there's so many
more things that we can do Korean
basically is like a smart pet we aim for
pet not pet like not Butler like is what
we'd like to say and so he he's supposed
to give up intelligence kind of like
your dog you don't expect your dog to
talk back to you you don't expect your
dog to understand you every time but
your dog is useful and adorable and you
like having them in your home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
