general the Internet's just a special
kind of network there are lots of
different ways to define network we're
going to use quite a precise definition
so we're gonna define a network as a
group of entities and the entities could
be people they could be computers they
could be organizations they could be
governments that can communicate even
though they're not all directly
connected so here's an example to show
what that definition means so we have
Alice and we have Bob and Alice and Bob
know each other and can talk to each
other the way they talk we can call the
channel that could be just talking in
person that could be talking over a
telephone we're going to say that just
this is not enough to be a network this
is just two people having a conversation
if we had the second scenario we'll say
we have Alice Bob and Charlie and Alice
can communicate with Bob Bob can
communicate with Charlie and Charlie can
communicate with Alice but they can do
all this directly they're all directly
connected if Alice wants to talk to
Charlie well she has a direct link to
Charlie she doesn't need to use Bob
there's no way to communicate other than
across these direct links so even in
this case where there are three people
who can all communicate we're still
going to say that's not a network many
people would call both of these networks
we're going to use a somewhat more
precise definition where neither of
these would be considered a network what
would be considered network is this
third example and in the third example
we have three nodes we have Alice Bob
and Charlie we'll say there are three
people but now Alice is not directly
connected to Charlie but there's a way
that Alice can send a message to Charlie
and she can send the message because Bob
will forward the message for her once
the message goes through two hops to
make it so two people are not directly
connected can communicate and maybe
Charlie can also send messages back to
Alice then we call it a network so
that's going to be our definition there
has to be at least three entities and
there has to be a way that entities that
are not directly connected
can still communicate so to see that you
understand that definition of a network
and maybe also know a little bit about
world history we're gonna have a quiz so
here the possible answers 10 years old
30 years old 100 years old a thousand
years old or over 3,000 years old</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
