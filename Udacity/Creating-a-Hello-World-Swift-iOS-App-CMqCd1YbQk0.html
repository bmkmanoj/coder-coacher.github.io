swift iOS app in xcode let's go to file
new and project we're going to select
single View application we're going to
make sure we have the application
section selected under iOS and click
next we'll type in the name of our
product now this iOS app is your first
iOS app let's call it pitch perfect you
can put in whatever organization name
you would like an identifier we're going
to cover that in a little bit make sure
the language selected is Swift that is
set to universal and you don't need to
use core data right now we're going to
use it in a later project with that
click Next select the location that you
like to put it for me here I'm just
going to put it straight in the desktop
go ahead and click create Xcode will now
create a new iOS app called pitch
perfect and automatically create some
needed files and settings for you here
you can see the iOS app that Xcode has
automatically created for you it has an
appt delegate class that will listen to
system events such as being called when
your app starts when you get a memory
warning and when your app is sent to the
background there's also a view
controller in an empty view will add
more to those soon for now you can add a
single line into the app delegate to a
function that gets called when the app
launch is called application did finish
launching with options this one minor
code will print out hello world to the
council so here we are here and we can
see that in green Xcode has highlighted
comments for us and this function that
we're talking about here is the one
where we want to add a line in the app
delegate inside the application did
finish launching with options functions
we're going to add the line print hello
world now if you click the Run button
right up here on the top left we're
actually going to run this in the iPhone
simulator you can see our brand new app
showing an all white background in the
console you see the words hello world
five minutes and you've already created
an iOS app although it won't win any
Apple Design Awards just yet we're going
to work to build it and improve it
throughout this course first let's take
a closer look at Xcode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
