another lecture of mechanisms or methods
that are they're not sort of current
computer vision research or really the
state of the art in computer vision but
they are very important methods that we
make use of all the time for a variety
of operations and what we're going to
talk about today is really some binary
image analysis there are lots of times
that we produce images that are
essentially zeros and ones one talks to
at where zero is a background and one is
a foreground so for example I might be
looking effect we talked about
background subtraction when we were
doing detection of moving objects right
and so basically the ones where the
stuff was supposed to be moving and the
zeros were supposed to be where it
wasn't and in fact there was this
example that I showed of people sitting
on the steps of the University and we
did a median filter and then we
subtracted them off we did a threshold a
then I did I said we did something
called morphological operations to clean
it up today we're doing the
morphological operations and it's often
buried deep within any functioning
vision system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
