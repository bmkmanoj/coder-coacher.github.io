subsumption representation what we
already had branch coverage and
statement coverage in this case if we
want to add condition coverage to this
page we have to put it here on the side
with no relationship of substantial with
either branch coverage or statement
coverage which means that the criteria
are not comparable so now let's consider
again our last example and let's use a
different test weight this time we still
have two tests but the first one has X
is equal to zero and Y is equal to minus
five and the second one X is equal to
five and Y is equal to five as well
let's see what happens in terms of
condition coverage when we run this test
if we look at the first condition X is
equal to zero it is both true for the
first test case and false for the second
one as for the second condition y
greater than zero it is false for the
first test case and true for the second
one therefore we achieve 100% condition
coverage with these two tests but what
about branch coverage if we consider the
whole predicate instead of just the
individual conditions let's see what
happens for the two test cases if we
look at the first one because X is equal
to zero the overall predicate is true as
for the second one because the second
condition is true the overall predicate
is true in other words despite the fact
that we are exercising all the possible
values for the two conditions the
overall predicate is always true and
therefore we're coloring only one of the
two branches so our coverage will be 50%
this is the reason why normally the two
criteria that we just saw decision
coverage and condition coverage are
considered together and the resulting
criterion is called branch and condition
coverage but also decision and condition
coverage at this point the test
requirements and the coverage measure
should be pretty straightforward because
they are just considering the two
criteria together as far as the
requirements are concerned they include
all the branches and individual
conditions in the program whereas the
coverage measure is computed considering
both coverage measures both branch
coverage and condition coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
