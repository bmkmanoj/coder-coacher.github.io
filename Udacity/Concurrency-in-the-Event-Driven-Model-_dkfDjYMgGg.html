event-driven model has just one thread
then how do we achieve concurrency in
the multi process and the multi-threaded
models we had each execution context
that it's a processor a thread he and
I'll only one request at a time to
achieve concurrency we would simply add
more multiple execution context so
multiple processes or multiple threads
and then if necessary if we have fewer
CPUs than context then we would have two
contexts which among them the way the
event driven model achieves concurrency
is by interleaving the processing of
multiple requests within the same
execution context here in the
event-driven model we have a single
thread in the single thread switches its
execution among the processing that's
required for different requests let's
say we have a client request coming into
the system so it's a request for client
see one and we receive a request for a
connection that gets dispatched e-except
operation gets processed then we receive
the actual request so deep HTTP message
that gets processed that the message
gets parsed to extract the files so now
we actually need to read the file and we
initiate i/o from the reading file
handler so at that point the request for
client 1 has been processed through
several of these steps and it's waiting
on the disk i/o to complete let's in the
meantime two more requests have come in
so with client 2 and client 3 have sent
a request for a connection let's say the
client to request was picked up first
the connection was accepted and now for
the processing of client two we need to
wait for the actual HTTP message to be
received so the processing of client two
is waiting on an event from the network
that will have the HTTP message that
needs to be received and let's say
client 3 its request has been accepted
and it's currently being handled so the
client 3 request is in the accept
connection handler some amount of time
later the processing of all of these
three requests has moved a little bit
further along so the request for C 3 the
accept connection was completed and
that request is waiting on an event with
the HTTP message the request for client
to bow one perhaps for reading on the
Disgaea in order to read the file that
needs to be sent out and maybe the
request for clients see one already
started sending the file in chunks at a
time some blocks of some number of bytes
at a time so it's reading in one of
those iterations so although we have
only one execution context only one
thread if we take a look we have
concurrent execution of multiple client
requests it just happens to be
interleaved given that there is one
execution context however there multiple
at the same time multiple client
requests being handled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
