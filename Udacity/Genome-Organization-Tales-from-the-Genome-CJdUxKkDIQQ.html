two main ways it's organized are first
by compaction meaning organization by
proteins called histones let's zoom out
a bit on our DNA strand and imagine our
double-stranded DNA is just this one
purple line the first order of
organization is that DNA is going to
wrap around these histone proteins much
like you might wrap string on a spool
and you can see that it just wraps
around and around and around and this
allows for some basic organization and
the same way that loose string in a
drawer or your pocket has a tendency to
get tangled if you wrap it around an
object to keep it steady then it can't
get tangled as easily and that's the
same principle that's going on here for
organization the second way DNA is
organized to fit inside a cell is that
it's split into units called chromosomes
which are large collections of this
histone wrapped DNA you've probably seen
pictures of chromosomes before they're
usually these long large linear pieces
of DNA and histones called chromatin if
you're not sure if you've seen a
chromosome then you've probably seen
something that looks like this like an X
this is also considered a chromosome and
both of these structures are just this
compacted DNA wrapped around histones
such that we could zoom in on the
chromosome here just a very small region
and this is what we would see in the
same way that if we zoomed in here on
the DNA strand this is what we would see
here the double helix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
