computing provides traditionally
businesses would buy and configure the
resources that are needed for their
services how many resources should be
purchased and configured so what is the
capacity of those resources
well that typically would be based on
some expectations regarding the demand
for that particular business for that
particular service typically considering
the peak demand so if we have a
situation in which the demand follows
this pink or this red line then the
business would configure their resources
their capacity based on this blue line
so that it can tolerate the expected
peak in the service demand now the
expectations turn out to be not quite
accurate and the the main techni ends up
exceeding the provisioned capacity the
business will end up with a situation in
which requests have to be dropped and
there will be a lost opportunity in the
case of an emotive given the very rapid
spike in the workload this lost
opportunity would have been tremendous
instead what we would like what would be
the ideal case is if the following were
to happen the capacity or the available
resources should scale elastically with
the demand and the scaling should be
instantaneous as soon as the demand
increases the capacity should increase
stoom and then in the other direction -
as soon as the demand decreases the
capacity should decrease as well meaning
that the cost to operate these resources
the cost to support this service should
be proportional to the demand - the
revenue opportunity all of this should
happen automatically without the need
for some hacking wizardry and all these
resources can be accessed anytime from
anywhere
one potential gotcha here is that you
wouldn't necessarily own these resources
that magically appear on demand but that
may be something that you're willing to
compromise on provided that you really
do achieve these kinds of benefits and
that there is some kind of proper
assurance as to what exactly can
possibly go wrong with these resources
that you're accessing
so the goal of cloud computing is to
provide these capabilities that match
the ideal scenario as much as possible
the resulting requirements can be
distilled as follows cloud computing
should provide on the main elastic
resources and services there should be
fine-grained pricing based on usage not
for actual or potentially idle physical
servers like in the hosting data centers
that were give alternative at the time
all the resources should be
professionally managed and hosted and
all of this should be available via
api's that can be used for remote access</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
