multi-tape turing machines have the same
computational power as regular turing
machines multi tape machines certainly
don't have less power by ignoring all
but the input tape we obtain a regular
Turing machine let's see why multi tape
turing machines don't have any more
power than regular machines on the Left
we have a multi tape turing machine in
some configuration and on the right we
have created a corresponding
configuration for a single tape turing
machine on the single tape we have the
contents of the multiple tapes with each
tapes contents separated by a hash so
here's the first tape here's the second
tape here's the third tape also note
these dots here we're using a trick that
we haven't used before expanding the
size of the alphabet for every symbol in
the tape outfit of the multi tape
machine we have two symbols on the
single tape machine one with a dot and
one without we use the mark symbols to
indicate that at the head of the multi
tape machine would be over this position
on the tape so the one is marked here
the one is marked here and the zero is
marked here simulating a step of the
multi tape machine with the single tape
version happens in two phases one for
reading and one for writing first the
single tape machine simulates the
simultaneous reading of the heads of the
multi tape machine by scanning over the
input and noting which symbols have
marks on them so here it would first
note that one is under the head of the
first tape then that another one is
under the head of the second tape and
then that a zero is under the head of
the third tape that completes the first
phase where we read the symbols now we
need to update the tape contents and the
head positions or markers as part of the
writing phase let's say that the multi
tape machine changes this 0 to a 1 and
moves the head to the left like so then
on the single tape machine we need to
change this 0 dot to a 1 and change this
0 to a 0 dot note that it's possible
that one of these strings will
to increase its length when the
multi-tape writes to a position it
hasn't reached before in that case we
just right shift the tape contents to
allow room for the new symbol to be
written once all that work is done we
return the head back to the beginning to
prepare for the next path like so and
notice that I updated the tape contents
appropriately so all the information
about the configuration of a multi tape
machine can be captured in a single tape
and it's not too hard to convince
yourself that all the logic needed to
read from multiple places and remember
all that contents in order to figure out
the right writing response can also be
implemented with a state-transition
logic it's a good exercise to work that
out if it's not obvious to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
