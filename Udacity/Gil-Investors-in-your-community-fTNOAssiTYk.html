people around them because they want to
help they want to bid on a regular basis
and go through this super difficult
thing of building a startup so usually
your early investors are going to come
from the immediate vicinity around you
if there's no such investors around you
that are aligned with your business or
you feel you can reach out to I think
putting yourself in position where you
can find ways so for example if you are
not in a in a hot in in a big mature
metropolitan perhap going to an
accelerator program for a few months
perhaps thinking about where the best
place to set up your business may be
closer to your customers that might be
in a large Richard metropolitan I think
those are some of the things you should
be thinking about in order to get close
to the investors because investors it's
not about you know giving you a check
and wishing you good luck they want to
be there for you they want to help you
and for that they feel they need to be
geographically located next to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
