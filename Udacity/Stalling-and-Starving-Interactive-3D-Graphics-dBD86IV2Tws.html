quiz we found that B is the slow stage
here and B is in fact called the
bottleneck it's the slowest stage and
it's the one that determines how fast
anything is going to come out of the
pipeline and there's always a bottleneck
in the pipeline in fact there's always
some slowest stage there may be two or
three that are tied for slowest but
there's always some stage that's the
slowest objects three and four move on
through the pipeline and object two is
still being processed by B so what this
is called is when stage C is waiting for
input and nothing's coming because we're
waiting for B to finish
that's called starvation that's where C
is not getting anything until B is
totally complete on the other hand
what's happening here is stage a is
finished processing object one but
object one can't move on because stage B
is still processing object to this is
called stalling with the rendering
pipeline these same sorts of principles
apply everything the application run
efficiently and keep the GPU fed with
data is a common bottleneck for example
the bottleneck will change over time
with sometimes one stage being the
slowest sometimes another GPU designers
use different techniques to perform load
balancing such as first-in first-out
queues where you sort of stack up a
bunch of objects so that if the stage
suddenly gets faster a bunch of objects
can move into it quickly or other
techniques such as unified shaders we
won't be describing these techniques in
detail in this course but it's good to
be aware that the GPU has a lot going on
inside of it various performance
debugging tools let you see what parts
of the pipeline are bottlenecks and so
can help you improve the performance of
your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
