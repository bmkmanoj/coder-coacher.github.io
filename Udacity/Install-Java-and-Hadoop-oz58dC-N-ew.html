install now for this you'll use OpenJDK
an open-source version of java going to
type in a bunch of commands now but i'll
make them available to you so you can
copy and paste instead of trying to
memorize them the first thing to do is
update and upgrade at Linux packages
this is just good practice in general
this can take a bit so it's a good time
to make a cup of tea once that's done
install openjdk what you'll do is
download a dupe release then extract it
and move it to user local first download
the dupe archive with double you get
it'll probably think a bit to download
but your tea should be a nice drink too
much it right now so take some time to
enjoy it here two point seven point two
is the version of the release that i
downloaded when i recorded this however
you're probably watching this from the
future it's likely best to use the most
recent version in your time so you
should download that one instead you
also want to download it from a mirror
close to you i'll give you a link to a
list of mirrors where you can find one
with that downloaded you can now extract
it to user local it puts everything in a
directory with a version number let's
get rid of number rename the directory
to just hadoop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
