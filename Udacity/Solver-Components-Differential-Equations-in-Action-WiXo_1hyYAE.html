choosing an appropriate floating-point
format are just two of the issues we
encounter when we implement a solver a
program to solve a differential equation
on a higher level what may think about
reusability and maintainability this is
my graphic of rendering of the plug and
play style of implementation that's used
in the book numerical recipes with this
type of implementation you can mix and
match components which comes in very
handy for experiments let's have a
closer look one minor but vital
component is the right hand side the
right hand side of the differential
equation that is the rate of change it's
used by the algorithm the algorithm
being for instance the forward Euler
method points method and similar the
algorithm is called by the step on which
controls which steps are being made at
which size stepper is responsible to
adapt the step sizes and maybe to reduce
steps when it finds the error has grown
too large so the algorithm is only able
to do one single step the stepper calls
the algorithm the driver is the
interface to the user which of course is
a program and not a human the driver can
be sent commands to start and stop and
eventually the driver returns the data
to the user to this end it has a sub
object that's called output the output
may collect values at predefined
instances of time or it may interpolate
the data it receives from the step on to
regular time intervals the step aerobic
smaller and larger time intervals the
output may interpolate them to produce
data at regular time intervals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
