and hiring manager here at Udacity
thanks for coming thanks for having me
mad of course so what I asked you here
for is that I am trying to teach
students how to use their github profile
as a portfolio to show off their work so
I want them to get you know a sense of
what a hiring manager or a recruiter
actually looks for from the github
profile okay yeah so just start out what
is your role as a hiring manager well as
a hiring manager really it's it's a
collaborative role where I work with
engineers on the team and leadership and
we sort of figure out you know what
attributes do we value engineers and
then we work closely with you know we
have amazing recruiters and HR people
here we work closely with them to sort
of figure out how do we best screen for
those attributes and then of course I
spent a lot of time actually doing
interviews you know screening people
looking at people's github repos yeah
they're LinkedIn's and whatnot and just
trying to get a sense of the candidates
and then making a hiring decision cool
so when you're looking at a github
profile what's the first thing you look
at and then why is it important well
yeah the first thing I look at is that
sort of heat map at the bottom with the
activity though the different shades of
green because that just gives me a
really good sense of does this person
Charlie passionate about coding yeah and
do they contribute often it doesn't have
to be like all the time but you see like
sort of steady patterns and I found it
that just correlates with success in the
workplace you know people that love to
code awesome and so when you're after
your initial impressions like you know
looking at this activity chart so what's
the the next thing you look like what
else do you look at to get a sense of
the candidate well for me the next step
is just to say okay well you're here the
repos I've created here the repos they
contributed to you know where have they
done the meatiest work and like pick one
of those and just dig in and I'll just
spend you know sometimes an hour just
reading their code and trying to get a
sense for the kind of it you know
engineer they are also sometimes it's
dig into you know have they contributed
to other github repos issues how do they
interact with other people in those
discussions and whatnot
they good collaborator you know are they
patients you know that sort of thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
