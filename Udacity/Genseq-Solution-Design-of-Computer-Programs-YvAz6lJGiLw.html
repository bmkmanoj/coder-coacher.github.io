returns all the values it builds up are
correct but unfortunately it doesn't
know is returned let's try to figure out
why so in thinking about this we want to
think about a recursive pattern so let's
look at the pattern X plus we've defined
X plus as being the sequence of X
followed by X star and now for most
instances of X that's not a problem so
if we had plus of the literal a not
going to be a problem that's going to
generate eh eh eh eh eh and so on but
consider this ok let's define a equals
literal of a pat equals plus of optional
a now this should be the same this
should also generate a AAA AAA and the
way we can see that is we have a plus so
that generates any number of these if we
pick a once we get this if we pick a
twice we get this if we pick 83 times we
get this but the problem is there's all
these other choices in between so
optional a means we can either be
picking a or the empty string and so we
could be as we go through the loop for
plus we could pick empty string empty
string empty string empty string we
could pick empty string an infinite
number of times and even though our n is
finite so at some point we're going to
ask for pattern of some n let's say the
list 1 2 3 or the set 1 2 3 we won't
have a problem with having an infinite
number of A's but we will have a problem
of choosing from the optional a the
empty part and so if an infinite number
of times we choose the empty string
rather than choosing a then we're never
going to get past 3 as the highest value
and so we're going to keep going forever
so that's the problem we got to somehow
say I don't want to keep choosing the
empty string I want to make progress and
choose something each time through so
how can we make sure that happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
