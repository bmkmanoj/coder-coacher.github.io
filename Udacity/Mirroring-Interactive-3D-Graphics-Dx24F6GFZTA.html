mention is the mirror matrix also called
the reflection matrix this matrix
usually has one element here be a
negative one and the other two are ones
for example here's a mirror matrix that
mirrors the Z coordinate this transform
makes the z axis act something like a
mirror anything on one side of the
access is mirrored to the other you can
create a mirror matrix easily enough in
3gs by setting a scale value to negative
1 there are in fact an infinite number
of mirroring matrices since by rotation
and translation you can move the
mirroring plane one major problem with
the mirroring matrix is that it not only
flips the triangle it also flips the
sense of the triangle using a mirroring
matrix converts from right-handed
coordinate system to a left-handed one
or vice versa that is in a right-handed
system of triangles vertices normally
proceed counterclockwise around its edge
after a mirror matrix this ordering is
reversed if you're using back face
culling for example you have to reverse
the culling sense for making the front
side visible to the back side visible
even with this I find that marrying
matrices are tricky to use in 3gs by
default the reversal also affects
lighting for example making it look like
lights are coming from the opposite
direction maybe you'll have better luck
and if so put it in the forums one place
we're mirroring sometimes is used is one
modeling instead of sculpting a whole
moth for example you can make half a
moth you then use a mirroring matrix to
create the other half sometimes you
might encounter matrix in a data file
and don't know where it came from it
might be a mirror so that could really
mess you up you can use the matrix for
determining call to see if there's any
mirroring in the matrix if the
determinant is negative it contains a
mirror</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
