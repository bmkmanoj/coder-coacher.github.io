different there's no sensible base case
that gives us a good recursive
definition what we're doing to do
instead is what's called the relaxation
other than and the basic idea is pretty
simple we're gonna start with a guess
and then we're gonna have some loop
where we keep going we'll just say while
we're not done we'll figure out how to
decide when we're done we're gonna do
something to make the guess better so
that's the basic idea that we don't have
a good stopping point we don't have a
clear starting point of saying Alice
popularity is one and we're gonna define
everything in that what we're gonna do
instead is we're gonna start with the
guests and our guests could be well
let's assume everyone's initial
popularity is one and then we're gonna
keep refining the guests we're gonna
have some process that updates the
guests based on what we've learned and
each time we do this we're gonna get
better and better and at some point
we're gonna stop and we're gonna say
well that's the result we want so let's
think about how to do that for
popularity scores so instead of just
having one input to popularity now
there's gonna be two it's gonna take the
time step that's the number of times
we've tried to guess and it's going to
take the person and it's still gonna
output a score and now we can define
this in a way that we do have a starting
point which is the equivalent to having
a stopping point in a recursive
definition
we'll define what the value is at step
zero for any person will say that the
score is one and it didn't work to have
a base case in terms of the person
because there's no clear ordering of the
people we had a graph we had lots of
different friendship connections there
was no clear starting point we're gonna
add an extra parameter which is our time
step and that's going to be our base
case and if we think of our time step as
our base case it's easy to see a that
time step zero is our base case and at
step zero we're gonna say everyone's
popularity score is one and now we can
have our update rule which says we can
figure out the popularity at any time
step T where T is greater than zero for
any person and we're going to define
that as the sum over all their friends
so we're gonna pick a friend
in their set of friends so we're gonna
go through each friend summing up the
popularity score of the friend but
instead of at time t we're gonna use
time t minus one so that means we're
looking for the popularity of the friend
in the previous step and we're using
that to compute the popularity of the
person they're friends with in this step
so let me write out that more in
pseudocode if we think of this as a
Python procedure it's going to be
something where we're taking in two
inputs now the time and the person and
now we have the base case if the time is
zero we're going to return the score is
always 1 if the time is not zero well we
can compute the score similar to how we
did before we're going to have the score
zero we're gonna sum over the friends
we're summing over their friends
updating the score by adding the friends
popularity score at the previous step
and when we're done the value of score
is the result so now we have our new
definition we have it written in
mathematical notation at the top and in
the Python code here so the question is
is this a good recursive definition and
I don't mean to ask whether it's a good
definition of popularity let's hope it's
not what I mean to ask is for all
possible inputs so all values we could
pass in as T and P does the way we've
defined popularity give us a result so
here the possible choices so yes it's
good only if people can't be friends
with himself it's good only if everyone
has at least one friend hopefully
everyone does but it's only a good
definition if that's the case or only if
everyone is more popular than Alice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
