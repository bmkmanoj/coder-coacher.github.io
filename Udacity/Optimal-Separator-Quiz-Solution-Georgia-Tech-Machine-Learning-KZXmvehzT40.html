yeah it's interesting so I guess I guess
it really does make some intuitive sense
that the line is really really nailed
down by the points close to it and the
points that are far away from it really
don't have any influence so I would put
non zero sorry I would put zero alphas
on the lower left hand - and the one of
the upper plusses yes and you know I
haven't actually worked out the answer
here but both of these pluses probably
don't matter certainly this one doesn't
certainly this - doesn't matter maybe
this one doesn't matter either but the
point that she raised is exactly right
the the points that are far away from
the decision boundary and can't be used
to define the contours of that decision
boundary don't matter whether they're
plus or minus that make sense yeah cool
does this remind you of anything
nearest neighbors that's almost always
the answer why does it remind you of
nearest neighbors cuz only the local
points matter oh that's a good answer I
was going to have a different answer I
know my answer was what it's like K&amp;amp;N
except that you've already done the work
of figuring out which points actually
matter so you don't have to keep all of
them you can throw away some of them oh
I see so it doesn't just take the
nearest ones it actually does this
complicated quadratic program to figure
out which ones actually are going to
contribute right so it's just another
way of thinking about instance based
learning except that rather than being
completely lazy you've put a lot some
energy into figuring out which points
you could actually stand to throw away
interesting okay I think it's kind of
interesting I think it's kind of cool so
good so you got that well let me show
you one more thing Michael alright so
you got this notion of there being a
very few of the the support vectors that
you need but I want to point out
something very important about some of
the parameters in this equation so we
just got through talking about the
alphas right basically the alphas say
pay attention to this data point or not
but if you look carefully at this
equation the only place where the X's
come into play with one another is here
so Michael generally speaking given a
couple of vectors what does X I
transpose XJ actually mean it's the dot
product right and what is about product
it's like the projection of one of the
to the other right yeah and that ends up
giving you what a number yes does that
number kind of represent anything and if
you say the dot product I will climb
through the screen and kill you what
about the length of the projection right
and what does that kind of represent for
you well I guess in particular if the
X's are well if there are thuggin to
each other then it's going to be zero
but if they kind of point in the same
direction they're going to be it's going
to be a large value if they point in
opposite directions it's going to be a
negative value so it's sort of kind of
indicating how much they're pointing in
the same direction so I guess it could
be a measure of their similarity right I
think that is that is exactly right this
is kind of a notion of similarity so if
you look at this equation what it
basically says find all pairs of points
figure out which ones matter for
defining your decision boundary and then
think about how they relate to one
another in terms of their output labels
with respect to how similar they are to
one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
