terms of the atomic elements out of
which connectors are built the base
element is called in the meta paper
ducks as in air conditioning ducts okay
these this is the channel has no
associated behavior with it it could for
example be some kind of internet
connection or it could be all on one
machine in terms of the underlying
electronics I could be provided by the
programming language implementation for
example in a virtual machine it could be
the operating system through some kind
of system call okay or it could be inter
machine communication for example with
sockets ducts provide the mechanisms for
transmitting the data and it could also
be control information among the
components connectors go beyond ducks by
providing the protocol used by the Ducks
for doing that communication that is the
sequence of interactions in addition to
ducks connectors may include internal
mechanisms for example some storage like
like would be used for buffers or
computation computational elements such
as might be involved if you if the if
the connector were fighting some kind of
translation capability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
