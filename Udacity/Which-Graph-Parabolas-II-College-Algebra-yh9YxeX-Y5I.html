might surprise you in particular this
equation y equals x squared plus 2xy
plus one does not graph a parabola even
though there is an x squared term
there's also this term 2xy looking back
at the general form we don't see any
terms here that have both x and y in the
multiplied together so this does not fit
the bill will see this graph in just a
second and of course you'll recognize
this graph as a straight line this is
linear think to yourself what the slope
is and what the y coordinate of the
y-intercept is this last answer may also
have been a little bit tricky for you I
know that right now this doesn't look at
all like this general form the equation
of a parabola but if we distributed
multiplication by what's in this first
set of parentheses to us in the second
one we get something pretty interesting
in fact let's look at the graphs for all
four of these right now so here are the
graphs for all four of the equations we
just looked at this funny red curve
which has a big break in the middle is
the graph with corresponds to the
equation that we've never seen anything
like before y equals x squared plus 2xy
plus one how funny that this isn't even
in one piece this is called a hyperbola
we're not really going to deal with that
much but it's important to recognize
that having a term like XY makes an
equation no longer equation of a
parabola the solitary straight line is
of course y equals 5x plus 7 the yellow
curve is the parabola y equals 3x
squared plus 2x and this last curve left
is big blue arc is y equals negative 18
X minus 4 times X minus 24 because if we
multiplied out all of the terms inside
here we'd end up with a term with an x
squared in it as the only term of degree
2 and it does indeed graph a parabola</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
