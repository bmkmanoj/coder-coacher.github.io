reverse a list and any elements that are
lists within that list you're also asked
to reverse so I'm going to label the
elements a B C and each of these
elements needs to be in reverse order so
C be a now c is itself a list which
means that c is going to have to be
reversed as well be is a list and a is
just a single element well when it's a
single element that's it we're done so a
is fine b we're going to have to reverse
and each element in B is now just an
element it's not a list so that's fine
and finally in C well it looks like
we've got a lot of work to do here
because we've got four and this list of
lists and so those need to be reversed
and four is ok but five six seven that's
another list of lists so that one needs
to be reversed and so on so we're going
to have to keep going until we get down
to looking at the elements that
themselves which are not lists and that
gives us a structure for our procedure
because we're doing the same thing over
and over again to smaller parts of the
list that really lends itself well to
using recursion and that's what we're
going to do now we're going to define
the procedure deep reverse and the first
thing we're going to check is whether we
have a list as our input we're going to
use a supplied function is list and if P
is a list then what we are going to do
is create a new list an empty list we
want to go through the elements in the
list the original list in reverse order
and in order to do that we're going to
count backwards so the last position is
the length of the list minus 1 then we
want to go length of list minus 2 minus
3 and so on all the way down to 0
and we can do that using range so for I
in range the length of the list minus
one and because rain stops one before
the second input number we have to go
2-1 because we want to end at zero and
we also want to tell it to count
backwards so we want to count in minus
one steps what do we want to do what we
just want to append each element of the
list in reverse order but we don't want
to just put the element in because
remember we've actually got to reverse
each element as well so we're going to
call the procedure again on each of the
elements of the list and then when the
loop has finished we're just going to
return the result now we haven't got a
stopping condition yet when did we stop
when we were doing the example we
stopped when we got to an element that
was not a list and so our else condition
we just returned whatever that element
is and that's our base case for the
recursion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
