strategies and we've compared them and
try to find one that was better and we
could keep doing that trying to improve
and make a strategy better and better
but what if we could make a leap instead
of incrementally coming up with a
slightly better strategy would it be
possible to leap to the best strategy
and to make it sound more mathematical
we can call it the optimal strategy can
we do that and and what would it even
mean on surface is not exactly clear now
when we did search we didn't know what
our first action was we knew we started
out in some state and we knew there were
several different states we could go to
and from there there were other states
we could go to and all we knew is that
we were trying to arrive at some goal
location but we knew if we just
specified how the domain works how you
get from one state to the next and if we
specified an algorithm that found the
best path the shortest path or the least
cost path that eventually by applying
that algorithm to that description of
the world we would arrive at the best
possible solution so maybe we can do the
same thing here even though we're
dealing with uncertainty maybe we can
still define what the world looks like
and discover the optimal solution so
when we were doing search it was always
sort of one agent doing the searching so
let's call that me and what am I looking
for am I looking for the best path or
the worst path well obviously we're
looking for the best path and we can
describe that and once we've got that
description we've got a search algorithm
now we've gone belong beyond search in
two ways most obvious is we're dealing
with probability so we've got dice or
whatever other sort of random element
there is and then in addition to that
for the pig game we introduced another
complication which is our opponent and
now this question of what each of these
three are trying to do and I want you to
tell me is our opponent trying to get
the best and that means the best score
for me or is the opponent trying to get
the worst score for me assuming were
diametrically opposed so the worst score
for me which with the best score for the
opponent or as the opponent
trying to come up with the outcome that
is average and tell me the same for the
dice it's a dice with me and trying to
get the best result for me is the dice
plotting against me and trying to get
the worst result for me or is the dice
going to average out so go ahead and
click the appropriate boxes there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
