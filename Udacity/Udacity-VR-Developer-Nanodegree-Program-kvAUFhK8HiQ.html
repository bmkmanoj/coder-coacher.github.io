reality I remember this very well you
looked at objects you went ruthless you
went further away you walked around them
and it was very clearly not like you're
looking at a video you're looking at a
picture but you were actually there a
well-designed VR experience
can make you forget the world around you
and can bring you to other places maybe
places you couldn't actually be
physically this will have so many
applications from gaming entertainment
to film education and design with unity
you can build just about anything you
can imagine the possibilities are
limitless in a reasonable amount of time
almost anyone who can use a computer can
actually get into the virtual reality
industry and start creating these
experiences the internee believes that
the world is fundamentally a better
place when we have more creators that's
why we created this nano degree program
in hands-on projects learn everything
you need to know to create amazing
things join us and become a VR developer
