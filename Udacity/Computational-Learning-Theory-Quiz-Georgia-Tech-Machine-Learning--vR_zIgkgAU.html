running into you here it is it's always
funny running into you over the
interwebs so today I have the pleasure
of telling you about computational
learning theory it's my favorite kind of
theory yes well sure how do you like
theory in general um I am happy that
there are people that do theory there we
go all right and now you're about to be
one of those people at least for the
next you know hour no no I'm not doing
through you're doing theory I'm
listening to you do theory no I'm
coaching you through it don't you
understand it's about it's about the
learning process learning about learning
fine so let's start off with a quiz no
wait so let me let me at least set the
stage as to why what you know what it is
that we're talking about today and how
it's different from what we've talked
about in the previous day so mostly what
we've been talking about up to this
point is algorithms for doing learning
all right we talked about with what
learning the machine learning field was
like and we talked about a number of
specific algorithms for building
classifiers and building regression and
there's a problem with that specifically
I have this this feeling that it's very
very necessary to always make sure you
know what problem you're solving before
you start proposing algorithms for
solving it and we haven't really nailed
down what exactly that problem is hmm
and that makes things hard it makes it
hard to know for example whether or not
one algorithm is better than another um
one our rhythm is better than another if
it works better if it works better yeah
well you know that's not wrong but I
think it's sort of not a very helpful
definition for designing better
algorithms okay so so we're going to
talk about is computational learning
theory and I want to say that it's it's
not about particular algorithms it's
it's about some other stuff but I
thought it would be helpful if we
started off by saying well what is it
that we talked about so far so one of
the things we talked about so far is
algorithms for doing for learning
classifiers so I wanted to draw a
picture of that and then I realized
maybe that would actually be kind of a
useful quiz so if you can imagine that
each of these three boxes is the output
of a classifier in a two dimensional
space so it's a two dimensional input
space we've ran a learner and what it
spits out a classifier this is how it
classifies the the regions of the space
so I used blue lines to separate the
square into regions the two dimensional
space into regions and then I
labeled each region with the minus or
plus so you could tell what the
classifier was actually doing so I
wondering if you could fill in
underneath each one what learning
algorithm was probably used to find this
classifier oh maybe you want to give it
a shot it's not it's not that important
to this lecture but I thought it might
be helpful it's just kind of sitting
this stage okay I'll give it a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
