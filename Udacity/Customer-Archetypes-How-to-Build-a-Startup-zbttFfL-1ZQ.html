grow but this get keep and grow actually
refers to human beings not just random
ideas and one of the things we need to
understand is what's the archetype or
the persona of our customers that were
actually wanting to get and so one of
the things that's kind of hard for
startups is to realize that getting
customers isn't some abstract idea you
really need to understand who your
customers are and this is not just
thinking about selling to consumers even
in corporations there are human beings
with titles that you need to figure out
almost the same things as you would in a
consumer company and so what you need to
understand what are the roles of these
individuals you're trying to sell to who
are they if it's an ax company what's
their position what's their title what's
their organization and by the way not
just on the org chart how do they get
influenced or who do they influence and
if there are actually buyers how do they
buy I mean how do they hear about
products how they know about you and as
we'll see later one of the interesting
things is there are some customers that
are users like in Google there are
people who use search but there are
people who are payers we're actually a
whole different customer segment so you
need to understand these people this
archetype of them trying to define other
users of the payers of a regulators are
they somewhere else in the buying
process and what you really are trying
to understand if you remember from the
value proposition and customer segment
lectures is you're trying to understand
what pain is being solved for them and
what gain is your product creating for
them and at the core is you're trying to
derive an archetype of who they are and
so what we tend to do is suggest there
are startups that you literally start
with a series of hypotheses and you get
out of the building and in your customer
discovery process you're gonna start
refining archetypes turns out that most
companies are selling to multiple
archetypes if you have two or three
don't worry that's probably fine if you
have 20 it means you voted none of the
above and you really need to refine it
more but then we suggest that companies
actually pick a representative picture
of who that persona is who the person
would most represent that archetype put
together a poster post it on the wall of
your engineering department and say
here's Who
you are building the product for its
Dave he might be young urban
professional 21 to 30 lives in large
cities lies x4y or it could be Sally
Midwest mother of 45 to 55 in the
Midwest of the United States or someone
in India or China doesn't matter what
you need to do is have an opinion based
on some fact that gets refined that
helps you understand these are the
people we're trying to acquire and don't
angst about your first hypothesis but
understand the whole goal of customer
discovery is to continually to refine
these are the people we think are most
likely to buy in the early stages of our
company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
