coordinate plane as a function and the
functions curve should only intersect
that line one or fewer times let's
pretend for a second this pencil is a
vertical line now saying that a
functions curve should intersect this
vertical line one or fewer times is
exactly the same as saying that each
x-value should only have one y value
associated with it remember that just
like line a over here and like this
pencil now any vertical line has an
equation that can be written in the form
x equals some number 4 in the case of
wine eight right here that means that
every single point along this line will
have the same x coordinate that also
means that if another curve intersects a
given vertical line at more than one
spot then there's more than one point on
that curve that has the x-coordinate of
the vertical line so maybe if we do
something like this a little bit messy
but you get the picture this blue curve
is not a function y is not a function
because if we move our pencil to
actually a ton of different positions
along the x axis this curve would cross
through the pencil in more than one spot
that means that for a given input a
given x coordinate you might either end
up with one y coordinate or a different
y coordinate so vertical lines and other
functions that don't pass this test over
here don't work the same way that the
candy machine does if we had a candy
machine that worked like this for
multiple values of amount of money you
put in you could end up with different
amounts of candy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
