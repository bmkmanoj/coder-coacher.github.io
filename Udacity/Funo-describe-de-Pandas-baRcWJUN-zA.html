function works using our Alam and
baseball data set say that our baseball
data was loaded into a panda's data
frame called baseball using pandas read
that CSV function like so if we call
baseball that describe what do we get
back you can see that baseball that
described returns a data frame in and of
itself for every numerical column we see
the count mean standard deviation min
25th percent 50th percent 75th percent
and maximum values we can do some quick
checking to make sure that our data
generally makes sense here lamanai D has
actually been read in as a number which
is a bit misleading we won't be doing
any arithmetic on it but we see that the
minimum birth month is 1 and the maximum
birth month is 12 as we would expect we
see that the minimum birth date is 1 and
the maximum birth date is 31 that makes
sense and we see that the mean Berthier
is actually 1928 which to me is
surprising I'd think that it would be a
little bit later investigating values
like this we can tell pretty quickly
what our data looks like and whether
there might be any significant outliers
on our data in other words are the min
or max way larger than the values
corresponding to the 25th or 75th
percentile although we won't discuss
exploratory analysis of data in depth
there's one thing that you might notice
when looking at a summary of your data
it may have a bunch of missing values
this is evidenced here by the
differences in count for our various
columns since this is a particularly
common problem let's discuss why values
may be missing and different methods we
can use to mitigate the effect of those
missing values on our analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
