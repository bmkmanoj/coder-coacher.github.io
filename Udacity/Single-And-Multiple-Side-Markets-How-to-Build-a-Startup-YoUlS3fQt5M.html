re-emphasize because we mentioned it
earlier it's the difference between
single sided markets and multi-sided
markets now single sided markets the
customer is the user and the payer
that's a single sided market there are
no separate users and there are no
separate payers you're it
congratulations you're the customer and
you're going to pay for it but in
multi-sided markets there might be users
but there also might be very separate
people who are payers and the example we
keep using is Google because everybody
around the world has probably had at one
time or another been a Google user and
when you use the Google search bar
you're one side of a multi-sided market
you're the user but you're not the payer
you're not paying for the product but in
reality you're paying implicitly because
there is another side the other side are
the people using Google Adwords to look
for keywords and in multi-sided markets
the company your startup typically cares
about acquiring a massive amount of
users and then figuring out how to
monetize those users next Google decided
to go for millions and then tens of
millions of users and then the keywords
came after now depending on your
investors this might be their strategy I
tend to prefer that we actually try to
look for who the payers are as early as
possible but this is a question you
might want to ask your investors do we
go for lots of users and then say if we
get 10 million people the revenues will
come or do we want to look at both sides
of the market at the same time again if
you're in a physical channel my
suggestion is you want to take a look at
users and payers simultaneously if you
say your business is advertising based
some of the tactics are how do you get
to 10 million monthly users how do you
become one of the top five websites and
how much do the payers actually pay now
if you wait two years to find this out
you might have gotten 10 million of the
wrong you
SURS so your job is not only to talk to
the users in a multi-sided market your
job is to get out of the building and
talk to the payers because you have a
hypothesis an important one is how much
will those payers pay for the users you
think you're collecting guess what if
you're wrong the time to know about it
is now not two years from now and it's
okay to be wrong because most startups
all you have is a series of hypotheses
and it's really easy to get caught up in
the passion that says well if we get all
these people obviously these people will
pay us lots of money but as soon as we
get out of the building that obviously
might turn into maybe not and so what we
want to do is get the facts as quickly
as we can and then iterate and pivot and
so don't worry if your assumptions were
wrong here on your revenue model you
just want to find it out before you
start burning a lot of cash and building
a lot of value prop around the wrong
model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
