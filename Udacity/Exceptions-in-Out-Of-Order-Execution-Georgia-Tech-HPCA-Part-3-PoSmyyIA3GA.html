exceptions in out of order execution
which as we said is part of what's wrong
with tomasulo's algorithm as far as
modern processors are concerned let's
look at these four instructions and how
they execute this first instruction is
going to issue in the first cycle and
let's say we just are able to issue
everything like this this instruction
will dispatch in the second cycle let us
say takes 40 cycles for a divide to
finish so it's going to write the result
in cycle 42 meanwhile this load could be
dispatched in cycle 3 and maybe
finishing let's say cycle 13 and then
this instruction is waiting for the
result of the load so it will really
dispatch in let's say cycle 14 and maybe
be done let's say in cycle 19 and then
this subtract is waiting for F 2 and F 6
so it can also be dispatched in cycle 14
and maybe finish in cycle 15 let's say
that F 6 is 0 so we get a divided by
zero error and let's say that is
detected in cycle 4 T so we're towards
the end of the divide let's say we know
that we have a divide by zero so what
should happen in this processor is the
program counter for this instruction
should be saved we should jump to an
exception Handler and then if the
exception handler comes back we should
be back to this instruction and kind of
start executing from here however what
really happens is in cycle 40 we have
already executed these instructions and
written their results this is the only
one that really hasn't been done and so
f10 hasn't been updated if we now go to
the exception Handler and then come back
this instruction will use the f0
produced by this instruction so this
instruction can now never get a correct
result anymore even if we may be fixed
f6 for example you could put something
like a very small value here just to
avoid the / 0 error this can also happen
for example if a load has a page fault
we page the page back from the disk go
back to executing the load but by that
time instructions after the load might
have executed and there is no way to
proceed so this problem of handling
exceptions precisely is what's
considered to be the major drawback of
tomasulo's algorithm
as it was implemented</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
