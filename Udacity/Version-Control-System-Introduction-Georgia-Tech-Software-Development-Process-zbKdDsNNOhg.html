control system a version control system
or VCS is a system that allows you to
manage multiple revisions of the same
unit of information for example of
documents of source files or any other
item of that sort and as the graphical
depiction shows a VCS allows multiple
actors here we have four to cooperate
and share files now let's drill into
this concept in a little more detail and
let's do that by discussing why is VCS
useful especially in the context of
software engineering and of software
development so first of all using a
version control system enforces
discipline because it manages the
process by which the control of items
passes from one person to another
another important aspect of VCS is that
it allows you for archiving versions so
you can store subsequent versions of
source control items into a VCS and not
only you can store versions you can also
maintain a lot of interesting and
important historical information about
these versions for example a VC L will
store information such as who is the
author for the specific version stored
in the system or for another example on
what day and at what time that version
was stored and a lot of other
interesting information about the
specific version of the item information
that you can then retrieve and for
example use to compare versions
obviously the fact of having a central
repository in which all these items are
stored enables collaboration so people
can more easily share data share files
share documents through the use of VCS
and I'm sure that you all had the
experience of deleting a file by mistake
or modifying a file in the wrong way or
in the most common case of changing
something in your code for instance and
breaking something and not being able to
go back to a version that was working
not remembering for example what is that
you change that broke the code in all
these cases a version control system can
be extremely useful because it will
allow you to recover from this
accidental deletions or edits and for
example to go back of yesterday's
version that was working perfectly and
also to compare for example yesterday's
version with today version and see what
is that you changed finally
control system will normally also allow
you to conserve and save this space on
both the source control client and on
the server why well for instance because
it's centralizing the management up
version so instead of having many copies
spread around you'll have only one
central point where these copies are
stored or a few points where this copies
are stored in addition a version control
system often uses efficient algorithms
to store these changes and therefore it
can keep many versions without taking up
too much space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
