resources is how are you gonna get this
startup off the ground if you're doing a
web mobile or cloud app it's actually
quite possible that you could get the
company started with your credit cards
friends and family
crowdfunding like Kickstarter local
angels that is investors who are not
professional venture capitalists but
might make some small investments again
if all you need is a laptop and Amazon
Web Services account you could be off
and running developing an app but just
keep in mind that when you actually do
the financial calculations that might be
great to actually code the app but how
you're gonna create customer
relationships and get keep and grow your
business and so financial resources
actually gets you back to thinking about
all the demand creation activities and
customer relationships and the cost of
your channel as well
so while you could get started here it's
interesting to start pre computing what
other amounts of capital I will need
later on in the lifecycle of my company
if you have something in a physical
channel or something in the enterprise
that requires millions of dollars to
start you're more than likely to
approach venture capital firms or
corporate partners so not only can you
get money from corporate partners but in
the United States there's some
government financing that's available
that particularly if you're coming from
a university the first place I would
look is for what are called SBIR or STTR
grants and they could be as large as
half a million dollars to commercialize
your company or your technology also the
Small Business Administration in the
United States offers grants to small
businesses to start their companies in
your country there might be the
equivalent government funding now once
your startup is up and running and
you're generating orders and revenue
there are some other alternatives so for
example you might be able to go to a
bank and have them finance the lease of
expensive physical equipment if you're
buying tons of computers or vehicles or
manufacturing equipment you might
actually be able to get what's called
the lease line so you don't have to pay
cash for them the second is if you
actually have purchase orders from
Smurfs but these customers don't pay for
an extended period of time 60 90 180
days you could actually take those
confirmed purchase orders to people
called factors and factors make a
business out of kind of lending you
money on that purchase order at a
discount and so if you need cash
factoring is a normal part of financing
in certain industries and segments and
then finally if you are buying expensive
components typically Hardware in
building your system the vendor clearly
wants to sell that equipment to you but
you might not have that cash a front or
cash is more important than your mother
right now and your startup and so you're
trying to conserve it
you sometimes can actually get the
vendor to finance or defer or loan you
the money to buy their own equipment and
that's another way to kind of preserve
your financial resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
