another computer the other party might
not have to linthicum figured since your
colleague needs to run the bill to work
with the site anyway why not have to
build run the lender and complain when
something goes wrong install the galt es
lint package and required any head of
your gulp file turns out the basic
example on the Gulf yes Linda readme
works well for us terms just going to
copy it and paste it into my gulp file
as you'll notice this task looks very
familiar it has the Gulf source call but
this time fetches jas files then uses
pipes to do a few things with es lint
the first pipe execute es lint on all
files matched the second line outputs
the arrows to the council so we actually
see what happened and a third pipe
ensures that God exits with an error
code and fails without that line God
would show the errors but would proceed
with everything else now we could
execute the task manually but let's
integrate it into our default task first
add it to the second argument array
after styles so it runs right after
running gulp in a terminal then add a
new line after god watch to add a new
gulp watch this time watching the jas
files and calling lint instead of styles
the best thing is that we can later
reuse this new watcher to do even more
great things to average I guess and
there we go try resetting gulp in the
terminal and make some changes to your
jas to see linting a peon your terminal
after every save to wrap things up
there's a third almost desperate way of
forcing es lint up on your project
collaborators with a pre-commit hook you
can let everyone go crazy on your own
file systems but as soon as I want to
commit a change to the shared git
repository es lint will run error out
and not let you commit through in order
to learn more about pre-commit hooks you
should check out our source control
