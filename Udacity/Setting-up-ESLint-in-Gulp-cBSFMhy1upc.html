another computer the other party might
not have to Linthicum figured since your
colleague needs to run the bill to work
with the site anyway why not have to
build run the linter and complain when
something goes wrong
install the gaudiest lint package and
required any head of your gulp file
turns out the basic example on the gulp
es lint readme works well for us I'm
just going to copy it and paste it into
my gulp file as you'll notice this task
looks very familiar it has the gulp
source call but this time fetches j/s
files then uses pipes to do a few things
with es lint the first pipe executes es
lint on all fights matched the second
line outputs the arrows to the console
so we actually see what happened
and a third pipe ensures that God exits
with an error code and fails without
that line God would show the errors but
would proceed with everything else now
he could execute the tasks manually but
let's integrate it into our default
tasks first added to the second argument
array after Styles so it runs right
after running gulp in a terminal then at
a new line after God watched to add a
new gulp what this time watching the Jas
files and calling lint instead of styles
the best thing is that we can later
reuse this new watcher to do even more
great things to enjoy yes and there we
go try resetting gulp in the terminal
and make some changes to your Jas to see
linting appear in your terminal after
every save to wrap things up there's a
third almost desperate way of forcing es
lint upon your project collaborators
with a pre-commit hook you can let
everyone go crazy on your own file
systems but as soon as i want to commit
a change to the shared git repository
yes lint will run error out and not let
to commit through in order to learn more
about pre-commit hooks you should check
out our source control Udacity course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
