is that there are actually a ton of
different ways you can do it I simply
want to give you one method that you can
use that's pretty reliable for creating
different fraction slots in ordered
pairs so for our first point three
quarters common negative one-half you
could of course use this method that I
show you two up here but you could also
just enter this from left to right and
it should turn out just like this so for
some ordered pairs of volume fractions
things aren't really that complicated
however this one right here is a pretty
difficult one I think if you try for
example to enter everything in here from
left to right here's what you'll end up
with your open parentheses and then a 1
comma 2 as the denominator over 7 that's
definitely not what we want so here I
think it's easiest if you first enter
the fraction 2 / 7 then go backwards and
write the one in the comma negative 1
over 8 comma 3 is another one that's
pretty simple to enter you can also do
this from left to right or you can use
the method of inserting fraction slots
where you need them first so the moral
of the story is when you're typing
things using math quill you always need
to be super careful to check what you're
typing and make sure that it's actually
what you want to be typing also the more
practice the better so just keep trying
things like this out any chance you get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
