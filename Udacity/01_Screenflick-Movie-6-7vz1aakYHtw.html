aria modifies the semantic information
of an element on the page re attributes
can be used in a number of ways to
augment the existing ways we can express
semantics in HTML firstly as we saw with
the checkbox example area can add
semantics to an element when no native
semantics exist such as a div element
which explicitly and deliberately has no
native semantics are AR can also modify
existing element semantics within
certain bounds for example I might use a
button element to implement an on/off
switch type of control I can add an aria
role of switch to the button to more
accurately express its semantics one
quick note that switch rule is part of
the forthcoming aria one point once back
so as I'm recording this it's not quite
ready for prime time yet just like all
web standards aria is moving and
evolving to keep up with new UI patterns
Aria can express semantic UI patterns
which don't exist in HTML this is where
area really comes into its own the
checkbox example is really reinventing
the wheel it's probably more work to
create a fully accessible custom
checkbox then to add custom styling to a
native checkbox but in many cases area
allows us to create accessible widgets
which would not be possible using plain
HTML this example shows a tree widget
which we can hypothetically create for
navigating this course we can take an
unordered list and add Aria roles of
tree tree item and group and add
aria-expanded attributes to express the
semantics of this widget ra can add
extra label and description text which
is only exposed to assistive technology
ap is for example if I have an image
only button which doesn't use an actual
image that I could put alt text on I can
use Aria to provide an accessible label
for that button Aria can also express
semantic relationships between elements
which go beyond standard Dom
parent-child and sibling relationships
one example of a more complex
relationship is something like this
controls that in this case we have a
button which controls whether a
particular part of the page is visible
or hidden in the form of a disclosure
widget and Aria can make parts of the
page live that is inform assistive
technology right away when they change
in this case we have an alert which a
screen reader might choose to
immediately speak to the user
interrupting whatever else they're doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
