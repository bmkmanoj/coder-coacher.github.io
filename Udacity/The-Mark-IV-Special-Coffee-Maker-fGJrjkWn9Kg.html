coffeemaker we're going to assume that
it's part of a series of coffee makers
it's the current one but won't be long
before the mark 5 is coming out so we
have to be concerned with you know the
whole family of coffee makers and how
things are going to change in the future
the mark 4 makes up to 12 cups of coffee
at a time there's a there's a filter
that has to be filled with coffee
grounds and it has to be the filter has
to be slid into its receptacle the user
then supplies some some water into the
water strainer and presses the brew
button the water is heated until it's
boiling that the pressure of the
evolving system forces the water to be
sprayed over the coffee grounds and
coffee drips through the filter your
standard standard coffee maker the pot
is kept warm for extended periods by a
warmer plate which only turns on if
there is coffee in the pot you don't
want that baking in those grounds and
being unable to wash them out it in the
future if the pot is removed from the
warmer plate while water is being
sprayed over the grounds the flow of
water is stopped so the brewed coffee
does not spill on the warmer plate those
are our very high-level description of
what the mark 4 is supposed to be able
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
