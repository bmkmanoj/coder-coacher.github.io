Java plugin all you need to do is place
your tests in the source test Java
folder you can of course change the
location of your test code by
configuring the test source set the only
thing we have to manually configure is
our test dependencies in this example
we're using j-unit as our testing
framework so we have to add a j-unit
dependency to the test compile
configuration running our tests is easy
just run the test task you'll notice
Gradle has to perform a bunch of other
tasks before it can actually run our
tests it has to compile our Java source
and then compile our test source and
finally it can run the tests in this
case the build was successful indicating
that all of our tests passed Gradle also
provides detailed reports on our test
execution these reports are placed in
the build reports directory let's take a
look at one of these reports in this
case you can see we have one test and
that the test was successful of course
in a real project you'd have many tests
now I've gone and edited our tasks so
it'll fail let's see what happens when
we run the test this time who know our
build failed let's see one wrong
execution failed four task test there
were failing tests alright we expected
that let's check out the report looking
at the report tells us we ran one tests
and that it failed and we can even look
at our test class to see the full stack
trace of what went wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
