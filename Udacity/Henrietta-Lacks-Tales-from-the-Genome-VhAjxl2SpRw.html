had a hand in changing medical biology
and genetics for the better
even today I'm gonna share with you a
short version of the story of Henrietta
Lacks but the longer version is
documented in detail and Rebecca Skloot
2010 book The Immortal Life of Henrietta
Lacks in 1951 Henrietta was unknowingly
suffering from cervical cancer after
admission and treatment at the only
hospital in proximity that would admit
black patients Johns Hopkins Hospital
two samples of Henrietta cervix tissue
were removed including a cancerous
portion without her permission although
Henrietta died on October 4th 1951 due
to her metastasized cancer the cells
from the tissue biopsy from her cervix
continued to be grown in the lab to this
day known as HeLa cells he4 Henrietta
and la 4lakhs they were the first human
cells that scientists could keep growing
in the lab long enough to start actually
doing real research most human cells
would grow for a few days and then die
but HeLa cells kept growing and growing
as a result the cells were
commercialized and distributed all over
the world HeLa cells were used in the
development of the Salk vaccine for
polio HeLa cells have also been used for
cancer research age research gene
mapping and countless other amazing
medical advances and in the spring of
2013
finally the genome sequence if HeLa
cells was published for the whole world
to see in return for the outrageous
contributions of HeLa cells despite the
fact that they were taken and used
without the consent of Henrietta herself
what compensation do you think's been
provided to her family over the years
since her death do you think it there's
a multi-million dollar trust fund that's
been sent from labs and pharmaceutical
companies all over the world that used
HeLa cells for discoveries or do you
think the point one percent of all
profits from biotech companies that use
HeLa cells go to the family every year
or is there one million dollars that was
paid in a lump sum just once to the
family from the niña
or is it that $50,000 was paid to each
family member from the Johns Hopkins
Hospital where the cells were originally
isolated or do you think that there's
been no real financial compensation at
all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
