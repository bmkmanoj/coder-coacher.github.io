knowledge representation let us take an
example this is an example that we saw
in a previous lesson this is a is to B
as C is to D and we have to pick one of
the six choices at the bottom that will
go in D
how will we represent our knowledge of a
b c and the six choices at the bottom
let us begin with a and b we will try to
build semantic networks that can
represent our knowledge of a and B
inside a is a circle I'll label it X
also inside X is a diamond I'll liberate
y here is a black dot I'll leave it at Z
we can similarly label the objects and B
so inside a are three objects XY and Z
so the first thing we need to do in
order to build a semantic Network for
representing our knowledge of a is to
represent the objects so I have the
object X u object Y the object
Z standing for the circle the diamond
and the black dot now that we have
represented the objects in a we want to
represent the relationships between
these objects so I have the objects X Y
Z and we have try to represent a
relationship between them by having
links between the nodes representing the
objects this lens can be labeled so I
may say that Y is inside X because that
is a relationship in the image a
similarly I may say that Z is above why
because these above Y in the image a I
may also say that Z is above X because
these above X in image a in this way a
semantic Network representation of the
image a captures both the objects and
the relationships between the objects we
can do exactly the same thing for the
image be the objects and the
relationships Green them Y is above X
now that we have represented our
knowledge of image a and our knowledge
of image B we want to capture somehow
the knowledge of the transformation from
A to B because we're
call I use to be a C's 2d so we want to
capture the relationship between a and B
the transformation from A to B to do
that to capture the transformation from
A to B we'll start building links
between the objects and a and the
objects and B now for x and y that is
straight forward for Z well there is no
Z in B so we'll have a dummy node here
in B and we will say how we can label
the link here so that we can capture the
idea that Z doesn't occur in B so we
might say that X is unchanged because X
this circle here is the same as the
circle here Y on the other hand has
expanded it was a small diamond here and
it's a much bigger diamond there Z the
black dot has disappeared altogether so
we have we'll say it's deleted it's not
there to be at all I hope you can see
from this example how we constructed a
semantic Network for the relationship
between the images a and B there were
three parts to it the first part dealt
with the objects in a and the objects in
B the second part dealt with the
relationships between the objects in a
and the relations of the new objects in
B the third part dealt with the
relationship between the objects in a
and the relationships in the objects and
B in principle we can construct semantic
networks for much more complicated
images not just a and B here is another
example of a semantic Network for
another set of images once again we have
the objects in the relationships and
then the relation should be new objects
in the first image and that in the
second image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
