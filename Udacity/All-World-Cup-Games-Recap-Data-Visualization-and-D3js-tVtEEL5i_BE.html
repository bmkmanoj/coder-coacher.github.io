things we've covered earlier in this
lesson I would say that this is very
much an author driven narrative partly
because it's static but more importantly
I as an author decided to make the red
circles slightly larger and to represent
the home team so I've dictated what
information I wanted to draw attention
to which other information may not be as
striking and even by the simple fact of
making the home team red and every other
team matches blue as an author I've
influenced how a reader might interpret
the graphic I've presented them and then
closing I just wanted to come back to
where we started before we were live
coding we're trying to communicate our
insight and our message in the case of
this chart relating to the globalization
of the world and also capitalization of
the games in an effective manner and
again just to remind you always be aware
of biases in your data yourself and your
audience and always consider how your
audience might interpret or interact
with your visualization and I'll leave
you with one last open-ended question
have we achieved what we set out to by
communicating our message I encourage
you to think about and post your
thoughts in the forum about what works
about this visualization what could be
improved and also whether the next step
is in iteration on the scatterplot like
this or something more drastic where we
change the complete form and structure
as you take one step closer to best
communicating our message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
