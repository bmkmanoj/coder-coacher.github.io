input parameters and the very first
thing is I've set the dimension of the
matrix and the vector the length of the
path plus the number of landmarks times
two because a modeling x and y for each
of those in the same data structures I
then create a matrix for Omega and a
vector foxie give the appropriate
dimensions and subsequently I introduce
the constraint that the initial
positions have to be world size over two
with a strength value of one I tell that
this has no bearing on on the final
solutions because it's the only absolute
constraint but you can see I add one
over here in the main diagonal one for X
and one for y and I now add the same
over here it's important to understand
how I've set up the data structure
there's our positions
let me just for a second call them s and
these are landmarks each of those have
an X component and a right component so
I'm doing is I'm taking this matrix and
I'm setting it up not by a matrix of
path length path number of landmarks but
each of those becomes a two by two
matrix where I explicitly retain the X
and the y value so the dimension here is
two times in the path length plus number
landmarks and the two is the result of
modeling x and y XY XY XY that's really
important for my solution you might
attend this differently you might have
said I'm going to build one matrix for X
and one matrix for Y and then each of
those becomes just a single value which
is closest to the way we discussed it in
class and it's fine in this case in
general it has disadvantages in that it
cannot correlate x and y's so for real
robot has view of or tations this
doesn't work my solution is better but
for this specific example this would
have been perfectly fine coming back to
my example I know process the data I go
through all the data items and my path
in X is not the data item x 2 which is
the XY thing I extract my measurements
from the data my motion from the day are
using this command over here and then I
go through all the measurements of which
they my multiple ones I find the index
in my matrix of the measurement which is
the path plus the measurement index
times two because they were x and y's
again and then the next routine just
implements the simple addition with the
measurement noise as the inverse
weighting factor so it adds one one
minus one minus one to the corresponding
elements in the sub matrix and then the
vector it adds the measurement all
divided by the strength of the noise
rival if you look at this carefully
it'll take a minute to digest it I'm
obviously using the observer variable B
to account for the effect this x and y
so B goes from 0 to 1 and these are all
the combinations you have to stare at
them to make sure they are correct but I
can promise you they actually all
correct motion is handled very much the
same way extract the motion command I
add among the main diagonal between the
two variables that are being tied
together a plus 1 then I add and the off
diagonal elements - once again you have
to stare at this very carefully to see
they're all correct and then I add the
motion itself to the vector see that's
what I had to implement I then solve as
before and return the solution and
that's exactly what's being printed out
down here I have to say we got this
correct
I'm mightily impressed you understood a
lot about mapping and you solved a
really hard programming problem I'm
responding to some of you online who
asked for challenging programming
problems this is a challenging piece of
code to write it took - me serve a
number of hours - right and I'd be
wonderful if you got it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
