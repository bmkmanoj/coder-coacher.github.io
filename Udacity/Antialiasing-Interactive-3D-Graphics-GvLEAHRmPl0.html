talk a bit about anti-aliasing by
default when we rasterize a scene we
find what's at the center of each pixel
this can give some fairly bad results as
edges of triangles will either be
considered to fully cover a pixel or not
cover it at all
the binary nature of this process causes
what's called aliasing giving a ragged
look to edges informally this problem is
called the jaggies or stair-stepping
when you see it in animation it's called
the Crawleys what we'd like to do is get
a nice smooth result where each edge
pixel is shaded proportionally to how
much of it is covered by each object
overlapping it if the pixel is mostly
covered by a triangle use more of the
triangles color less use less the hard
part is in figuring out this coverage
it's expensive to compute store and
blend triangle areas for each pixel
though maybe this will happen someday
about the same time we get personal
jetpacks in the meantime there have been
a huge number of anti-aliasing schemes
proposed for interactive 3d graphics on
one end of the spectrum is super
sampling where you simply create a
higher resolution image and then use all
these extra samples to make the final
image for example for a thousand by
thousand pixel image you might render it
at a resolution of four thousand by four
thousand now each pixel has 16 of pixels
associated with it in the high-res image
blend these together and you get a
better result this scheme is considered
a bad idea for a number of reasons one
is that it's expensive both in memory
and processing costs another is that
sampling in a little 4x4 grid is not
much help in fixing the jaggies for
nearly horizontal or nearly vertical
lines a scheme commonly supported by the
GPU is called multi sampling
anti-aliasing or MSA a the idea here is
to compute a shade for the whole
fragment once and to compute the
geometric coverage separately in
addition a different sampling pattern
than a grid is used doing so helps
nearly horizontal and vertical lines
considerably this sampling pattern does
vary depending on the hardware company
making the GPU the main costs here are
processing and storage but these costs
are considerably less and give
considerably more bang for the buck than
brute force super sampling this is
generally the form of anti-aliasing used
by default by WebGL I say generally
because there's just a toggle for
anti-aliasing on or off and it's not
specified what form of anti-aliasing is
used to turn anti-aliasing on in three
consists of setting a single boolean
parameter called anti-alias I should
note that turning this on doesn't
necessarily do anything it depends on
whether the GPU supports anti-aliasing
most should and whether the browser
decides to allow it sometimes there are
bugs that make it safer to keep
anti-aliasing off sadly most of the
video lessons we've made showing three
j/s demos do not have anti-aliasing on
just because of such a bug welcome to
the bleeding edge of technology
no one said there'd be cake another
class of algorithms for anti-aliasing
perform filtering on the image this is a
relatively new class of techniques the
first of these called morphological
anti-aliasing or MLA a was developed in
2009 the idea is to use the existing
image and possibly other data to detect
sharp edges when these are found try to
smooth just these edges by using nearby
pixels amazingly such techniques work
pretty well though can fail on thin
lines text and other special cases one
of the most popular fitting techniques
is called FX egg a which needs just the
image itself to operate I've used it
myself in products and it's even
included in three J s I think part of
the popularity is that the author
Timothy lottie's put a serious amount of
effort into both making this shader run
on just about every GPU known to
humankind and thoroughly documenting the
code itself just to spell it out in case
you didn't get the hint please do
document your code especially if you
plan on having anyone else see it which
of course anyone can do if you're using
WebGL or 3GS so I'll say it again
document your code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
