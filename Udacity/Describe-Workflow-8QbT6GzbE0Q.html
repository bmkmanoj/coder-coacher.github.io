services like this there are a number of
events that happen in the app lifecycle
in addition to the usual activity
lifecycle events let's take a look at
the entire set of events one by one and
specify what we need to do in each first
of course is the uncreate method we've
implemented this already and this is
called when our activity is created in
this we set up the Google API client and
we tell it to use location services and
the location of the callbacks to call
when stuff happens on the clients one
Sun create has done its thing the app
will start running and because we're
using asynchronous call backs on the
Google API client more functions are
going to fire while the client is
running so immediately after uncreate
Android calls the onstart activity and
in this we will tell the Google API
client again to start connecting to
location services depending on the
relationship between the client and the
location services one of three things
will happen if it connects successfully
the unconnected callback will fire we'll
look at this in a moment if it fails the
on connection failed will fire if it was
previously connected but something has
gone wrong with the connection causing
it to suspend then the unconnected
suspended will fire you need to
implement all three of these functions
or your app won't compile so be sure at
the very least to put a logging line in
the ones that you don't want to write
detailed code for yet for example the on
connection failed and the on connection
suspended now let's look at unconnected
in this method will create a new
location request object will set its
priority will set its interval and then
we'll start requesting updates from
location services we'll see what that
code looks like in a moment now when the
location services see a new location for
the device
they will then give a call back to
unlock a shin changed and this will give
you a location object this object you
can parse for details about the location
such as the latitude and longitude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
