displayed using a feature called high
contrast mode high contrast mode allows
a user to invert foreground and
background colors which may help the
text stand out a lot better for someone
with a low vision impairment high
contrast mode can make it much easier to
navigate the content of a page now
there's a few ways to get high contrast
setup on your machine operating systems
like Mac OS X and Windows offer high
contrast modes that can be enabled for
everything at the system level here's an
example of the high contrast controls
from the Mac accessibility system
preferences I can go in and I can turn
on invert colors increase contrast and
there's also a slider so I can fine-tune
the amount of contrast I would like to
have similarly users can install an
extension like the chrome high contrast
extension to only enable high contrast
in that specific app now a useful
exercise is to turn on high contrast
settings and verify that all of your UI
is still visible for example this
navigation bar uses a very subtle
background color to indicate which item
is currently selected if I view it using
Chrome's high contrast extension that
background color pretty much completely
disappears and with it goes my
understanding of which page is currently
active similarly if we check out our
form example from the previous lesson
that red underline on the invalid phone
number field is now showing up as sort
of a bright bluish green color
thankfully we added a message down there
to tell us what's wrong with the field
now if you're meeting the contrast
ratios we covered in the previous
lessons you should be okay when it comes
to supporting high contrast users but
for added peace of mind consider
installing the chrome high contrast
extension and giving your page a
once-over
just a double check that everything
works as expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
