device responds to these events to model
this we need to understand what those
events are for the next step in the
state chart modeling process we will
look at how to determine for each of the
external controls what stimuli are
events they can provide to the device
using the use cases we have developed
earlier why don't you begin to make a
list of the user actions that might
generate events that we would expect the
radio to respond to and as a hint go
back and look at the picture and use it
to find each of the ways the user can
affect its behavior okay so the first is
that the user can switch the mode button
and that's going to feel like that's
going to change our state machine based
on you know you have to look at what
mode we're coming out of to determine
what mode we're going into so what what
is the event what is it what is it that
the user does it's just clicking that
that's that little knob sliding sliding
the thing and there's really two events
here this one is pushing it to the right
and one is pushing it to the left okay
okay and as a programmer if you were
eventually doing an implementation for
this thing you'd have to deal with both
of those and you want to deal with them
separately right you have to know now we
could model those as two separate events
or we could model them as one event may
be called slide and have a parameter to
it that says left or right what else
okay so we can also turn our tuning dial
okay and here again we might want to
have a parameter which indicates you
know the rotational angle or something
that indicates you know the information
that is being communicated from the dial
to the system that's actually going to
change the vertical bar and the actual
tuning behavior of the of the radio
right okay another one is flipping our
switch for the am or FM and once again
that's a left right thing okay I guess
is it not toggle though it seems like
since we just have two options kind of
like toggling between do we need a well
this particular clock radio that I'm
that I'm not
you know this on that the picture is
there is a slide switch left and right
okay and then I have pressing the snooze
button but I felt like it might need to
be split because you could press the
snooze button while it's beeping like
kind of the intended use case for that
but you could also press the snooze
button when it's just sitting there on
accident or something or you just okay
so let's think about this a second this
far as the user is concerned the event
is pressing the button okay okay what's
in the users head is irrelevant here
okay at least as far as our initial
approximation of things certainly we
want to consider the possibility of what
it means if the user presses the snooze
button when the alarm is not going off
and presumably our resultant statechart
who will describe for us what behavior
will happen okay and this is exactly or
this is this is one of the real reasons
we want to do this sort of thing is to
come up with insights about well I
haven't thought about that yet and I
need to take care of it we certainly
don't want the the ready to go off when
it's not playing just because we hit the
snooze button what else you have so for
this is kind of like a three parts to
this but when you press the the wake
button and then press either the hour or
minute button and then that's going to
affect you know so is that one event or
two I think the first event there's one
event of pressing the wake button
because that's going to affect our
different systems like it displays is
now going to have to display our wake
time so they're like that's a separate
event and then there's like a conjoined
event when you press the wake button and
then you press either the hour or the
minute buttons now you're going to be
adjusting the display time so that's you
have like switching modes from your
display to wake for instance and then
you have this this separate case for
actually changing the time okay so we
want to be clear about this because this
is one of the
different ways that state chart modeling
forces us to think about things as far
as the user events are concerned they're
separate okay so there's an event of
pressing that wake button okay and
releasing that wake button says another
event here is release right right so
pressing the wake button and then
there's a separate thing going on
pressing the hour button the order in
which those happen is very important if
you press the hour button and first it's
going to change the time of day right
okay if you press the wake button first
its then press the hour button it's
going to change when you wake up so it's
important that the state charts that we
end up with reflects that difference
because it the user intends them to be
used used differently the event is
depressing the wake button the event is
releasing the weight but another event
is pressing the hour button and pressing
the mitten but minute button and our our
machine as we eventually refine it to
deal with all these contingencies had
better behave in an expected way as far
as all of the percepts when in all of
those possibilities all those possible
situations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
