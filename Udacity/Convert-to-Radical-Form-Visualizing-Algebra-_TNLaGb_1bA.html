power divided by root so this first one
will be the cubed root of R squared we
have R squared here since the power is
too and we take the third root since our
denominator is 3 for our second example
we take the third root of 4x we don't
need to write this exponent of 1 in here
since anything raised to the first power
is the same expression for X to the 1
really equals 4x for this third one we
also have power divided by root so we
take the third root of this expression
raised to the fourth power you might
have distributed this fourth power to
each of the factors inside of our
radical and you would wind up with this
radical either one is correct it turns
out that we can simplify this radical
but we won't get into that yet we'll
learn that in the next lesson the other
way you could have written the answer is
like this you could have taken the cubed
root of 5 a B squared C and then raised
that quantity to the fourth power we can
take the route first and then raise the
results of the fourth power or we can
raise this expression to the fourth
power and then take the third root this
is true because the exponent of 4 and
the exponent of 1 third had the same
priority in the order of operations our
route really represents a type of
exponent so we could do either exponent
first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
