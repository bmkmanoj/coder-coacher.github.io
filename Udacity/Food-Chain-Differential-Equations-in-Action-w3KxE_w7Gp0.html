simplistic model of a food chain it's so
simple that we're only going to consider
two species of fish one is the predator
and one is its prey you're going to
model the change of either population
the predator and the prey using
differential equations in the form of
these equations right here it's up to
you to figure out however which of these
corresponds to the predator and which
one to the prey there are several other
features of the situation that must be
taken into account the prey multiplies
at a certain rate the prey is consumed
by the predator that's kind of a given
the Predators however only die of old
age and the Predators population also
multiplies depending on the amount of
prey that is present now in these
equations a b c and d are constants and
in our program over here you're going to
fill in their values in this dictionary
called base values we've already
provided you with the values
corresponding to two keys in base values
we've included the initial amount of
prey and the initial amount of the
predator population measured in tons
here however is some other important
information that you'll need to know in
order to do this problem the rate of
growth of the prey is point five per
year and the lifespan of the predator is
five years in addition we will reach an
equilibrium situation or a steady state
situation once the amount of prey
reaches five times ten to the six tons
and the amount of predator reaches one
times ten to the six tons you're going
to use this information a little bit of
logic and these equations to calculate a
b c and d once you enter a b c and d
into base values will move down to look
at this function called food chain here
you'll use the familiar forward Euler
method to calculate the future
populations of the prey and the predator
at each time step lastly you'll do a bit
of sensitivity analysis we're going to
add in a degree of uncertainty to this
problem to make it a little bit more
complex let's say that a b c and d as
well as the initial amounts of both fish
are uncertain by plus or minus ten
percent similar to your earlier quiz
you're going to create dictionaries for
the minimum and maximum values taking
this uncertainty into account and then
determine which of these six parameters
a b c and d and the two initial values
has the largest impact on the maximum
of prey again all this is very similar
to the quiz on sensitivity analysis that
you saw on the unit itself so if you're
having any trouble you might want to
review that quiz and of course you can
always come to the forums for more help
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
