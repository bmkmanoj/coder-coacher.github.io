have to talk to people about is like
when this freemium sort of makes sense
or like what is the advantage of going
with Freeman how is it different from
like other typical models and then why
is it good for like a subscription
software company the reason you approach
freemium is because the idea is like one
you approach your free users as if their
lead generation and that they're part of
your marketing side of the equation like
these people the ones who can give the
word out for on there and the most
important thing is you should be aware
of is like is the market large enough
that a small conversion of those people
using the product is enough to make the
company large so for example a bakery a
local Baker you can only serve people
within a small area their potential
market size is a lot smaller so you
can't just give the tunnel way for free
because like that conversion rate won't
make that business sustain but when you
have an Internet software company the
marginal costs of replication of
offering services is very very cheap and
the potential size of the market is huge
because it's the whole world everyone on
the internet and reforms those big
enough like all the use cases for it if
you have a software that is very niche
and that the cost of each new user or
free user is extremely high you want to
rethink maybe the mechanics of using
Freeman like it's not a one size fits
all for every company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
