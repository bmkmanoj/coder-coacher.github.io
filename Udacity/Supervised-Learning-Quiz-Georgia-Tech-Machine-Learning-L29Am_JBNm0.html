regression and gave a couple of examples
of each so now I want you to take a
moment to make certain that you
understand the difference because it's a
crucial difference for supervised
learning so here's a very short little
quiz you have three questions here and
we've divided the world up into some
input to some learning algorithm
whatever that learning algorithm is the
output that we're expecting and then a
box for you to tell us whether it's
classification or regression so the
first question the input is credit
history whatever that means the number
of loans that you have how much money
you make how many times you've defaulted
how many times you've been late the sort
of things that make up credit history
and the output of the learning algorithm
is whether you should lend money or not
so you're a bank and you're trying to
determine whether given a credit history
I should lend this person money that's
question one is that classification or
is that regression question two you take
as input a picture like the examples
that we've given before and the output
of your learning system is going to be
whether this person is of high school
age college age or grad student age the
third question is very similar the input
is again a picture and the output is a
guess of the actual age of that person
seventeen twenty four twenty three and a
half whatever so take a moment and try
to decide whether these are
classification tasks or regression tests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
