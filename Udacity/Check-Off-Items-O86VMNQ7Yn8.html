changing the firebase schema sounds good
so I give you my blessing to implement
by an done by in the end you should have
this functionality where the style
changes as seen here if the items bought
it should be crossed out and it should
say who it was bought by if it was
bought by you it should simply say
bought by you if it was bought by
another user say the user's name right
here now if the item hasn't been bought
yet you shouldn't see a strikethrough
and you should also still see this
trashcan icon which allows you to remove
the item items that have already been
bought can't be removed one final note
you should only be able to unbind item
that you've bought if cougar e says that
she bought some Jam Walter should not
either by mistake or on purpose be able
to unbind that she just bought only
kagura should be able to unbind item in
case her finger straight and she clicked
that she bought it by accident or
something else happened okay so make
sense alright well I'm sitting over the
spec right now and I'll check back in
with you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
