the internet solely by their IP address
and that is largely how the machines
address each other but IP addresses are
not very convenient for users like you
and me we much prefer to use host names
the domain name system that makes this
possible amounts to another layer of
indirection within the network layer the
host name like wwwdcom gets translated
into an IP address which is then used in
the ways we've talked about this
translation is accomplished with the
help of domain name servers sprinkled
throughout the internet suppose that I
tried to send a packet to wwwdcom from
my computer to get the most
authoritative answer my computer would
then ask the local DNS server not too
far away probably somewhere in the
comcast network this in turn would ask
the root name server where it might find
a dot-com name server which will help it
with host names ending in com having
received this response our local DNS
server would then ask this com name
server for information about Udacity com
when this IP comes back the server then
asks where it might find wwwdcom and
when it receives this answer it then
forwards it back to my computer this
should be somewhat reminiscent of how a
directory system works importantly
however higher levels in the tree are to
the right in the host name hence wwwdcom
is sort of like / columns last Udacity /
www now of course we don't actually make
all these requests every time we need to
find the IP for wwwdcom my computer will
cast the answer and so will the local
name server not necessarily for my sake
but for the sake of other clients of the
same local server who might also need an
IP for wwe.com and they would cash the
IPS for the root server and for the
dot-com server as well you can read more
about how domain names are acquired and
registered and how the servers are kept
