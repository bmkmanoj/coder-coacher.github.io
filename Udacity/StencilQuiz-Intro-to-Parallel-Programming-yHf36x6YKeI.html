been using actually illustrates another
important kind of communication pattern
called stencil stencil codes update each
element in an array using neighboring
array elements in a fixed pattern called
the stencil this is the stencil pattern
we saw before it's technically known as
a 2d von Neumann stencil let me
reiterate how this worked and this time
use color coding a little differently to
show you what's going on
so here I've color-coded the threads to
show you which one is going to be
working on which output element so I'll
choose the blue one to be writing into
this value here's where the red one's
going to write its output value here's
where the green thread will write its
output value and if you look at what's
going to happen each of these threads is
going to read from several locations in
memory surrounding the corresponding
input value and those locations are
defined by the stencil so the blue
thread will do a gather from these
threads and then the red colored thread
will do a gather from the overlapping
neighborhood and then the green thread
will do a gather from this neighborhood
and so on eventually there'll be some
other thread who's responsible for say
writing to this value and that thread is
going to go and access these values so
something you're going to notice right
away is that there's a lot of data reuse
going on many threads are accessing and
computing from the same data and
exploiting that data reuse is something
we're going to use later on when you're
working on your homework assignment
we're going to try to exploit that reuse
to speed up your homework assignment now
there are other common stencil patterns
for example you might read from all of
the neighboring elements including the
diagonal elements and that would be
called a 2d more pattern now there are
also 3d analogues of these so for my
next trick I'm going to attempt to draw
a 3d von Neumann stencil which is sort
of a kind of a cross shape and extending
in all three dimensions hopefully you
can see that from a drawing so speaking
of data reuse here's a quick quiz can
you figure out how many times a given
input element in the array will be read
when applying each of these stencils</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
