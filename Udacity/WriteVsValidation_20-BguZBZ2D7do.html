about both right rules and validate
rules you might be wondering what the
exact differences are between the two
after all they are both executed when
you try to write data to a database part
of the differences in their use
validation rules should be used to
ensure the correct structure and format
of data whereas right rules deal with
who has access to write to that data
functionally the fact that right rules
cascade down and validate rules do not
is very important right rules should be
used to map out portions of the data
structure that particular users have
access to write to whereas validate
rules should be used to deny a user with
right access if they're trying to do
something strange to the data right
rules therefore become about giving
access to someone whereas validate rules
can be used to further restrict improper
data editing for example you could use a
right rule to say that a user can alter
it items properties if they are the
owner of the list or shared on that list
but say you want to also verify that
there are some true things specific to
each property to make sure that the
property is being used correctly for
example you can validate that they
change the item only two words that
start with capital letters or you could
do something like check that the user is
shopping at a list if they want to edit
the bought property on an item and
finally another functional difference
that I've mentioned but is very good to
be again reminded of is that validate
rules are not executed with something as
deleted or removed and basically what
this means is that if you ever need to
restrict access to deleting or removing
items you need to use a right rule for
them ok hope that clears things up a
little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
