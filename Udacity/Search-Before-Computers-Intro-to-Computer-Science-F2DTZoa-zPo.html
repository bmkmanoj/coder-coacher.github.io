here people with played tablets which
have riding on but sometimes have cross
references to other playtime boys so
that's kind of the origin the lick
telegraphy you could send in a query
link to a search engine as a telegram
and get it back by post so there are a
lot of people that we're thinking about
how to use technology
to search and the search engine is based
favor here you're looking through every
word in every document that might be up
on the web it's accessible to find a
match so it's really this the same as if
you went into a library and you spent in
this case we're taking days to say sit
there go through every page of every
book looking for all the occurrences
about it of the word aardvark so
obviously that's something that's really
painful to do in the real world but
powerful computers can make that so fast
that it actually becomes a reasonable
way to search for information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
