gonna be talking about gravitational
potential energy now he talked quite a
bit about potential energy due to
gravity before but we had a few
assumptions when we had that discussion
particularly the fact that we were
dealing with small distances so up to
now we've been treating acceleration of
falling objects as a constant which we
call G and for this to be the case we
found that the force of gravity on an
object has to be equal to mg and we also
found that the potential energy due to
gravity is equal to MGH and it turns out
that this equation actually only works
well over small distances and why is
that
well we only get this equation based on
the assumption that acceleration is
constant in a less problem set however
we found that G is actually not constant
and that the force of gravity varies
depending on where you are on the earth
in particular we found that the force of
gravity more generally is actually
proportional to one over the distance
away from the center of the earth
squared so the force of gravity actually
gets weaker the further away you get
from earth and stronger the closer you
get so this assumption that G is a
constant everywhere and therefore that
the potential energy is this equation is
just not valid when we change our
altitude too much so describing the
gravitational force as mg and the
gravitational potential energy is mg H
works great over small distances
especially if we're near the surface of
the earth
but as we change our distance away from
the center of the earth G is no longer
constant and these equations no longer
become as accurate so to figure out an
equation for force and potential energy
that works at all distances let's start
by looking at this relationship we found
here that the force of gravity is
proportional to one over the distance
away from the center of the earth
squared so right now this is a
proportionality but we can always turn
proportionalities into equations by
adding a constant of proportionality so
I can turn this proportionality into
this equation over here with this
constant of proportionality which I'm
going to call big G and this big G here
is really to make sure the units work
out correctly in this problem so that we
can get a force even though we've really
got one over a distance squared all
right but this doesn't seem quite right
either we know that the force of gravity
actually depends on mass and there's no
mass in this equation yet we have to ask
whose mass does this gravitational force
depend on well it should depend
the mass of the object which I've been
calling little m and it should depend on
the mass of the earth which I'm gonna
write as M so let's add those into our
equation all right so now we've got a
slightly more complicated looking
equation but it's got all the essentials
it's got this constant of
proportionality to make sure our units
are right it's got the mass of both the
earth and the mass of the object we're
looking at and the force is proportional
to 1 over the distance between the
object and the center of the earth
squared and it turns out this equation
actually is correct and it has this very
special name it's called Newton's law of
universal gravitation it's a much more
general way of talking about the
gravitational force all throughout the
universe not just on earth - all right
so now we can describe the gravitational
force and any scales we want we don't
just have to stay close to the Earth's
surface and we don't have to deal with
small distances but what about the
gravitational potential energy more
generally well unfortunately to derive
the general potential energy formula we
need a bit of calculus so I'm just going
to give it to you it's equal to negative
G times the mass of the Earth times the
mass of the object over the distance
between the object and the center of the
earth no square this time so it looks
quite a bit like this equation but
that's not that surprising these two
equations look quite similar - let's
take it just a moment to make sure this
equation makes sense
so this equation had units of force and
to get from this equation to this
equation we've basically multiplied by a
distance to get rid of this square in
the denominator so this must have units
of Force Times distance and Force Times
distance is equivalent to units of
energy which is great because we're
dealing with potential energy so the
unit's make sense but what's the deal
with this negative sign that seems kind
of strange so to see what this negative
is doing here in the equation let's
consider two points at distances R 1 and
R 2 away from the earth so we expect the
potential energy of point 2 over here to
be greater than the potential energy of
point 1 over here we saw when we were
using MGH that as the distance away from
the Earth increased the potential energy
increased as well so we should expect
the same thing to happen here with MGH
however the distance away from the earth
was in the numerator but in this case
the distance away from the earth is in
the denominator so the behavior is
actually quite different you can imagine
that as we get further away from the
earth this value of R is going to
increase which will cause
the potential energy to decrease which
is the opposite of what we want to have
happen so we need the negative sign here
to make sure that as R gets larger the
potential energy gets larger as well and
that can only be done by having a
negative here now I know that's a rather
confusing topic so please feel free to
discuss this on the forums okay now that
we know a more general formula for
gravitational potential energy we can do
problems relating to the earth in space
and at large distances without having to
worry about the air induced by using MGH</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
