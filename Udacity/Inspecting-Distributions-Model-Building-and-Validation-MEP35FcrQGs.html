f1 + FZ r 0 + f2 again let's switch to
the ipython notebook quickly here we are
looking at two histograms of f0 + f2 the
f0 is the average submitted charge
amount shown in green and f2 is the
average Medicare allowed amount shown in
blue notice that shape of the two
histograms are quite different moreover
the value ranges for f0 + f2 are also
quite different similarly you can look
at the histogram of f0 which is again in
green and f1 which is the Medicare
payment amount given in red here also
you see a difference in shape and range
of the histograms to compare two
histograms in the same range we can
scale the variables to scale variables
we can subtract the minimum value of the
variable from each of those values of
the variables and divide by the range of
the variable which is the maximum value
minus the minimum value let's now use
this formula to scale each of our
variables andrey plot our histograms
upon running you will get something like
this it is very hard to see here so in
the next histogram we will make this
into a logarithmic scale to change the Y
scale to logarithmic we have changed log
equals 1 in the code let's run this part
of the code you should now have a
histogram that looks like this this is
the histogram of f0 + f2 plotted in a
logarithmic scale also notice the range
in the X or the horizontal axis the
range of the scaled variables are
between 0 and 1 of course be careful
such that you don't have only one data
point in which case you will get 0 for
the denominator we
the max and min values will be equal
scaling the variables makes them
computationally easier to deal with and
easier to visualize now we are going to
look at correlations between two
variables but before we do so let's look
at where we are in our questioning and
model building phase
you
so far we have inspected the various
variables of interest in the data we
have looked at the allowed amount
charged amount and the payment amounts
now we will ask the question of
correlations in asking if the variables
are correlated we can ask if the
correlation is nonlinear or if the
correlation is linear we can inspect
this by looking at a scatter diagram of
the variables let us now inspect the
scatter diagram of the two variables f1
and f2 notice that we have plotted both
the variables after scaling them once
you are done you should have a graph
that looks very much like this the
scatterplot for these two variables are
very linear what we can conclude from
that is that the paid amounts are
directly proportional to the allowed
amounts similarly we can look at the
scatter plot of f0 and f1 in this case
although we have some correlation it is
not as linear as it is between f1 and f2
we want to have a quantitative
measurement of the correlation between
two variables we have already observed
from the scatter plot of f1 and f2 that
they are linearly correlated we can
calculate what is called the Pearson's
correlation coefficient let's first
define this quantity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
