data that won't work out quite so
perfectly but you can see how k-means
clustering is still and the type of data
that I'll use in this example is uniform
points this is what uniform points look
like it's just scattered everywhere
so I wouldn't look at this and say
there's clear clusters in here that I
want to pick out but I might still want
to be able to describe that say these
points over here are all more similar to
each other than these points over there
and gay means clustering could be one
way of mathematically describing that
that fact about the data so I don't a
priori have a number of centroids that I
know I want to use here so I'll use two
seems like a reasonable number one two
and then let's see what happens in this
case a few points are going to be
reassigned move the centroids so you can
see that there's a few more little
adjustments here but in the end it
basically ends up just splitting the
data along this axis if I try this again
depending on the exact initial
conditions that I have and the exact
details of how these points are
allocated I can come up with something
that looks a little bit different so you
can see here that I ended up splitting
the data vertically rather than
horizontally and the way you should
think about this is the initial
placement of the centroids is usually
pretty random and very important and so
depending on exactly what the initial
conditions are you can get clustering in
the end that looks totally different now
this might seem like a big problem but
there is one pretty powerful way to
solve it so let's talk about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
