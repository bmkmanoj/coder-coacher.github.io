problem and one that is frequently still
used today is called diffie-hellman key
exchange it was first published by
Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in a
very famous 1976 paper it was actually
discovered a few years earlier than that
by Malcolm Williamson who was working at
the British government communication
headquarters this is the successor to
Bletchley Park it was kept classified so
Williamson didn't get credit for this
and it wasn't known that had been
discovered earlier there until quite
recently and this idea came from a paper
that diffing and Hellman published in
1976 I mentioned Shannon's paper as one
of the three most important papers in
cryptography this is one of the other
three the third one and I'm not trying
to put these three in order just
chronologically is the RSA paper that
we'll talk about a little later but this
paper really introduced the idea of
public key cryptography it didn't
provide a solution it provided a
solution to part of the problems so they
started with this introduction about
we're on the brink of a revolution in
cryptography and posed the question of
can we build cryptographic tools that
are the equivalent to written signature
there are lots of other kinds of
applications they talk about in the
paper as well as the idea of basing
crypto systems unknown hard problems or
believed to be hard problems the one
solution that isn't the paper that we're
going to talk about today is this
diffie-hellman key exchange protocol and
it's actually quite a simple protocol
it's still very widely used and it
allows two parties without any prior
agreement to be able to establish a
shared secret key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
