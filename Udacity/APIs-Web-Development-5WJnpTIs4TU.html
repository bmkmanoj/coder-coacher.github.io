api's and relying on them in the dangers
and pitfalls with that for example for
Hipmunk you parse amtrak's website and
what if they redesign that how screwed
are you sure well it's true if am
changes their website our parsing of
amtrak's website breaks and that's
basically how it goes it's not really a
big deal it's this kind of the way it
goes you know that the harder decision
you have to make there is how you want
to actually parse the website for
websites that don't have an API or
websites whose API is so bad you'd
rather just scrape the HTML you can do
it by hand i showed you some regular
expression examples in the lecture you
know those work you know that those work
if the code if the website isn't
changing very often so basically
whatever works you know parsing HTML is
really tough because HTML is often
invalid and malformed and you know all
those sorts of issues so basically
whatever works and just do what you can
yeah I think thanks break can you fix on
them and that's how it goes okay great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
