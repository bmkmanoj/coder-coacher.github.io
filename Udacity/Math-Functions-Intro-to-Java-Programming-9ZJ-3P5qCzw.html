to solve a problem and you need to use
one of the many math functions that Java
has to offer in fact there's so many
that you couldn't possibly remember them
all and we prepared a fact sheet for you
let me just go over the most important
ones let's say you need to compute a
power such as true to the tenth you
can't write that exponent neatly in Java
instead you use a function and the
syntax looks like this the function name
is POW it's in a class called math you
have to reference it as math dot pow
then you give it to the two operands the
two goes here and the ten becomes the
second one if you need to compute a
square root you use the square root
function again it's in the math class
math dot square root and whatever it
goes inside the root symbol in math
notation goes inside the parenthesis
here for absolute values there is
another function
it's called Apps and whatever you put
between the vertical bars and math
notation goes on inside here now these
kinds of functions come up often enough
that I want you to practice this a
little bit here I have a bunch of
function calls and I just like you to
tell me for each of them
what is the result if you like you can
compute it in bluej or you can just do
it in your head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
