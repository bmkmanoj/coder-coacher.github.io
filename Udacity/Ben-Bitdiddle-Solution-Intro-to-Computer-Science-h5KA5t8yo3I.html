new code that modifies our webcrawler
changes the way behaves and if so how
does it affect the runtime first let's
figure out if the new code acts the same
way or produces the same results as the
old code looking just a tad index we can
see that it changes the structure of the
index in the end we're going to get an
index that looks like this this means
that we might have the same keyword
appeared multiple times but each time it
appear it'll be with perhaps a different
URL looking at the lookup procedure
it'll go through the entire index and
every time it finds a keyword that
matches the one it's looking for it'll
pen the URL to a result list in the end
you'll get a list of all the URLs in
fact it'll be the same list you would if
you use the original add to index and
lookup procedures but now we must ask
yourself how does this new code affect
the run time the speed at which add to
index and lookup run before add to index
had to go through perhaps the entire
index looking for the entry that
correspondent to the keyword but in this
code all it has to do is depend the new
keyword in URL to the end this is faster
than searching through the index before
lookup would just go through the index
until it found the keyword corresponding
to this lookup in the previous case the
lookup would stop as soon as it found
the keyword but now lookup has to go
through the entire index no matter what
because it doesn't know how many times
the keyword appear where as before and
all it had to do was find the one
occurrence with the keyword so in the
end all things considered the behavior
is the same but add to index runs faster
and lookup will run slower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
