permissions using the chmod command but
what if you need to change a files group
or owner there are also commands that
allow you to do that
they are CH own CH o WN and change group
chgrp we'll play with this bash history
file here located in our home directory
its permissions are said so only the
owner can read and write the file this
file stores a recent history of every
command the user has typed so it's for
security reasons only that the user can
read and modify the file if you run cat
on bash history you'll see that we can
currently read this file if we change
the files group to root using this
command sudo change group root and then
the name of the file if we try to cat
this file again you'll see that we can
still read it the group has no
permissions on this file so there's
pretty much no effect our ability to
read this file right now is determined
by the owner setting not the group
setting but now if we change the owner
to root of the best history file you'll
see that we can no longer read the file
permission is denied and this is because
only the owner can read and write the
file and that owners root our current
user student would fall in the everyone
category and they have no permission at
all to read this file go ahead and
change the owner and the group back to
student on this file we were just
experimenting to show these commands and
when you might need to use them now
let's move on to the last security topic
we'll discuss firewalls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
