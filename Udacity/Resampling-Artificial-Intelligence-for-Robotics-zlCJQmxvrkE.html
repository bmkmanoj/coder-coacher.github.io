than you think but I'm going to show you
how to do it and once you've done it you
can use the exact same code for ever for
any particle fighter but let me be
precise for what resampling actually
means we are given n particles each of
which has three values and there's n of
them and they also not have weights
these are simple floats or continuous
values
let's call Big W the sum of all these
weights and let's normalize them just
for the consideration of what to do and
it's called the normalized weights alpha
so alpha 1 would be the weight 1 divided
by the normalizer W and so on all the
way to alpha N and obviously goes
without saying that the sum of all
alphas is no 1 since we normalize them
what resampling no does it puts all
these particles in the normalized
weights into a big bag and then it draws
with replacement and new particles by
picking each particle with probability
alpha so example alpha 2 might be large
so we're going to pick this one p 2
alpha theme and also be large we pick
that one alpha 4 might be really small
just by just by chance you might
actually pick it so we have P 4 over
here and then we might pick out 4 to
again so you get two versions of P 2
perhaps even three versions of P do
depending on the probabilities we have n
particles over here we do this thing n
times which is so I said with
replacement you can draw multiple copies
of the same particle and in the end
those particles they have a high
normalized weight alpha over here will
occur likely more frequently in the new
set over here that's called resampling
so to make sure you understand this let
me ask you a couple of quizzes suppose
we have 5 particles with the following
importance weights 0.6 1.2 to 2.4
one six and one point two if I in the
process of resampling randomly draw a
particle in accordance to the normalized
importance weights what is the
probability of drawing p1 p2 p4 and p5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
