last time we introduced the notion of
image motion we said how motion is
actually a construct of your head
because there's just a bunch of static
frames in your mind your brain induces
this notion of believing that there's
actual motion so the question then
becomes how do we compute that motion
and we talked about motion estimation
techniques are going to be the methods
of doing this the first one though
mentioned was feature based methods
where you detect describe and locate
features in your subsequent frames and
we've done a bunch of that in looking at
how we do the the sip stuff and
panoramas and those kinds of things but
the other methods were called direct or
dense methods and that's what we're
going to be focusing on today direct and
dense methods what they do is they
recover motion at every pixel in the
image and that gives you a dense flow
field and it's based upon what we call
the spatial temporal brightness
variations how the appearance is moving
and it's changing it can be sensitive to
appearance changes but as long as you're
getting sort of video like sequences
where you have frames sampled regularly
and frequently it works pretty well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
