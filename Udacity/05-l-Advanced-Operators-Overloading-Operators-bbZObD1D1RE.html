operators here at the top I've defined a
struck called team record that records
the number of wins and losses for a team
we'll just assume the struct is
describing the wins and losses for a
team playing American football that's in
season right now now it would be
convenient if we could add to team
records together like we would any other
basic type and that's what I'm trying to
do here but unless we write a function
that describes how to team records could
be added together the Swift compiler
won't be able to perform this operation
so to define addition we'll start with
funk and then the plus symbol then
addition takes two arguments an argument
that goes on the left side of the
addition sign and an argument that goes
on the right side both of the argument
should be team records and we want to
return a new team record after
performing what we described is the
addition of two team records so for team
records we just want to add the numbers
of wins together and the number of
losses together we can do this in one
line by returning a new instance of team
record and adding the wins and losses
from the left and right side in line
right here and now our addition works
just like a charm it takes the records
for 2013 and 2014 it adds the winds
together and it adds the losses together
you can see that outputted here now you
may be asking yourself if I had to
define the addition for team records
does that mean addition is defined for
int strings floats and other basic types
too well that's a great question and
you're right they are so when you think
about it when we defined addition here
for team records we were actually
overloading the addition operator to
work with a new type in this case team
records so we could in fact redefine how
addition works for any type like the
basic type s so I'll go ahead and do
that now for demonstration purposes but
this would be a terrible idea in real
code so you can see now that the
addition of two Lintz gives us some
really strange results and again this is
a really really bad idea do not do this
in practice I'm going to go ahead and
get rid of this for now just so
I don't have someone yell at me later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
