relationship and the transitivity have
happened before relationship I also want
to introduce this notion of concurrent
events that is concurrent events are
events in which there is no apparent
relationship between the events so for
instance I'm showing you two loads of
the distributed system a is an event on
one node and B is an event on another
node and you can see that since a and B
are not events on the same node we
cannot apply the sequential process
condition to say that there is an
ordering between a and B and by the same
token since a is an event here B is an
event here and there is no communication
between these two guys that connects
these events in any shape or form
either directly or transitively there is
no ordering between a and B and
therefore these two events are
concurrent events not sequential events
not connected whether they happened
before relationship but they're
concurrent events or in other words we
cannot say anything about the ordering
of a and B in the distributed system so
this is the fun thing about a
distributed system is that this happened
before relationship which looks at
either events on the same process or
events across processes connected by
communication and the transitivity they
happened before relationship through the
native happened before relationships
give at best a partial order for all the
events that are happening in the system
so there is no way for us to derive a
total order by looking at the events
that are happening on the same process
or just looking at the events that are
happening on the different processes in
the distributed system and this is a
very good example why it's impossible to
get a total order for all the events
that are happening in the distributed
system because there are events that are
going to be concurrent that's the nature
of the game that these processors are
executing asynchronously with respect to
one another and therefore the event that
is happening over here you know if I
want to look at wall clock time in one
execution of the distributed program
it's possible that a in real time have
before b-but the same program and I
executed again the second time around it
could be that this event be happened
before a and therefore these two events
are called concurrent events so
important point about this concurrent
events and it happened before
relationship is that in structuring a
distributed algorithm it's important to
recognize what events are connected by
the happened before relationship and
what events are concurrent events and
once you have an understanding of these
two concepts then you can build robust
distributed systems and robust
applications because if you have any
assumptions about the ordering of events
that are unconnected by communication
like this that can lead to an erroneous
program so one of the bane of
distributed programs is synchronization
and communication bugs and timing bugs
and this is a classic example of a
timing bug that you can have if you
mentally think that a happened before B
and that's the way you want it to happen
it may not happen because these two
events are concurrent events now that
I've introduced to you all the important
basics of events and ordering of events
in distributed system it's time for
another quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
