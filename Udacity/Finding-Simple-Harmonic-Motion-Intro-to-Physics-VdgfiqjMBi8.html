second let's convert this to an angular
frequency Omega using this equation okay
so we want angular frequency of 2 pi and
I know that Omega squared is equal to
whatever this thing is the minus
something times X and in this case Omega
squared is equal to G over L and let's
solve this for L this gives me a length
of 0.25 meters now it turns out that for
pendulum clocks actually we might want a
period of two seconds and the reason is
because let's say we had a pendulum with
a period of one second that means that
it takes one second for when I pull it
back to go over here and then all the
way back that's actually quite a bit of
motion and a period of two seconds is
actually a little bit better because
then every time the pendulum reaches one
of its extrema either all the way over
here all the way over there we know one
second has passed half of the period so
I wonder what would be the period for a
two second pendulum why don't we ask
cheered the clockmaker what he thinks
when you design a pendulum or pendulum
clock the thing that mostly influences
the period of oscillation is the length
of your pendulum if you have an ideal
pendulum fictional pendulum made out of
no materials as a mathematical piece the
pendulum of a second oscillating in a
second will have a length of about a
meter a pendulum needs is made of
materials and the road for instance is
made out of steel or brass which brings
the center of oscillation up and that's
why I need and heavy pendulum Bob
underneath the pendant to bring the
center of gravity in the pendulum down
to have your proper theoretical pendulum
length</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
