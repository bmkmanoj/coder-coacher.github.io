related to a grandparent and aunt or
uncle and a half sibling now what's the
reason behind this well let's start with
the grandparent you're fifty percent
related to each of your own parents and
that means each of your parents are
fifty percent related to each of their
parents and fifty percent of fifty
percent in this case would be
twenty-five percent so you're
twenty-five percent related to a parent
of your parent or your grandparent now
in the case of your aunt and uncle
there's something similar going on the
full sibling of your parent is related
to them fifty percent so this means your
aunt and uncle are related to your
parents fifty percent so if you're fifty
percent related to your parent and
they're fifty percent related to your
parent that's fifty percent of fifty
percent you're twenty-five percent again
in this case but the half sibling option
is a little bit trickier of course you
share fifty percent with each of your
parents and your half-siblings also
shares fifty percent with each of their
parents and you share that parent the
trick is the same fifty percent that
they give you is not the same fifty
percent that they gave your half sibling
and the reason is because a
recombination during meiosis we learned
about this in lesson five remember that
when meiosis happens and the sex cells
are created they must figure out how
they're going to pass on half the genome
and every time they do this they mix and
match the chromosome slightly
differently so that in the end a
half-sibling shares 25% with you instead
of a full fifty percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
