that the first thing the robot is going
to have to do to paint the ceiling his
climb the ladder so I'm first going to
apply the climb ladder operator that's
gonna result in the robot being on the
ladder but the state of the ladder and
the ceiling haven't changed then now
that the robot is on the ladder it'll
apply the paint ceiling operator which
results in painted ceiling being added
to the state and the dry ceiling being
negated that's good David so this is the
structure of the final plan but another
question to ask here is how my dear
robot come up with such a plan so let's
do the same thing that we had done here
earlier we're going to use goal as a
control knowledge to select an operator
so we know that we want to have the
ceiling painted so the question then
becomes of the available operators which
operator has a post condition painted
ceiling and the only operator whose post
condition is painted ceiling is the
operator paint ceiling so we select that
operator so working backwards here
painted ceiling was our goal condition
we selected paint ceiling as the
operator but this paint ceiling now has
some preconditions one of the
preconditions is on robot ladder which
is different form on robot floor in the
initial state so now the question
becomes how can we achieve the sub goal
of robot on ladder if we use that sub
goal as the control knowledge then we
want to select an operator whose post
conditions will match this sub goal and
that operator is crime ladder so now we
have black climb ladder here and the
preconditions of crime ladder match this
initial state and that is how we get to
this plan crime ladder and paint ceiling
so we were working backwards using goal
knowledge as control knowledge to select
between operators so note that we just
made a connection back to problem
reduction that we talked about right
after mains and analysis Ashok in his
description talked about the sub goal of
getting at the ladder when we talked
about problem reduction earlier we
talked about the need to break big
problems down into smaller problems but
we didn't talk exactly about how an
agent would go about doing that here we
see one way in which an agent would go
about actually identifying those sub
goals to accomplish in order to
accomplish the final goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
