is one way of seeing this is the
following the central compartment loses
temperature to the left and gains
temperature from the right if you will
the amount of gain and loss is
proportional to the difference in
temperature but to the left and to the
right the difference in temperature is
the same so we'll do as much as we gain
the temperature of the central
compartment has to stay constant of
course the same is true for the
compartment to the left you just look at
one further compartment down the road
and see that this compartment to the
left gains as much as it's going to lose
another way of seeing this behavior is
to look at the heat equation the partial
derivative of the temperature with
respect to time equals thermal
diffusivity times the second derivative
of temperature now with respect to X
this is a line of constant slope which
means we have to form the derivative of
this derivative with respect to X but
when the first derivative is constant
the derivative of this derivative is 0
this line has a slope of 0 so the right
hand side of the heat equation equals 0
which leads us to a statement that there
is no change in time in reality of
course we can never have this type of
linear gradient going on and on the
temperature must not sink below zero
Kelvin and of course in practice there's
some upper limit as well so eventually
we will see some changes to that curve
because energy accumulates downstairs
and is depleted upstairs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
