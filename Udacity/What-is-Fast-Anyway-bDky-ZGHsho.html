network key things that people often
mean when they refer to speed of a
network connection or rather low
bandwidth and high latency can both feel
like slowness this is a map of the world
well actually it's just a map of the
northern hemisphere but that's okay
it'll do for this example here are a few
places around the world here's Alice
Alice lives in California Alice clicks a
button in your web app the app performs
a query to your web server but alice is
here and your web server is over here in
Riga Latvia many hops away maybe traffic
has to go to Chicago to New York over
the ocean to London down into France bum
around in like middle of Europe for a
while eventually get to Latvia and then
your server itself consults an API
server let's back in let's say Paris and
that takes some time to respond by the
time the response gets all the way back
to Ellis it's been a few seconds so the
apps response to alice's mouse click
doesn't feel instantaneous it feels
laggy that's high latency now here's Bob
Bob's computer is from 1997 and he's
using an old dial-up modem to connect to
his ISP Bob goes to your website in his
browser shirts downloading your site's
logo which is 100 kilobytes in size over
the next 15 seconds your logo slowly
appears on Bob's screen that's low
bandwidth now one of the biggest
contributors to latency on the network
is just plain old distance a number of
hops internet signals are bound by the
speed of light and the routers that move
them around the globe take some time to
switch those signals around when you're
done with this video I suggest you go
watch Admiral grace hoppers video
entitled nanoseconds which is on YouTube
to get an idea of just how far things
can travel in those short periods of
time now depending on what your app does
and how your users use it bandwidth may
not matter much at all if you're serving
big photos or video of course it will if
you're serving mostly text and small
images your site can be fast even for
people on very low bandwidth networks
today that's less
likely to mean old modems and more
likely to mean maybe slow cell phones
which are actually not all that much
faster than dial-up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
