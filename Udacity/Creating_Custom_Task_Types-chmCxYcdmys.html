adding custom functionality to our build
script is via ad-hoc tasks we've also
seen how typed tasks make it simple to
reuse common functionality throughout
our build scripts we will now learn how
to write our own task types creating a
custom task type in Gradle is easy let's
start by defining our task class again
since Gradle scripts are simply groovy
we can define a class right in our build
script in general we will always extend
the default task class which provides a
basic element ation of the task
interface we've got class my class
extends default tasks that's all there
is to it to define a custom task type of
course since we didn't provide any
additional capability for our task it's
functionally the same as defining an
ad-hoc task and a build script we have
to somehow tell Gradle what we want our
task to do when it executes luckily
Gradle has also made this very simple to
add an action toward hack type we simply
define a method annotated with the add
task action annotation let's start by
adding an action that simply prints a
string out to the console now that we've
defined our task type and given it an
action we can create an instance of this
task type in our build script just as we
would with any other typed task let's go
ahead and add a task named hello to our
build script and declare its type as
this new hello task we've just created
so we've got our new hello task of type
hello task let's give it a try there we
go the method of the Hello task class
that we annotated with tasks action got
executed perfect we can also easily make
our tasks configurable by adding
properties to our class here we've added
a first name property which our task
action then uses remember since this is
groovy we don't need to worry about
creating getter and setter methods we've
declared a task hello name of type hello
name tasks and then we've configured the
first name property of our Hello named
task if we give this a try
ah-hey console hello to you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
