project management and keeping your code
somewhat manageable and not into a crazy
ball sure sure so so the code I've been
writing you know ask each Anna what not
actually resembles a crazy ball which is
fine when you're starting out but as
your project starts to grow yes you need
to add some more organization I
generally have a director with all of my
templates in it I have another directory
that have all my static files you know
my CSS my javascript in this class I've
given you the little bit of CSS that
we've used and then the rest of the
Python files I generally have one main
file that is my controllers basically
the URL mapping and then the functions
that both the class is that those URLs
map do with their basic handlers I try
to put all of the database stuff in
separate files you know I have so if I
have a data type for you know an ASCII
Chan we have a data type for art that
would be in its own file that has a
bunch of functions related to art if we
have I generally have a utilities file
that has you know things like generating
random strings and creating hash values
and secure values and all that stuff
that you're going to see in the next
lecture so just like it when you're
organizing any large programming project
you know pull things apart it's easy to
pull things apart into separate files
sometimes you get some weird dependency
issues with tricky imports you know one
file depends on another depends on the
same file that generally means you did
something wrong but um you kind of learn
over time how to kind of structure
things so it makes sense but yeah lots
of files is good it keeps things clean
keeps each file saying you know where to
look for things and that's a problem in
the class however you know it's I've
been working in the same file so you
kind of you can cannot all so you can
see it all in one place but if the
projects were getting much bigger than
what I was working on now I would and I
would encourage you as well to start
kind of separating things out more
Design organizing them a little bit
better okay I think that's about all the
questions we have for this time is there
anything else you want to add on at the
UM just a quick thank you to everybody
in the forums who's been helping us out
explain things I know the permalink
thing was tricky for a lot of you a lot
of that's my fault so that those of you
who figured it out or already knew what
I was getting at thank you very much for
explaining that it's been really helpful
and thank you sean for hanging out
forums and keeping things going smoothly
it's it's it's really helpful you know
it this is my first time teaching a
class so you know I'm kind of learning
along with you guys what works and what
doesn't I think we're starting to trend
in the right direction so it's been
pretty fun so far and I think you'll
enjoy unifor that was one of my
favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
