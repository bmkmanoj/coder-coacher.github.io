distinguishing between three different
cases first case time is between 0 and 4
years the output is 0 second case the
time is six years or greater the output
will be 0 point 8 the maximum
sustainable yield third case we need a
function to describe this line if the
time is between four years and six years
the slope of this line is 0 point eight
times the maximum sustainable yield
divided by this time spin six years
minus four years the slope is multiplied
by T but if you were just using this
expression this would be the result that
we get a line with intercept 0 the trick
is to subtract four years from that time
to make it work we still have this
expression still describes the line with
the right slope but if you plug in four
years this coefficient times zero and
thus the result is 0 for four years and
the resulting diagram you see how the
growth of the population softly bends
down between four and six years but we
are not overfishing the implementation
makes use of a factor to modify the
maximum harvest trade which is 0 point
eight times the maximum sustainable
yield if the time is larger than six
years we're using a factor of 1 if the
time is not larger than six years but
it's larger than four years we're using
the linear ramp and otherwise for using
a factor of zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
