a pom DP we have set of quantities that
are actually just an MDP there's a set
of actions and states and transitions
and rewards but the thing is that that
MDP that is inside the pom DP isn't
directly observable to the agent and
instead the agent has to make its
decisions based on the observations that
it makes so this Z stands for servation
x' or observables so it's a set like s
and a and then we need a some kind of
function that connects the states and
the actions and the observables or
actually just the states and observables
and that's we're gonna write that as o
which is the observation function what o
consists of is a mapping from state and
observation to the probability of
actually seeing that observation given
that it that the agent is currently in
that state s okay that makes so there's
a true MDP and what makes the MDP really
I don't know an MVP or is really the
state the the key thing has always been
what state are we in right now and what
you're saying is that with a pom DP you
never actually know what state you're in
and so you get these observables or
these observations and that's what you
see and that gives you a hint about what
state you're in but it doesn't
necessarily tell you everything so it's
a concrete example of that in the real
world well in the real world I mean I
mean in the real world the real world is
like this right so when when you're you
know I'm talking to you and some aspects
of the state of the of the world in
Atlanta are actually relevant and
important to me like whether or not you
have ice cream but I can't directly
observe that I have to infer the
presence of ice cream indirectly from
whether or not you're taunting me but
I'm always taunting you but I think I
get your point okay that's fair that
makes sense yeah I mean you could taught
me about ice cream and that's not a
perfect indicator that you actually have
ice cream it's true sometimes I just
taught you for the fun of it exactly so
what I need is some kind of observation
function I need to be able to predict
given whether or not you have ice cream
so it's a given you have ice cream
what's the probability you taunt me
which is very close to one mm-hm and
given that you don't have ice cream
what's the probability that you taunt me
and that's much lower but not zero
that's still close to one
you won't tell me about ice cream when
you don't have ice cream so much after
all so when I have ice cream you can
hear me smacking smacking Oh making them
making mouth sounds well again that's a
kind of observation so smacking is a
kind of observation that again is
indicative of but not a perfect
indicator of whether or not you've got
ice cream in your mouth okay fair enough
fair enough
alright so I think I get that okay so
palm DPD basically has an MDP inside of
it and you can't see all of it and in
particularly the parts you can't see is
s maybe tea the tea relates sna right
the tea says how given that you're in a
state and you take some action what
state you go to next but of course you
don't really know which state you were
in and you may not know what state you
ended up in because again you as the
agent have to make decisions based on
what you can see okay
fair enough great now would be a good
time for a transition to the next slide
if we knew what it was well do we even
know what slide we're in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
