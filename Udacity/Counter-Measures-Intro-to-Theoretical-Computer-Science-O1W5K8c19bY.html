that problems are hard or np-complete to
be more precise actually what I have
very often observed in practice and even
in scientific papers where the authors
did not have a solid background in
theoretical computer science is this
once a problem is shown to be
np-complete many people will just tend
to give up or come up with some well
honestly terrible algorithm that they
justify with well the problem was in
p-complete and that is why we are now
going to turn our attention to
countermeasures against NP completeness
so this unit and the following units are
you a first aid kid to help you overcome
NP completeness or at least take a bit
of the sting out of them because imagine
you find yourself in a situation like
the for computer scientists that we have
gotten to know throughout this course
like Alice Bob Carol and Dave solving
tough problems was part of their job
Alice was solving vertex cover for
telecommunications bob was working in
biotech developing new medicines
analyzing genes Carol was working in
finance designing secure investments and
Dave was working in logistics where he
had to solve the shortest tour problem
and actually there are logistics
companies who develop algorithms with
which they save millions every day and
also fuel so those problems are
practically relevant although they are
np-complete so when your company or your
boss asks you to solve an np-complete
problem what should you do should you
say I want another problem should you
make her or him take this course so that
they finally understand and be
completeness should you say it's
impossible to do that should you say
it's proven impossible or should you say
it's proven difficult but we can try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
