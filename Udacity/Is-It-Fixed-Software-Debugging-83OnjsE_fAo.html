that the test function is somewhat
elaborate it first must apply the
patches to the code then build the code
then run the test and this again and
again and again which implies that your
build facilities must be automated and
of course your version control system
should also be able to produce exact and
small differences between versions
there's even a version control system
where such a scheme is already built in
this is called yet and the command git
bisect will give you the exact change
between two versions store digit such
that the old version will not have the
failure and the new version will have
the failure so this does something very
similar to delta debugging pointing out
the culprit which has been changed such
that the failure occurs and now for quiz
assume that delta debugging gives you a
failure and you see change and you know
go and undo the change that is revert to
the previous version for these locations
as returned by delta debugging what is
the effect is it that the program builds
normally the failure no longer occurs or
is it that the problem is properly fixed
check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
