algorithm for the vertex cover problem
and let's go ahead and start off by
looking at our two approximation to the
vertex cover problem and if you remember
from before the basic algorithm for this
was while we still have edges that are
uncovered we take an uncovered edge and
then we add both endpoints to the cover
now we're going to change this around by
choosing randomly here that is we choose
a random uncovered edge and we're also
going to choose the endpoint that we add
to the cover at random so instead of
adding both we add one or the other at
random and that's how we develop a
randomized algorithm based on this two
approximation vertex cover now if we run
this on an N vertex graph which we know
has a unique minimum vertex cover of
size K my question then is how long does
the randomized algorithm run in the
worst case is the algorithm guaranteed
to finish after K iterations two K
iterations or n minus one iterations and
check whichever the three you think is
most correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
