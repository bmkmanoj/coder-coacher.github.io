one of the most efficient ones for
serial processors
this is quicksort it is a more complex
algorithm on GPUs because of the control
complexity of the algorithm so let's
recap what the quicksort algorithm does
first it chooses a pivot element of one
particular element from within its input
then it compares all of the elements in
its input to the pivot and it uses that
comparison to divide the input into
three sub arrays those that are less
than the pivot those that are equal to
the pivot and those that are greater
than the pivot and then it calls
quicksort on each of these sub arrays
and continues until the entire input is
sorted as an example let's look at a
particular array and choose that the
pivot is equal to 3 so what we're going
to do here is compare each one of these
elements to the pivot and we're going to
decide if they're equal to greater than
or less than the pivot then we'll divide
it into 3 arrays those that are less
than the pivot those that are equal to
the pivot and those that are greater
than the pivot and we'll call quicksort
on each of these arrays and do the same
thing so when we have two and one let's
say we choose two is the pivot then
we'll divide this into smaller than
pivot and equal to the pivot this
doesn't need to be recursed because it
only has a single element and let's say
we choose for is the pivot here this is
greater than the pivot this is equal to
the pivot and now we have a completely
sorted array so this is a very
challenging algorithm to implement on
the GPU the other algorithms that we've
looked at are pretty simple to describe
and they don't recurse this one is more
complex and until very recently GPUs
didn't support recursion at all indeed
the GPUs that we use in this class don't
support recursion currently so how can
we take this seemingly recursive only
algorithm and map it to the GPU using
the primitives that we've learned so I'm
bringing up this example for two reasons
the first is that you have already
learned all the pieces that you need to
implement quicksort on the GPU and the
second is to motivate the benefits of
new GPU capabilities that do natively
support recursion so we can implement
quicksort without recursion by using the
idea of segments
recall that segmented operations like
scans only operate within a single
segment operations on one segment don't
affect other segments
that sounds a little bit like recursion
and in fact it maps in a similar way for
quicksort when we begin to process the
initial array we're going to use
distributes maps and compacts to
eventually divide it into three segments
we can use segmented scans to do all the
necessary operations that we need to
make this work including distributing a
pivot across a segment for comparisons
and splitting a segment which is similar
to the way that we split on a particular
bit in radix sort
quicksort is interesting because it
shows you how useful segments can be
that they can let you mirror the same
approach you use in recursion without
actually using recursion but I got to be
perfectly honest here it's really a
challenge to implement and equally
challenging to make it fast so it's very
exciting that the newest NVIDIA GPUs
support a more flexible programming
model where kernels can actually call
can launch other kernels which makes
quick sorts recursive calls much more
straightforward we're not using this new
capability in the class the Amazon
instances where our code is running
don't have these new GPUs that support
this capability at this time but it's
really exciting and so when we get to
unit 7 we'll see exactly what it looks
like and how it applies to quicksort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
