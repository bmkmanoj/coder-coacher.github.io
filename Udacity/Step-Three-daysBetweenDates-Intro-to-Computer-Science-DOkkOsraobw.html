defining dates between dates is pretty
simple we have our while loop condition
checking of date one is before day two
and then we update the year one month
one and day one values with the next day
and we add one to the number of days so
let's try a few examples and this was
the one we worked out by hand earlier we
get one hundred fifty-five that's not
exactly correct but that's pretty close
we got one hundred fifty-six when we
tried this by hand and given that our
next day assumes all months have 30 days
it's not surprising we don't get exactly
the right answer here let's try another
example this will be a good sanity check
that our solution is still fast enough
we've got a hundred years here and we
get 36,000 days seems correct right with
our 12 months of 30 days our years 360
days long instead of the correct month
of the year let's try one more example
try to guess what will happen here
before I run it I get the answer zero
it's not really correct right those
aren't the same day it's a valid answer
in the sense that the statement of what
days between dates reduce said we could
assume that the first date is not after
the second date in this case the first
date is after the second date but it's
not a very satisfactory answer we really
don't want to get the answer 0 we could
changed the specification to say that if
the first date is after the second date
then the result is 0 but that's sort of
a strange way of looking at things what
would make more sense would be either to
give a negative result for this that's
going to make our code more complicated
we'll leave that as an exercise for you
to do after this lesson what I'm going
to advocate instead is to program
defensively if the assumptions that the
function depends on are not satisfied by
the inputs it's a lot more helpful to
raise an assertion to give a failure
rather than to continue and give a
mysterious result or behave in some
other unexpected way so I'm going to ask
you to do that yourself in a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
