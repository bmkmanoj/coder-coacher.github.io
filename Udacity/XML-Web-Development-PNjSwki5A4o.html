know how to make basic request with URL
it that's going to be you guys aren't
become very friendly with that module
but I'd like to talk a little bit now is
what we actually send over the wire
between two computers you know we could
have our servers you know in this case
we'll use the Hipmunk example we could
have our service make our request to
Amtrak and receive HTML back from them
and then we can actually you know look
into that HTML on hit like servers and
that's actually what we do but this is
suboptimal
and let me show you why you you've
written some HTML at this point you know
that it's somewhat complex it's it's not
very regular there's you know you've got
things like you know browsers are very
forgiving you can write HTML to look
something like this where you know you
have an opening form tag and you have an
opening be tagged you know to make some
text bold and then you can forget to put
the closing be tag put your closing form
tag and the browser will probably
actually render it appropriately at
least some browsers will but if you were
a computer trying to parse this you know
you're expecting a B tag they have a
closing B tag and you know all of a
sudden you can get you know lost in this
loop depending on how you want how
complicated you want to make your parser
maybe you can recover from this like
browsers do or maybe not but hTML is not
an ideal language for computer to
computer communication and it turns out
on Amtrak we actually get their HTML and
I'm gonna show you some of the some of
those heartache we have to go through to
actually parse this HTML so remember I
gave you some regular expressions during
a homework to to verify your to verify
your quiz answers to verify a username
in an email well these are a bunch of
regular expressions that we actually use
on Hipmunk to parse and tracks HTML and
as you can see this is just a wall of
text this is extremely error-prone and
you know we look you can see like we're
actually looking for you know we're
looking for a div with class
availability and you look for the span
who's idea service span you know this is
what a time looks like this is really
nutso and this is not the ideal way of
doing things in a perfect world we
wouldn't have to hit Amtrak's web page
we would instead use an api that speaks
a language more appropriate for this
task and such a language if language is
the correct word might be XML XML is was
actually invented in the late 90s for
specifically for this purpose to have a
regular way of expressing
between computer systems I can't claim
to be the biggest fan of XML but it is
fairly easy to parse and in fact you've
seen a lot of it okay so this is what
some XML might look like if you're
thinking this looks an awful lot like
HTML you are correct we have our first
line which is basically the document
type we have the same thing in HTML
remember we've been using HTML 5 so our
doctype looks something like this and
this is the first line that says what
format the rest of the document is now
the reason both HTML and XML have doc
types and this tag structure is because
they actually share a common ancestor in
sgml which was invented in the 80s now
the main difference between XML and HTML
is in XML every tag has to have a
closing tag so we've got opening results
closing results the tag formats the same
you know we've still got our less stands
and our greater vans and our and our
slashes to indicate a closing tag but we
have no void tags in XML remember in
HTML we could have the BR tag for
putting in a line break and I and I
never you know we never had a closing BR
tag that's because HTML doesn't require
you to call tags the close we have this
notion of a void tag the line break was
an example of one of those and it's just
an opening tag XML has nothing like that
now if you want a tag that has no
content in XML you could do something
like this you could include a closing
slash before you're greater than symbol
and in fact there's actually a doctype
for HTML called XHTML which is basically
says my HTML document it's actually
going to be valid XML and instead of
doing voit agz with no with no closing
slash you include the closing slash
before the greater than and you'll see
that a lot in xml so the whole point of
what I'm trying to say is that XML is
very similar to HTML but it's more
rigorous and it's similar because they
share the the same ancestor now I'm not
going to spend a whole lot more time on
you know the structure of XML because
we've spent so much time on HTML already
just keep in mind that it's similar to
HTML a little bit more consistent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
