problem is by using a concrete example
so here we have some HTML that specifies
the word Udacity with a hyperlink to our
website as you know we can use page dot
find to find the beginning of the
hyperlink if you look closely what we
have here what we want is the URL and
it's nicely founded by quotes so my hint
is going to be find the quotes I'll get
you started by showing you the location
of the starting quote now here it's
important to remember we want to start
from where the start link was otherwise
we would get quotes unrelated to the
hyperlink itself as you can see one of
the key aspects here is introducing a
new variable this is really hard to do
if you don't start using variables in
programming in general will be if you
don't really rely on using new variables
to help you solve harder and more
complex problems so once you have the
start and end quotes you need to use the
subsequence operator the colon to get
what's in between the quotes to help
solve this what I recommend doing is
using a concrete example like I have
here in printing out your results and
your variables to help you know where
you go wrong and how close you are to
getting the correct solution this is
going to be a useful programming
technique as we get later in the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
