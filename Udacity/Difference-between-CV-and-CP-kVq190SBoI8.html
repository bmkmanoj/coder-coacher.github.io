computational photography class one
question always comes up what is the
difference between these two classes and
the material covered in it there is
indeed some overlap between the classes
especially in the initial few modules
where we learn about computing with
images and extracting information from
images computation photography is really
about capturing light from a scene to
record a scene into a photograph or such
other related novel artifact that
showcases the scene image analysis is
done to support the capture and display
of a scene in novel ways some of it is
actually about building newer forms of
cameras and software's to facilitate
that process computer vision is really
about interpreting and analysis at the
scene that is what is the content of the
image of the scene who is in there what
is in the image and what is happening
needless to say there is overlap and one
can benefit from the other I also enjoy
both of them and I do work and research
and education in these both these topics
because they're about building building
intelligent systems and about actually
processing and analyzing images and
photographs I'm excited about it I look
forward to engaging with all of you on
either or both of these topics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
