review the whole process of how
scale-invariant features are computed
sifts first we want to find the
orientation compute the best orientation
for each key point region and then we
want to actually may use the method to
kind of find the key points itself and
we used a local image gradients at
selected scale and notation to describe
each key point region here is an example
of invariant local features I mean here
are two examples of the same car so here
for example this region here is matched
to this region here it's the same car
but of course we notice this patch is
exactly the same even with orientations
and all that kind of stuff and it finds
other regions left the similar this
region here is matched to this this part
here is matched well it's available here
but there's no match here because these
two are either too small or not visible
but bigger patch here again has the same
characteristics on both so one of the
biggest advantage of sift is that
basically image content is transformed
into local feature coordinates there are
invariant translation rotation scale and
other imaging parameters and therefore
allows us to take two pairs of images
with similar appearances of objects and
stuff like that and it starts finding
the features that might have seen and do
different things and that allows us to
do the matching and that becomes an
important part so let's I have these two
images first I can run the whole process
again to detect all the features here it
found all the features in these two
images this is of course the common
regions these are two images next to
each other now of course what I
basically after I have found the
features I want to match them so here
basically it finds and matches that
these are similar between these two and
once I match them I can also then
register them together and if I
registered then I can use that to align
the two images together which I'm not
actually showing I'm just basically
showing that these two features are now
matched between these two images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
