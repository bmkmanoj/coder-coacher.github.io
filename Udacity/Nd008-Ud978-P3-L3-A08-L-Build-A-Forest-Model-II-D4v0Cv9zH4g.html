what we're going to be looking for I'm
going to rock you through the main
points of this output the first thing I
look at is record number three which is
going to show us what type of forest
model was it it's a classification since
we're trying to classify this non binary
data the number of trees so how many
trees did we build in this model so that
ensemble is 500 trees worth the next
thing I look for is record number 4
which is the oob estimation of the error
rate or the out of the bag estimation
error rate as you can see this is quite
low at three point five percent and this
is that bootstrapping that I mentioned
before over an options five and six you
can see that classification our
confusion matrix which shows us how many
items were predicted correctly within
each bucket and we're there any trends
or not and overall you can see that both
the bike and the cars were predicted
quite well but the public transportation
was a lot worse at nine percent but
overall all them are under ten percent
which I would consider quite good but
again this is only off the estimation
data so we can definitely go and compare
this to then the validation results what
I see in plot number eight is the
percent error for the different number
of trees this is important because on
the x axis we have the different trees
and so as you remember we put in 500
trees into this model and as we increase
in the number of trees what does the
error occur for all of the different
options for the bike option for the car
option and the public transportation as
you can see with no trees we have very
high error rates obviously but with more
trees it definitely flatlines at a
certain point and wherever of flat lines
that's typically the most number of
trees that are actually needed but
having too many trees in our model that
are not actually necessary it's
definitely going to take the model a
little bit longer to run so we typically
want to go and remove some of these
excess or unnecessary trees in future
runs so maybe I might reduce this to two
hun
trees to be safe the last thing I'm
looking at is a variable importance plot
which is the exact same thing we saw in
the decision tree models before we're
able to see that the drive distance and
miles and the age categories are very
important in this forest model but the
marital status and gender provide no
real help in trying to predict what mode
of transportation these employees are
going to take to work and as you can see
this is based off a sign called the mean
decrease in Jeanne but overall we're not
going to go into that too much but if
you do want to there are some reading
notes that inform you what this gini
coefficient actually means but overall
the way to interpret this is the higher
the values are on the y-axis and further
over on the X values that represents
that there are more important to the
model than the ones over to the bottom
left so these two are very important
these provide a little to no importance
at all so overall with these results I'm
going to go back up to this oob
estimation of the error rate and this
confusion matrix and I see that we only
had an error rate of about 3.5 so I
think this model is pretty good but like
I mentioned before we need to try our
model out on a validation data set to
determine how well it predicts with
independent data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
