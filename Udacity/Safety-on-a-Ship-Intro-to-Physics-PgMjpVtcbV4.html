ship now let me explain the scenario to
you the bad guys have taken over the
pier as we can tell by the flag saying
bad guys they have a cannon which they
can adjust to any angle they want
between zero and 180 degrees and it can
fire cannonballs with a velocity of 56
meters per second next to the cannon
there's this flagpole and it is a known
height of 30 meters now let's say we
want to keep an eye on the bad guys make
sure we know what they're up to
well we don't want to get to within
range of their cannon we don't want to
be able to be shot by this cannon that's
not fun so what do we need to do well
first we need to calculate the range of
the cannon to figure out how far this
thing can shoot and as a hint range is
optimized when this angle is equal to 45
degrees but what then what do we do
after we've calculated the range of the
cannon well we need to keep our distance
but how do we do that how do we know our
distance well luckily enough there's
this flagpole if we look from the top of
this flagpole to the bottom we can
measure this angle beta and as long as
beta is pretty small let's say less than
10 degrees these are going to be very
close to right angles and we can do some
trigonometry now clearly if the boat is
really close to the shore this flagpole
look very big beta will be large to our
observer and if the boats very far away
beta will be small the flagpole will
look very small for far away I want to
know at what value of beta can the
cannon reach our ship now this is a
really tricky question it involves a
pretty complicated 2 dimensional motion
problem as well as some trigonometry
that we learned in the first unit if you
can put this all together and get the
correct answer I'll be very impressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
