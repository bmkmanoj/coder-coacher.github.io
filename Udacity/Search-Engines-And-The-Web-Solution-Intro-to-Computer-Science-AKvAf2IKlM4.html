clickable hyperlinks the first URL links
to higher education the second URL links
to Sebastian's Wikipedia page and the
last one is the digital life Design
Conference Wikipedia page to go over the
answers here is the HTML page that you
were given the first option is this URL
right here although it is URL it's not a
clickable link it's not encapsulated in
this prefix that was described before
the a means that this is an anchor tag
and the href means that it's a hyperlink
reference specified by the URL so this
is not the correct choice because it is
not a link that you can click on the
second choice is a URL to the Wikipedia
page in higher education it highlights
this text as a clickable link the third
option is Sebastian's runs Wikipedia
page again for the same reasons before
it's a link that you can click on the
fourth option is this quote although
it's encapsulated in quotes like the
other URLs it's not in a tag at all it's
just plain text that's displayed on the
screen the last option is a URL to the
wikipedia page on the digital life
Design Conference like the other two
URLs it is a link that you can click on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
