by saying that this is a plane and we
put a camera here a rotator camera about
a projection point we create a planar
surface or a mosaic of course this
projection plane can also be a cylinder
or a sphere which basically would have
curvatures on both sides and again by
knowing this kind of stuff we would
actually be able to then also do the
similar kinds of projections so here I'm
just rotating around a plane but as I
said I could rotate in this way capture
a cylinder which basically has this
thing and also in many instances move
the camera up and down and also
represent a sphere so in essence book
basically be able to go up and down and
this basically allows us to be able to
generate different types of panoramas
and we've looked at this kind of stuff
before this basically showcase three
different types of panoramas a planar
panorama which basically is trying to
make straight lines be straight lines of
course you notice States all the lines
are straight here but this is more of a
spherical panorama with the lines in the
middle are straight but if you look at
them the curve around pretty badly at
the edges and stuff like that and of
course a cylindrical panorama is like
this where again we can actually model
these types of things correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
