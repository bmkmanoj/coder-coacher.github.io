across the topic of learning in this
course so let us examine it a little bit
more closely we are all interested in
asking the question how do agents learn
but this question is not isolated from a
series of other questions what do agents
learn what is the source of their
learning when do they learn and why do
they learn at all for the purpose of
addressing what goal or what task now
here is the fundamental stance that
knowledge based AI takes it says that
we'll start with a theory of reasoning
that will help us address questions like
what to learn when to learn why did you
learn it and only then will we'll go to
the question of how to do the learning
so we reasoning first and then backwards
to learning this happen in production
systems when the production system
reached an impasse then it said let's
learn in order to resolve this impasse
from episodic knowledge so once again we
were trying to build a unified theory of
reasoning memory and learning where the
demands of memory and reasoning
constrain the processes of learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
