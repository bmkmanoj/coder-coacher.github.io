hat
well there could be many reasons but the
main reason is it's not differentiable
it's a discontinuous function there's no
way to take a derivative at the point
where it's discontinuous so this this
activation thing the turn to change from
activation to y hat has this big step
function jump in it right at zero so
once the activation goes positive
actually at zero it jumps up to 1 and
before that it's it's not so the
derivative is basically zero and then
that not differentiable and then zero
again so really the zero is not giving
us any direction to push in terms of how
to fix the weights and the undefined
part of course doesn't really give us
any information either so this this
algorithm doesn't really work if you try
to take the derivative through this
discontinuous function but it does kind
of you know what if we made this more
differentiable like what is it that
makes this so undifferentiated
right so you could imagine a function
that was kind of like this but then
instead of the pointy spot it kind of
smoothed out a bit like that
so kind of a softer version of a
threshold which isn't exactly a
threshold but at least it's
differentiable mm-hmm so that would kind
of force the algorithm to put its money
where its mouth is like if that really
is the reason that the problem is not
differentiable fine we'll make it
differentiable now how do you like it I
don't know how do we like it now well
I'll tell how much I like it when you
show me your function it acts like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
