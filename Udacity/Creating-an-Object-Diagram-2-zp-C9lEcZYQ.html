the process of creating an object
diagram you might also hear this process
referred to as object decomposition that
is we're taking something that's a big
object like a nap and we're breaking it
down into its individual components now
there's no right or wrong way to do this
if a hundred people create an object
diagram for a nap there might be a
hundred completely different diagrams
also there are some informal informal
ways to create them a formal way might
be creating an object diagram using the
universal modeling language or UML and
an example object diagrams given here on
the left now UML as a modeling language
contains a bunch of standard symbols and
icons that are helpful for laying out
the components of a project but for many
you mail can be really bulky to work
with and I'd fall into that category I'm
more of a fan of an informal approach
that takes some ideas from UML but it
doesn't get bogged down in the
nitty-gritty details in an example of a
more informal object diagrams given here
on the right so for this example I'm
going to take a nap that you'll see
later called alien adventure this is the
main screen for the app and I can
interact with it by tapping on the
screen and we can see that this robot
will animate across the screen and
there's an alien there's actually
multiple aliens and the robot and the
alien will have a discussion and we'll
go back and forth and if the robot
answers the aliens question correctly
then these little badges will appear in
the lower left-hand corner of the screen
I'm going to stop right here at this
point we've already seen enough of this
app to actually start the object
decomposition process I'm going to open
a google drawing to build the diagram
but you could use a piece of paper a
napkin a tool like draw io which i have
that open up in this other tab here this
is a draw i 0 diagram are really just
any tool that gives you the ability to
put your ideas into a diagram personally
I'm a big fan of napkins and I can say
from personal experience that a lot of
great ideas I've diagrammed on napkins
and I'd lean to say that there's
probably some other amazing apps out
there that have been diagrammed on
napkins but that's a different story the
first thing we'll start with is the
first big object which is the app itself
now the app is
an actual object and code but that's
okay we're going to use it as our
starting point if we think about what we
saw when we were playing around with the
app we can start adding those objects to
the diagram so we know that there's a
robot and that there were aliens so I'm
going to go ahead and make some
rectangles to represent those and we'll
add labels for the robot object and the
alien object you'll notice that I'm
using the singular form of alien and not
aliens even though there are multiple
aliens in the app if we were to continue
playing it and this is a personal
preference and it's one of those aspects
of UML that I'm blending with this
informal approach in UML you typically
refer to objects in their singular form
also if I was using a more formal
process I might use a certain type of
symbol for an object maybe a rectangle
and then a certain type of symbol for a
struck like a rounded rectangle but
again because we're keeping it pretty
informal I'm just going to use
rectangles for everything now what else
did we notice in the app what else
seemed to stand out in our mind as a
self-contained entity what else could be
considered part of the application some
of the things that I can think of are
the background we also had badges that
appeared in the lower left hand corner
and there was a dialogue bubble at the
top and it consisted of multiple lines
of text this is a pretty good set of
objects to start with these were all
things that we could clearly see with
our eyes but there could also be objects
that are behind the scenes things that
we can't see but still make up some part
of the application itself for example
what about the concept of a game world
maybe the aliens the robot and
everything within it could be thought as
parts of a game world so I'm going to go
ahead and add a symbol for world to our
object diagram an adding world here is
just another example of what I really
want to stress to you this process is
not exact science it's a very creative
abstract thinking type of process no two
people will probably create the same
object diagram now I'm going to go ahead
and stop here in just a moment we're
going to refine this diagram we're going
to think about how the objects are
interconnected and we're also going to
look to see if any of the objects have
similarities because that's a big deal
when designing apps if some of the
objects share traits and other similar
functionality then
we can take advantage of that later when
we start writing code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
