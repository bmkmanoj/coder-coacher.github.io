that illustrates several other features
of Harrell's notation once again there
are three outermost States idle
maintenance and active and the active
state itself is has nested states inside
of it there are transitions from idle to
the boundary of active to transitions
there and as we saw similarly each of
those transitions is going to go to the
default state in the internal machine
which is labeled validating another
thing to note here is that two of the
transitions in the nested machine in the
active State are labeled with text
inside of square brackets these are data
conditions they are tests logical
expressions on the the the attributes of
the object which is being represented by
this particular state machine in the
transition between processing and
printing on the right hand side of the
active state there are square brackets
and in sight it says not continue okay
continue is an attribute presumably a
boolean attribute and if it's false then
the transition can take place
otherwise it won't take place also
between processing and selecting there's
a transition labeled continue which will
take place if the continue attribute
happens to be true
the other thing to notice about this
particular example is that in the the
bottom on the left of the active state
there are two lines of text one labeled
entry and one labeled exit these are
actions that will take place upon
respectively entry and exit from the
inner inner state machine that is when a
transition from idle goes to active
before anything else happens the read
card action will be executed likewise
upon exit from the printing State
all the other work is done the eject
card action will take place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
