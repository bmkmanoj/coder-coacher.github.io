the object set up detail page so just
navigating this set my friend set up
there you go I mean the quick access
menu yep we can go right there and then
create the action ourselves cool so if
we scroll down one of these related
lists is button links and actions and so
that will allow us to create an action
that we can drag onto the page layout
and then access from chatter okay so
buttons links in actions new action i'm
guessing yep so there are a couple
different types of actions we can make
one is creating like a child record and
what's great about this if you choose
this as you can one it'll automatically
relate the child to the parent but you
can also predefine fields if you want to
do things like that okay or a couple the
other actions log a call we could use
some code if we wanted to put a
visualforce page in there or update the
record itself not necessarily a child
record but update like a state stage but
not update each other yeah but I can
create a child create a set yes okay so
that's what I wouldn't do target object
will be set time label would be what
what's called at a set time well this is
just what's gonna say on the action
exactly and then we don't need to choose
that if we choose something there it
automatically names it for us oh yeah
okay sounds good and so now this is the
mini page layout so when we have you
know a new record input form it's going
to ask us what fields from set time do
you want to show up on this form when
you're creating the child set time so
probably everything I would guess yeah
but I mean if you had an object that had
a lot of fields you always want to get
to the main fields exactly okay but we
don't have a lot of fields will do date
status in time ready your your UX skills
are impeccable all right safe yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
