required to solve the 3sat problem in
this course we've seen how to represent
three set the input that is we've also
seen how to apply pre-processing rules
so that it's a bit easier to solve after
that and these are mainly in problem
sets too and for now we're going to do
is construct a search tree to find if
the given instance has a satisfying
assignment so you're going to code up a
function solve 3sat that should return
none if the given instance of 3sat has
no satisfying assignment and otherwise
it should return that satisfying
assignment now the search tree technique
that we're going to use is as follows
when you take any clause that is not
satisfied and if all of the variables
have already been set then there's no
possible solution anymore
so simply return none otherwise we
branch into at most three cases where in
each case a different variables set so
that the clause can hopefully become
satisfied the first variable is set so
that Clause becomes satisfied and we
don't do anything with the other
variables the first variable set so that
Clause does not become satisfied and the
second one is set so that becomes
satisfied and then we don't do anything
with the third variable and finally the
first and second variables are set so
that the clause does not become
satisfied and the third one is set so
that it does become satisfied these are
the three possible cases with three sets
since there are at most three variables
in any clause now you can write any
additional functions required to solve
this problem or break this up into sub
parts and I'd recommend doing that it
should make this much simpler because it
can get to be quite a bit of code here
so have fun solving 3sat I know we've
already done a lot of the steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
