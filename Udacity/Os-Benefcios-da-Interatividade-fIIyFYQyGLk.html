important for data visualization we
think it's really important because it
lets you understand a lot more about the
actual data that's shown in a graph so
instead of not being able to see what
the actual name or object or company
that you're looking at in a graph is if
you have let's say text on the hover and
the ability to zoom and toggle you can
really explore the graph and the data
further so we actually have an example
here that shows why this works pretty
well so here we can see four degrees of
data about this graph so across the
x-axis we see per capita gdp in various
countries and across the y-axis we see
life expectancy in years for folks who
live there and we can do things like
pull this up and down we can zoom in and
check out the bubbles themselves and
what you can see here beyond the actual
x and y axis is the bubbles are sized
for the population of a country and
they're colored for the continent and so
you can see in the legend here the
different clusters based on the
continents that they're part of and so
by being able to see more than just the
normal x and y plotting you can see
things about clusters of continents for
example of like here you can see these
are mostly continents that are countries
that are in africa and then up here you
have more of a concentration of the
americas in Europe and then also by
being able to buy it being web-based we
can do things like embed live graphs or
live links into it so you can link back
to the source of it of data if you'd
like to show where it comes from we can
also show the actual data behind the
graph so anytime you make a graph you
don't have to worry about whether your
data is lost and then we can actually
show the code for it so you can see how
to remake that from different
programming languages and so the fun
thing is then once you've made that
graph you don't just have to share it at
a link here though you can you can
actually just put it in I frames and so
it you can then just put this onto a
website so other folks can also get that
same interactive experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
