the only one that thinks regular
expressions are interesting and powerful
both west swimmers 262 class and Peter
Norvig 212 class have entire units that
are focused mostly on understanding and
using regular expressions we're not
going to go into that much depth now but
i'll explain enough so you can
understand basic regular expressions
including the one that's used here so
regular expressions define sets of
strings the simplest is to just have a
single character and that represents the
set containing just one string so for
example the regular expression a defines
the set containing the single string
just a and i'm not writing my strings
with coats here or using python set
notation writing this in a more
mathematical way we can also concatenate
and if we have two regular expressions
next to each other that gives us the set
of everything we can get from are
followed by everything in s this will
make more sense when we have ours and
s's that can produce many strings if
it's just a followed by be well it can
produce just a bee can produce just be
so it gives us the set containing the
string a B we can put multiple
expressions within square braces like
this and that produces a set of strings
which is the union of all the strings
are can produce and all the strings s
can produce so in this case it's going
to be a set of two elements containing
the strings a and B we can use the
asterisks which means zero or more
occurrences of whatever precedes it so
that would mean a star is the set of
strings the empty string the string a
the string a a the string AAA and so on
ah and if we wrote that in Python it
would just be two quotes next to each
other since I'm not using the quotes
here i'll just write empty so a question
mark is the set of two strings either
empty or the string a the last thing
that I need to mention is that we can
use parenthesis for grouping so if you
put parentheses around two regular
expressions that becomes a single
expression for example if we had a B
star that would be the set of strings a
a be a BB and a boo boo boo boo boo boo
boo and so on but if we use the
parentheses
and we have a be surrounded by
parentheses star well that's going to be
the set of strings empty a b a.b a.b a.b
a.b a.b above above above and so on the
other thing parenthesis do is bind
what's in between them as variables and
so the first input to our query is
what's contained in the first set of
parentheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
