that like with games there are minimum
requirements you know you must have this
you know directx 11 or dadadada so do
you have like minimum requirements are
there sort of tears of support or how
does that work we have a minimum set of
requirements for your system and for
your graphics card but we also have a
very thorough certification process
because even if a card says that you
know it runs dx11 it has all these
effects there can be problems with a
card or a driver so we actually have to
go through card driver combinations
certifying each one run through a whole
list of effects make sure they can do
each one well and efficiently because
depending on the customer some customers
may want the visual accuracy and don't
care as much about the performance
somewhat the performance no care as much
about the visual accuracy so depending
on what is the striving for if we have
an effect that looks really good but it
is slow that will work for some
customers but not all customers we
they're also the frame rate issues that
you see particularly in games where a
game has to run a 30 Hertz or 60 Hertz
and again they'll cut some corners in
order to be able to do that we don't
have those strict requirements in CAD
although there are times when someone
has a model they need to orbit at the
knee to pan around so we do need to get
good frame rate out of that and we will
actually play some of those same tricks
where will study degrade the visuals in
order to be able to to want to see the
model moving and then when you stop we
cut off the degradation and bring back
the original model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
