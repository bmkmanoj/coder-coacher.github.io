the aspects that go into building a
practical real-world search engine and
how should you use existing tools such
as pre-existing libraries to help build
your search engine so one example he
gives in his post which has a lot of
great detail and I encourage people to
look at it it's beautiful soup which is
a Python library to parse really
complicated HTML so in our web crawler
we just parse very strict kind of string
match and it doesn't always follow that
role so beautiful suit can help with
that should we be aware of these
libraries and how should we can clear so
there's a lot of things that are more
complicated if you want to build a
robust search engine that's gonna work
on all the pages out there on the web
and initial a good list of some of the
things that you need to think about and
for the advanced students that are
wanting to go beyond what we're doing in
class it's great to start thinking about
those things and it is also the case
that you don't want to build everything
yourself in this class we're building
things ourselves because we want to
learn what's going on underneath and
build as much and understand as much
about computing as we can if you're
building real software you want to try
to start from libraries that other
people have already written that are
available for you to use and
beautifulsoup is a very useful library
for parsing HTML for doing the kinds of
things they get real complicated if you
want to find links in real HTML code
that can be much more complex than what
we're focusing on so far it's still
using the same kinds of ideas that we do
in the class but someone else has put a
lot of effort into writing that code and
making it work and it's definitely a
good idea to reuse libraries that are
available to check carefully what the
licenses on those libraries whether you
can use them on it or not but it's
definitely when you start building more
complex programs rather than starting
from scratch and writing everything
yourself trying to find a library that
will help you get what you need done
more quickly is a great idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
