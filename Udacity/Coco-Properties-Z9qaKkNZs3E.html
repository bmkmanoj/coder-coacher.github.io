perspective of cocoa values we learned a
couple things we learned that their
efficiently computable because we can do
it with a simple maximization and a
linear program add it together what we
end up getting is a behavior that
utility maximizing for the two players
and then they just they split it up
afterwards you can think of it as
actually decomposing a game into to a
sum of two games eat one of which is
purely cooperative and one is just
purely competitive we're just kind of
shifting around the utilities but we do
it in a way that leaves us with two
really nice games to work with the
result of that is unique there is a
unique cocoa value for each of the
players it's unlike an ash where there
can be multiple different possible
values depending on which Nash you pick
there's just the one cocoa value is very
convenient that is convenient because
that means there's an answer there is an
answer yeah we've discovered that in
fact you can generalize this notion not
just to matrix seems like we talked
about but actually to stochastic games
in general and we get an algorithm that
we called Coco q cocoa q is a is a queue
learning like algorithm that uses cocoa
values to learn a strategy in a
stochastic game where they actually can
make little side payments after each
move so the two players move and then
they divvy some stuff up and then they
move again and they did be some stuff up
and those the side payments actually end
up being sensitive to issues like we
just got really unlucky or I'm about to
take an action which is very risky and
so you know you're gonna have to pay me
to take that action and the the payments
have these nice interpretations in terms
of kind of paying people for taking
risky actions and giving them the
benefits of things it's neat because
this actually converges this q learning
algorithm converges in spite of the fact
that the operator the cocoa operator is
not a non-expansion we've talked about
non expansions in the context of
generalized q-learning this is a case
where that analysis actually fails but
there's a different analysis that you
can use to show that the algorithm
actually converges so that was so
surprising to me anyway it's been a lot
of time worrying about non expansions
thinking that they were the answer to
everything and they're into everything
except for things that are just not this
thing cuckoo for cocoa puffs one thing
is worth pointing out is that what you
get at the end of this is not
necessarily an equilibrium which is to
say once we've computed what the cocoa
values are I might not want to play that
game I mean I want to do the side
payment
rather get it my value in a Nash
equilibrium or something like that and
so that means that to really make this
work this side payment mechanism has to
be binding they have to agree in advance
that whatever happens we're going to do
what the cocoa value says we should do
and it's somewhat beneficial but making
this binding agreement in general is not
beneficial it could be for some players
they'd rather just not do it so it's not
it's not an equilibrium in the same
census as like Nash and correlated mmm
so we're gonna to her police officers
we're gonna have to hire police officers
to to divvy up our bananas okay just
like rule so thank you for letting me
have a chance to come in and and discuss
cocoa values which otherwise we would
have not gotten to like it so show
should I learn from this that basically
we should always be doing coke 0 values
or cocoa yeah we should always be doing
cocoa and you know herring police
officers make things by me boy I don't
know uh I mean in general you tend to
get a higher sum of values from the
cocoa value so paying the police
officers probably makes sense so it
might be worth hiring them for specific
games it's not necessarily true and it
doesn't necessarily kind of fit another
problem with the notion of cocoa values
is that it doesn't really generalize if
you've got more than two players so this
is specific to the two player setting if
you have three players you can't split
it in two I don't know three matrices
one of which is cooperative and another
which is competitive and the other which
is I don't know combustible well what if
you did a all pairwise games you had to
get extremely lucky it doesn't yeah it
doesn't doesn't seem like there's a
natural extension of this that works for
more than two players I mean it's an
open problem and so no one's shown that
you can't do it so you know that could
be a homework problem oh yeah that's
cool and then anyone who gives phd's for
everyone
wouldn't it be nice that would be nice
okay so we've gotten through Coco vices
good so we work together and now we've
done two solution concepts in some
detail yeah everybody wins that's the
thing and now we can actually do side
payments to kind of divvy up afterwards
so what are you gonna give me i'm gonna
give you back the pan so that you can
wrap up the section 30 fun game theory
sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
