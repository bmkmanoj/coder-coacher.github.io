communication patterns check that off
now that we've discussed the general
forms of communication that we'll see
among the CUDA threads and our parallel
programs let's talk about how those
threads can most efficiently access
memory and concert an important subtopic
of this is going to be how to exploit
the data reuse that we saw during all
those gathers and stencil codes there
was a lot of there were a lot of threads
often accessing the same data at the
same time and how can how can we exploit
that to reduce the total amount of time
spent on memory and the next big topic
is how can threads communicate partial
results by sharing memory a real problem
then becomes once threads are sharing
memory and reading and writing from the
same memory how you keep them from
stomping on each other's memory accesses
how can you do this safely so in order
to better understand all of these topics
we need to dive a bit deeper and learn
more about the underlying GPU hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
