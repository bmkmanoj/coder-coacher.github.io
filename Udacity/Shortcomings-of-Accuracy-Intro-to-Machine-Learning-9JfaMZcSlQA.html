accuracy is a perfectly fine metric and
a good place to start
it does have some shortcomings so let's
think about what those might be in the
case where we want to identify persons
of interest in the Enron data set so
here are a few possible shortcomings and
you check all of the ones that sound
like they could be problems in our case
the first possible problem is that maybe
accuracy is not ideal for skewed classes
so skewed class would be an example of
where you have many data points and a
few of them fall into one class and many
of them fall into the other class this
is what's going on with the Enron data
set because although there were
thousands of people who worked at Enron
there were only a few dozen who ended up
really being pursued by the law for
their involvement in in the fraud so
accuracy might not be an ideal metric in
that particular case where you have very
few examples of one of the classes
another possibility is that maybe
depending on exactly what you mean by
identifying a person of interest you
might want to err on the side of
guessing that someone is innocent when
you're in doubt that if for example as a
result of this that maybe you're your
machine learning algorithm is
identifying people who should be thrown
in jail in that case I would say you
want to be really sure that someone is
involved in the fraud before you risk
putting them in jail for a long time and
that if you have any doubt at all you
should err on the side of assuming that
they're innocent
the accuracy perhaps might be not
particularly tailored to that outcome
that you want and a third possibility
might be that accuracy isn't well
tailored to the outcome that you want
but in the other direction let's suppose
that you want kind of a broad net being
cast then all the people who are
identified as persons of interest just
means that they're gonna get a little
bit of a higher level of scrutiny and
that there might be still lots of
investigation going on and so in that
case what you would want to do is make
sure that you get as many people who
were actually involved in the fraud as
possible identified even if it comes to
the cost of identifying some people who
are probably innocent because those
innocent people will then be
investigated and cleared in later rounds
of the investigation and that accuracy
might not be the right metric if that's
the goal that you're going for in
to identify persons of interest so check
any of these boxes that you think could
be a little bit of a problem if all
you're doing is trying to maximize the
accuracy of your classifier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
