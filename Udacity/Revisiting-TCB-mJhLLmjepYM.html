ourselves is how do we know that is
certain system that claims to be a TCB
or trusted computing base is actually
can actually be trusted so trusted is
actually not the only sort of qualified
we use we call systems secure systems
trusted I've been using this word but
also I assurance systems so security is
kind of you know security is you can
think of this as a binary property in
some sense is energy either something is
secured or it's not secure when
something can go wrong and while it the
security requirements trust it is
typically certified level of confidence
that you have that it's going to do the
right thing what it is expected to do
it's level of trust trustworthiness
trusted our reliance on it and things
like that and high assurance basically
is similar sort of idea it says you know
it does what it's supposed to do with a
very high level of assurance I should
say that the hardware that we have you
know you need some place to stand on
hardware is obviously in something that
we're going to trust and software that
has direct access to the hardware which
makes up your operating system the
trusted computing base we have to trust
it and anything else that we able to
make claims about the level of trust
that we have in the system is going to
depend on the trust that we have in this
underlying trusted computing base so
enforcement of a security policy because
we implement access control in a certain
way or isolation of processes isolation
of project untrusted code from trusted
code all that is going to rely on this
level of trust that we have or the level
of assurance that we have that the
trusted computing base would do what
it's supposed to do and nothing more and
nothing less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
