do after the 101 courses have a course
on building web applications the cool
thing about web applications is instead
of just writing a program that you can
use you can write a program that you can
put on the web and then everyone in the
world can also use it I wanted to find
someone to teach the course who really
knows a lot about building web
applications and I'm delighted that we
found Steve Huffman to do that so Steve
tell us what the course is gonna be that
ok so I started reddit com as the lead
engineer about seven years ago and more
recently I started hit MOFCOM a new
travel site this course is basically
going to cover the things that I wish I
had known starting those websites seven
years ago getting into this business I
had no idea what I was doing and I
learned most of what I know now through
trial and error and many lessons learned
the hard way we're going to start with
the internet and browsers and how they
work will do form validation databases
API to integrate with other websites and
we'll touch on some scaling issues as
well so by the time you're done you'll
have a blog that's online for you to use
it'll support multiple accounts and
multiple blocks wow that sounds really
cool the class is going to start on
April sixteenth we'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
