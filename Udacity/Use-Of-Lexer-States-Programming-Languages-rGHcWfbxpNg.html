the use of lexer states a lexer state
like I'm in a commenter I'm not is
actually more of a convenience function
for allowing us to have different rules
depending on where we are in normal code
for HTML or JavaScript we want to
recognize things like angle brackets
because they might be part of tags or
they might be the less than or greater
than sign in a JavaScript mathematical
computation but inside a comment they
don't mean anything special at all we
want to just skip over them because
that's some documentation the programmer
wrote down for later maintenance so we
used exclusive states like I'm going to
comment or I'm not to have different
rules depending on where we are a
totally legitimate question is are we
going to use these exclusive states to
have one lexer for HTML and another for
javascript when we write our final web
browser this is a great question it's
going to turn out that we're not going
to use explicit states but we are going
to use exactly the same concept if you
think about it under the hood lexer
states are really just a cute way of
giving you two different finite state
machines two different sets of regular
expressions 14 in comments and 14 not
for example we will do the same thing
and just by writing two different sets
of token definition files here's one for
HTML and here's another one for
JavaScript we'll start with the entire
web page that we download from a web
server somewhere and we will feed that
to our HTML lexer and parser some parts
of the web page will be embedded
JavaScript and we'll see this in great
detail in later units we will gather up
those strings and keep them safe and
when it comes time to interpret them we
will pass them to another lexer this
time a JavaScript lexer that will
interpret that substring as JavaScript
and this is one of the great joys really
of computer science Turtles all the way
down or nesha nested Russian dolls once
you've learned a particular concept like
how to make a lexer you can often nest
it or have multiple of them at the same
time once we know how to make a lexer
for HTML
nothing stops us for making in htx or
for JavaScript and having them both
running as part of the same program and
that's what we'll do so officially we
won't be using exclusive lexer states
but we will end up with multiple
different finite state machines used for
lexing under the hood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
