general place such an essential role in
security we can only expect that
attackers will always try to break an
encryption scheme typically the goal of
such an attack is to uncover the plain
text from the ciphertext or to discover
the encryption key for example an
attacker may try to recover the plain
text from the cipher text that is
transmitted on the internet and you may
ask how can you attack her obtain such
ciphertext that's transmitted on the
internet the answer is actually this is
very feasible because an attacker can
use a packet capturing tool to capture
the traffic and then extract the
ciphertext in the traffic and then from
there the attacker can attempt to
recover the plain text from the capture
ciphertext so as a rule of thumb we
should always assume that the cipher tax
division submit over the Internet can be
captured by the attacker alternatively
the attacker may try to discover the
encryption key so that he can then
decrypt all the data encrypted using
this key there are several attack
methods the first simplest and yet the
most inefficient way is to use brute
force or two such blindly for example an
attacker can try all possible keys one
by one until the one that can decrypt
the ciphertext properly into plain text
and you may ask how does the attacker
know that the decryption with a key has
worked properly typically the attacker
knows what the plaintext should look
like for example if the plaintext is an
English sentence then only the correct
key can decrypt the ciphertext into data
that can be read as English this method
is very inefficient because the number
of possible keys can be huge and so
brute force or search blindly can take a
long time to succeed another approach is
to use code analysis here an attacker
has some knowledge of the encryption
algorithm and perhaps the catalyst Ock's
of data such as distribution of certain
letters or words with such knowledge the
attacker can do a lot better than using
brute force to search the entire key
space attackers can all
to exploit implementation or systems
issues for example it was shown that by
using side channel analysis for example
by observing the power consumption used
by a cryptosystem an attacker can deduce
values of certain bits of key and
therefore the attacker can significantly
decrease the key space that he needs to
search finally let's not forget that the
weakest link in security is the naive
users and they can be exported using
social engineering tricks for example an
attacker can pretend to be as salmon who
has just forgotten the key and he called
an unsuspected user for the encryption
key to a system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
