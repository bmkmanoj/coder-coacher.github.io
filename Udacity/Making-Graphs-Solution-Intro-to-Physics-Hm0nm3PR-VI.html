elimination on this one let's see if it
starts up here that means the velocity
is 0 right well it can't be the blue
graph because the blue graph starts with
some positive velocity likewise the
green starts with some negative that
just doesn't make sense we know it
starts at rest as both the pink and the
red do look at the difference here the
red immediately goes towards negative
velocity the pink goes towards positive
what actually happens well goes
downwards of course it goes downwards
we're dropping it so it's actually the
red graph is the best answer there's a
lot more to say about these graphs ways
to manipulate them and change the
amplitude period shift them and a lot of
interesting stuff to learn you're not
going to cover in this class maybe in a
later one but you should definitely read
up on it on your own if it's something
you're interested in but these graphs
sort of highlight the periodic nature of
simple harmonic motion they just repeat
themselves over and over and over and
that's exactly the property we want from
a chronometer we want it to be able to
repeat itself we want to know that every
period is the same length of time one
tick of the clock now the real question
is how do we control what this period is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
