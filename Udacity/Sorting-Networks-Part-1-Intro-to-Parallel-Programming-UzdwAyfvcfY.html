different approach to sorting generally
most sorting algorithms are data
dependent based on the values of the
data we choose to do different things
and if we sort to different sequences we
probably take a different path through
the code instead now we're going to
consider a set of sorting algorithms
that we call oblivious no matter what
input we choose the sorting algorithm
proceeds the exact same way in fact the
only data dependence we will have in the
whole algorithm is a swap operation that
inputs two elements and outputs them in
the correct order let me take a brief
digression why is an oblivious algorithm
a good algorithm for a parallel
processor like a GPU so when I talk
about an oblivious algorithm what I mean
is that its behavior is independent of
some particular aspect of the problem in
this case we're talking about a sorting
algorithm that always does the exact
same steps no matter what the input is
good CPU sorting algorithms are
generally more clever they have more
complex control flow and a lot of data
dependent decisions to run fast
GPUs aren't so great at complex control
flow instead they're great at simple
control flow and massive parallelism and
oblivious algorithms are generally a
good match for massively parallel
approaches to problems ok
let's return to sorting clearly an
example will help show what I mean this
structure that I'm showing here is
called a sorting Network the input is
placed on the lines of the left so this
will input 4 elements 1 2 3 4 each time
2 values are on either side of a shared
vertical line these values are swapped
if they are in the wrong order so let's
put some numbers on there and give it a
shot so we're going to start with the
input sequence 4 2 1 3 and so each time
two elements are connected by one green
line we will swap them if they are out
of order
so first we'll swap 2 and 4 but we won't
swap 1 &amp;amp; 3 because they're in the right
order now we will look at 2 &amp;amp; 3 and we
don't have to swap them but we do have
to swap 1 &amp;amp; 4 and finally we have 2 more
swaps to do 1 &amp;amp; 2 are in the wrong order
so we'll swap them 4 &amp;amp; 3 are also in the
wrong order so we will swap them and
voila now we've moved from an unsorted
sequence to a sorted sequence
fortunately this by tonics sorting
network scales in a straightforward and
easily programmable way so we had a
little sorting network that would sort
four items it's fairly straightforward
to expand it so that now it can sort
eight so let me try to give you a little
intuition about how that works so a buy
tonic sequence is a sequence that only
changes direction a maximum of once so
if we look at this sequence here we're
going up for a little while and then
down for a little while but we only
change direction right here so this is
by tonic how about this sequence here
well we're going down and then up seven
five three goes down then we change
direction and go back up so sort of the
trace of the sequence look like that and
that is also by tonic but we might have
a sequence that looks like this one
three two four where we go up and then
down and then up again this however is
not by tonic now why do we care it turns
out that it's particularly easy to sort
a by tonic sequence and let me tell you
how so
let's say we have this by tonic sequence
or alternatively two monotonic sequences
that we can turn into one by tonic
sequence here's what we're going to do
we're going to take the first half of
this by tonic sequence and we're going
to lay it on top of the second half of
this by tonic sequence then what we're
going to do is do a pairwise comparison
of each element here and we're going to
take the larger element and we're going
to put it in this set here and we're
going to take the smaller element and
we're going to put it in this size here
so what we've done is we've partitioned
this by tonic sequence into two by tonic
sequences one of which is bigger and one
of which is smaller and so then we can
recurse and do the by tonic sort on each
one of these sub sequences and continue
until we have a completely sorted
sequence the overall algorithm is
generally to sort two sequences we
reverse one we append it to the other to
create a by tonic sequence we split that
by tonic sequence into the larger and
smaller halves and then we sort each
half so if we look at this big picture
here these two boxes here sort two input
sequences of size four this segment here
splits two sorted sequences into a
larger half and a smaller half and then
these two boxes here will sort to by
tonic sequences that result for the
smaller half and the bigger half
if we actually did the analysis here we
would find that for an input set of size
n it requires something proportional to
log in stages overall if we actually
looked here we would find that's one two
three four five six and the first stage
compares and swaps all elements once the
next stage does two swaps and so on
and so the total complexity here is that
we have n log squared in swaps over all
well that's all nice theory but here's
the best part
what should immediately draw your eye is
that within any set of swaps every swap
is completely in parallel so if you look
at this stage here for instance we have
four swaps
but each of them can proceed in parallel
we have four swaps in this particular
stage each of those can proceed in
parallel here's a different permutation
of swaps and again these can all be
pursued in parallel and this obviously
makes a GPU programmer very very happy
now that we know how this sorting
network works let's think about its
performance when given different inputs
for each of the following possibilities
with the same number of elements what
are the comparative runtimes in units of
time so a completely sorted sequence how
long does it take an almost sorted
sequence just about sorted maybe a
couple elements off a completely
reversed sequence or a completely random
sequence so here this would indicate
that a would be the fastest then B then
D then C so our choices are a b d c c is
fastest then d ba a is fastest then b c
d or they'll all take the same amount of
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
