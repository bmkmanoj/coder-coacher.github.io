bending we have genotypic frequencies
and allelic frequencies all right so
remember for genotypic frequencies we
have three options homozygous for either
condition or heterozygous but only two
options for the allelic frequencies
because we're only dealing with two
alleles how we are most of the course
just to keep things simple if a hundred
percent of the genotypic occurrences are
homozygous plus and that means the
allelic frequency for the plus allele
has got to be one or one hundred percent
and zero for the minus allele but if our
genotypic frequency is a hundred percent
for heterozygous and we're going to have
an equal number of positive alleles in
an equal number of minus alleles so that
would be fifty percent each now in this
third scenario we've got a hundred
percent of the homozygous recessive
condition so that would be no plus
alleles and a hundred percent or one for
the minus alleles and let's look at the
last scenario the heterozygous genotype
shows that we have half so of this half
would be plus and half would be minus
and then this means that we have the
homozygous plus genotype here is equal
to the homozygous recessive and so this
completes the other half so the allelic
frequency here would be half and half
again just like in our second scenario
so what I want you to notice from this
is that even though the allelic
frequency is the same between the second
and the fourth scenario the genotypic
frequency is very different everybody's
heterozygous in the second scenario but
you have a mix of homozygous wild-type
or dominant homozygous recessive and
heterozygous individuals in this fourth
scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
