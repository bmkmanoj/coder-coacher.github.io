good or bad and artificial intelligence
like all technology is a lever for the
human mind it is a way that to amplify
human agendas if the human agendas are
good it will go well if the human
agendas are bad it will go badly and I
don't think artificial intelligence has
shown any evidence of being different
than guns or hydrogen bombs or
electricity or the Internet in having
this fundamental characteristic that
they can be very positive we're very
negative is it logically possible that
artificial intelligence could end up
being a net negative for Humanity it's
possible but I don't see any evidence
that it's at all likely to happen
especially when humanity has very
serious problems like global warming and
artificial intelligence stands a high
chance to make the world a better place
the fear that robots will somehow
enslave us because they want everything
for themselves probably doesn't make
sense for me because that's a classic
human thing that we're doing which is
projection I mean frankly I think we
should be more worried that artificial
intelligence will grow up to be smart
enough that it will notice that the
things in this world who have it really
good are the dogs and the cats they get
to lie around all day do nothing and
take care of us if you were artificial
intelligence and you were smote so smart
you could have anything would you really
want to do all the work or would you
basically pawn it off on us and lie
around the house all day I mean
obviously what why is no one worrying
about that and the answer is cuz it's
not fun to worry about that I get that
but I think we should be worried about
things in a way that's sort of
intellectually well founded rather than
sort of leaning towards fear monger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
