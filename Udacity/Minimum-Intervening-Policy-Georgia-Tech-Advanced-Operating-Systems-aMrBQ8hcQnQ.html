detail so let's do this if you look at
the timeline for a particular process of
PG it might look like this that TI was
running here God d schedule and then a
couple of other threads that ran on on
pj DX and dy so now if i want to think
about the affinity for TI with respect
to this process of pj that affinity if
we're going to schedule TI now on pj the
affinity number that i want to compute
for this guy is to indicating the number
of intervening threads that ran on pj
between the last time T I ran on it and
if I can schedule TI now at this point
of time and so clearly this number that
i'm talking about the affinity number
the smaller the number the higher the
affinity so when we say the affinity
number is to it means there are two
intervening threads that ran on pj
between the time T I got dibs on pj now
at this point of time and at this point
of thing k that's the idea behind this
affinity index so what we want to do is
in the minimum intervening scheduling
policy you want to keep this information
about the affinity for TI to run on
every processor if I a multiprocessor
with 16 processors then there is an
affinity index associated with every one
of those processes for TI it might be
that on processor one TI has an affinity
index of 2 on processor to it has an
affinity index of 4 and so on and so
forth and what we want to do is when it
comes time to scheduling TI i want to
pick a processor on which the affinity
index is the minimum so the minimum
affinity index indicates that there is a
minimum number of intervening threads on
that particular processor that's the
processor on which I want to run TI that
is amplifying the chance that TI is
going to find its memory contents the
working set in the caches that's the
idea behind minimum intervening
scheduling policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
