minded developer on the Android team at
Google so he's gonna tell us a little
bit about personas and use cases and
basically blow our minds hi I'm rich
Fulcher I started my career with a
master's degree in computer science and
was programming computer graphics for
quite a while but then I switched over
and I became a designer and now I'm a
designer and manager as part of the
Android team here at Google I think
there's a huge temptation at the start
of a project to just kind of get going
and do the thing you want to do the most
you know when you're a designer you want
to start drawing when you're a developer
you want to start building out those
api's or start coding or kind of get to
that first screen but you want to temper
that you can do that and it's okay to
engage with that kind of passion you
have for what you do but you also want
to make sure that you're you're building
the right direction the only way you can
do that is to be aware of the users so
you need to start thinking you know who
is this audience that I'm building this
thing for it can't just be me it's got
to be much bigger than that and so how
can I understand them how can I make
sure that the things I'm excited about
these use cases that I'm thinking about
really line up with what their goals and
what the needs of the user are so one
way that you can think about users is
through these of a persona you know just
trying to build out your model of how
this person other than yourself you know
one of your users and just more
information about them and kind of what
their goals and what their context of
use are when you have those personas the
next step is to really think about well
how do they act with your product and
one way you capture that them completing
a task is through a use case you know
what are the steps they go through to
complete a specific sub goal so you have
your personas and have your use cases
how do they influence the way you treat
development well something I do is I try
to refer to those personas by name
whenever I can or I try to talk to the
specific use cases and if I'm talking
just about myself and my opinions I'll
make a distinction by just repeating the
word I I'll say well III think this
make a clear kind of gulf between what I
personally think and what I as a
designer representing these personas
think should be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
