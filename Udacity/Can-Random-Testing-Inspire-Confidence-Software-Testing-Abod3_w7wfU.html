basically purely some of my own views
and opinions but the next issue we're
going to explore is the one is the
question can random testing expense by
our confidence and so what I said in
earlier in this course is the purpose of
testing is to maximize the number of
bugs found per amount of effort spent
testing and so that's really what
testing is all about on the other hand
when we start to do a better and better
job testing especially using random
testing we start to get tempted to use
those results as justification to
believe that we're creating good
software what I want to talk about now
is is that ever justified is that
something that we can is that an
inference that we can make and what I
think the answer is is a sort of a
highly qualified yes to the well I think
I can give is sort of a highly qualified
yes to the yes answer to this question
so let's go through the qualification we
have an API that we understand really
well and we have a relatively small
piece of code so for example we're doing
unit testing so for example we're doing
unit testing of a data structure or a
data structure like a balanced tree and
we have a strong and well chosen
collection of assertions embedded in
that code and we have a mature
well-tuned random tester and we've
measured coverage and showing the
coverage is good then at least in some
cases I think we can conclude the
software is pretty good what I mean
basically by this is that I could or any
of you could take the splay tree that we
looked at for the Q or a red black tree
or something do all of these things I
develop a reasonably high degree of
confidence that's correct now if any of
these conditions isn't met I would be
strongly doubt where the random testing
can inspire confidence so if we don't
have a small code let's say that instead
of small code we have adobe acrobat
reader there's no way even if we have
all these other things we could possibly
get any confidence in the quality of
that software using random testing so
for example if we don't have a small
code if we had for example adobe acrobat
reader then even if all of these other
things were true there's no way that
random testing would inspire confidence
in the quality of the product and so the
thing we should keep in mind is since
these conditions for inspiring
confidence are quite restrictive we
never just do random testing we always
use it to augment other testing methods
that might be better at shoring up some
of the weaknesses of random testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
