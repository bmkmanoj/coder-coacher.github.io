in the worst case it still has to look
through n minus 1 iterations which is
not really any better than any of our
other algorithms and let's take a look
at an example of why that is so let's
say we have this star-shaped graph and
we can see that there's a single vertex
cover that is better than any of the
others that is you pick this vertex in
the middle and that automatically covers
every single edge and no other possible
vertex cover is going to be as good so
with our randomized algorithm let's say
that we pick an edge at random let's say
we pick this one and then we have to
pick one of the two endpoints randomly
now let's say we pick this one and add
it to the cover well then we've only
covered this edge and then we start over
and reiterate and let's say we pick
edges at random and each time we pick
the outer vertex it's unlikely but it
can happen now if we do that then we've
had to go through n minus 1 iterations
to get a cover and we're going to get a
not great cover either now if we do this
you can see that we've had to go through
n minus 1 iterations to find this cover
and it hasn't remotely close to the k
equal 1 cover that is actually optimal
in this case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
