Alette Clause which is a way of doing a
local abbreviation or a local definition
say you have a relatively complex
computation that you're going to include
in one of your constraints and you're
going to use it more than once
now you could type it out more than once
but that's extra effort and you might
make a mistake so instead you could use
a let clause to introduce a new
identifier that has the value of that
expression and then use that identifier
in the subsequent constraint so for
example if our income is expressed in
terms of the sum of our of our salaries
for all of our jobs ok we could use a
let clause which says exactly that we
can introduce a new variable or
identifier called income and then we
could have expression in this case it's
an if then else expression that says if
someone is in unemployed then their
income is less than 100 L steyr income
is greater than or equal to 100 it's
just as if we had typed in the long
expression in both the places where we
used it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
