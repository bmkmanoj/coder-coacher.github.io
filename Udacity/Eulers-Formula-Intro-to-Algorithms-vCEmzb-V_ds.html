formula again and what we're gonna do is
prove by induction that this holds so we
can build any planar graph by
iteratively adding nodes and edges so
let's start off with the simplest thing
which is just a single node tada
so we can start off with just the
simplest graph of all just a node
sitting on the plane all by itself
lonely point and we've got one node no
edges and one giant region around it and
1 minus 0 plus 1 is indeed 2 so that's
our base case now we've proceed by
induction given that we're doing a proof
by induction we're gonna assume that we
have some planar graph and that Euler's
formula holds for that graph so we have
already that n minus M plus R equals 2
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add to this graph so that it's still
planar and see what happens to this
formula there's two different ways that
we can add to this graph we can add a
node and an edge together we can add an
edge between two existing nodes let's
consider this first case where we add a
new node and an edge between them and
it's still a planar graph what happens
to n M&amp;amp;R well we have one new node and
one new edge but the number of regions
hasn't changed we're just jutting into
some region inside or outside but it
doesn't change the total number of
regions and plus 1 minus M plus 1 these
ones cancel and we get n minus M plus R
which by our inductive hypothesis we
said is 2 so in that case the formula
still holds what about the case where we
just add an edge so one way we can add
an edge is inside of some other region
and let's look what happens in that case
the number of nodes is unchanged the
number of edges has gone up by one but
the number of regions has gone up by one
as well so this used to be one giant
region it's now been split into two
regions and once again these ones cancel
so our formula still holds let's just
double-check what happens if we do
something on the outside sort of
breaking into the huge vast region
around it connects say these two nodes
what have we done we still have the vast
region around but we've created a new
region here again the number of regions
has gone up by one similarly if we click
this over the number of regions has gone
up by one so if we add an edge without a
corresponding node the number of regions
goes up by one if we add an edge and a
node together the region stays the same
but the number of nodes goes up by one
so no matter what you do if this formula
keeps holding pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
