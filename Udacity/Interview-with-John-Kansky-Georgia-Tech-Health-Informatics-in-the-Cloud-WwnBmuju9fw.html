John can't ski the interim president and
CEO of the Indiana health information
exchange well China I want to thank you
for taking the time to be with us this
morning and to help the students learn
more about the Indiana health
information exchange they're already
aware of the challenges the financial
challenges the sustainability challenges
faced by health information exchanges as
you look around the country where do you
think we are on that yeah thanks mark
the sustainability has has long been
discussed and debated as a key part of
health information exchange and I think
it's helpful to view that in terms of
the three types of health information
exchanges that have that have kind of
emerged in the marketplace there are a
number of state-run exchanges run by
their respective state governments
largely funded by a recent era high-tech
funding there are private or proprietary
exchanges that are run by and controlled
by a single organization like a large
health system for example and then
there's the type of exchange which I
think most of us have been thinking
about for a number of years and the type
of exchange that we are in Indiana which
is I call a regional
inter-organizational exchange we have to
sustain ourselves by delivering services
that our customers value in exchange for
fees and making sure that those fees the
revenue from those fees exceed our
expenses the other two types of exchange
is the state-run in the proprietary in
some cases held the opportunity to be
sustained by their sort of parent
organizations if the state government
chooses to luvy attacks or or generate
or provide dollars from the general fund
of the state government they really
don't have a sustainability challenge
and in the case of the proprietary or
private exchange their sort of sustained
at the whim of the the organization that
runs it so I feel that question is most
interesting for regional exchanges and
again we really have to run ourselves
like a business or despite the fact that
many of us are not-for-profit
you need to be very conscious of having
revenue in excess of expenses the way to
do that is to focus on services that
your customers value enough to pay for
it sounds fairly mundane and it sounds
more like a business class than
informatics but it's very important for
hie s to remember to sustain themselves
the students are familiar with what I
hie does thanks to some examples that
you sent before the class let's take a
moment and look at what it takes to do
those things can you tell us a bit about
the i hie organization sure absolutely
and again stressing that are we're not
affiliated with the state government but
certainly have a good relationship with
them we're a not-for-profit 501 C 3
organization we have a board of health
care stakeholders from across the state
including many of our large customers we
have a governance body which is
extraordinarily important which governs
the data use of our data and allows
provides for confidence between
competing organizations to share their
data and have it used for our services
and the the structure of our
organization we're about 54 people
separated into three management stacks
one which is software in product
development one which is all the
customer facing functions like support
implementation customer relationship
management and product strategy and then
a finally a third stack which is largely
IT infrastructure and administrative
functions at the heart of all this of
course is the this normalized curated
database of clinical information that
you've accumulated from the many
different kinds and varieties and brands
of emrs and I'm sure and use across the
state of Indiana how do you do that how
do you bring all that together into
something that for
example can create the end of Indiana
network for patient care which makes
every patient look as though they have a
single record even though that data may
be made me exist in many different EMRs
so how we do that is through many
real-time interfaces and an ongoing task
of what we call data mapping which a
little bit more specifically is semantic
normalization of the data the best way
to explain that that I found is is that
we like to say that one organization
will send us their data in Italian
another organization sends it in
Portuguese and other organization will
send it in German we translate
everything to Latin so that we can
combine it into that a virtual patient
single patient record that you
referenced that gives us the ability
which is really the key for our past
present and the future that we're going
to be able to deliver that gives you the
ability to look at a patient's record at
the point of care as if it came from one
place even though the data came from
many places it also gives you the
opportunity to analyze across a
population or to manage the health of a
population using data on knowing that
you've got as all the the complete view
of that population patient by patient it
is very expensive I want to acknowledge
that to put the labor into normalizing
the data and maintaining the interfaces
which gets back to that original
question of sustainability and having to
work very hard to make sure you're
delivering value to customers to cover
the cost of that semantically normalized
system of repositories well that's very
interesting I've used you as the premier
example of centralized hie in the course
it does I hae see a role for some of the
newer technologies designed for a
federated environment technology such as
direct restful api is and more recently
fire sure let me start by commenting
that we describe ourselves as a
centrally managed federated structure
meaning our repositories the data and
our repositories continues to be owned
and legally controlled by the
organizations that provided the data to
us it's not our data but it is centrally
managed in a single data center which
gives us the best of both world we have
the performance of a centrally managed
structure with the governance advantages
and comfort of the providers knowing
that it's its federated but that's not
the question that you asked so let me
comment on the some of the newer
emerging standards and this is a very
practical answer because hie s have to
be practical organizations we can only
base our services on what's available in
the marketplace so using direct as an
example direct is one of the newer
standards that's finding its way driven
by Meaningful Use into the marketplace
and to that extent we are providing
services based on direct some of the
other standards that are still evolving
we pay attention to we we study we try
to anticipate we strike try and
participate at a federal level in
learning about and influencing those
standards but we of necessity to
maintain to sustain ourselves base our
services only on those that are in the
marketplace and to an extent direct is
emerging as a useful standard well thank
you and to conclude as you look toward
the future can you tell us what
additional services or directions you
see an i hie going certainly and this is
an interesting area for us because you
always have to be responsive to what
your customers are looking for next and
what in our business what the government
is is is steering towards so I took a
couple of notes of things that I start
thought might be worth highlighting for
example one of the things that we have
done in the past but we know we're going
to be doing a lot more of and I want to
distress because I don't believe there
are many if any other hie is doing this
is that we are increasingly able to put
structured data from our
repository system into the EHR is in
response to some clinical event so for
example say a patient shows up at the
emergency department of a hospital we're
able to take data from the repository
corresponding to that patient matching
them with our identity on the fly and
send that data which comes from many
many other sources outside the
enterprise where they just presented and
deposit that data electronically in the
EHR at that facility that's something
we've only accomplished with a with a
couple of different organizations in our
customer base and it's been those that
have been somewhat more sophisticated in
terms of their IT but I definitely see
things going that way if for no other
reason then we don't want physicians
clinicians to be pulled out of their
native EHR but still need to be able to
view data from outside the organization
one more example well I'll give to
quickly medication data is something
that's in great demand and high value at
the point of care we're working hard to
increase the amount and make it more
comprehensive in terms of the data that
we can make available at the point of
care we've always done that but it's a
very difficult data set to aggregate
it's worth noting that that even means
working with the state legislature in
Indiana to sometimes try to influence
policy to make the data more available
and remove obstacles the last thing that
is I think worth noting is analytics is
a word that is thrown around quite a bit
these days almost to the point that it
loses its meaning without being defined
there's a lot of things in that category
we've already tried a couple of things
in the analytic space with Miss mixed
success and it's a great question i
think for hie s whether the marketplace
is going to expect them to analyze the
data that they are able to acquire an
aggregate or whether the market is
expecting them only to provide the data
necessarily the analysis i think that's
that's an open question well John this
has been a fascinating conversation i
hie is something that anyone interested
in health informatics needs to know
about it needs to follow and I
appreciate your taking the time today to
help the students understand it better I
happy to do it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
