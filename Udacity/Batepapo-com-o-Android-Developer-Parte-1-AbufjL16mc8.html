making the course together today we have
a really special guest for you Alice
works for Google and has been working
there for 11 plus years 11 plus years so
we're going to talk about Alice's
journey in terms of a first interview
how she solves bugs and some advice
Alice would give ah herself from way
back when when she was wanting to learn
programming shall we begin
so Alice can you tell us about your role
at Google now sure so right now I'm a TL
for a new project kiosk for a tech lead
for a new project on Android it's a it's
in the very early stages so I can't
really talk about exactly what the
project is but I can tell you a little
bit about my whatever doing the last few
years so let's start at the very
beginning very beginning come in and
what happens the first few years yes
so the first six years at Google I was
in AdWords AdWords front end so AdWords
is basically how Google makes money
capsule when you do a Google search all
those as a pop up on the right hand side
okay um so I worked on and AdWords back
then it was like the first group at
Google who was doing Java all the other
engineers were you know C++ engineers
like yes so we're like the first Java
team and we set a lot of standards how
about how Java was gonna you know
setting the Java coding style for
example and you know what tools to use
so yeah it was a very fun I think it was
like fact that I was like small I
remember carrying the pager for Adwords
like on weekends all the engineers take
turns carrying the pagers and if like a
server goes down you have to be prepared
to log in you know reboot the machine it
was it was before we had sree sree means
site reliability engineers okay so so
yeah it was like it was very different I
had never imagined that when a server
goes down there are literally pages
going all in the background where people
are sort of hustling to try and get the
machine
not burden yes they could go off like at
any time the day for you so it's kind of
like you know a doctor being on call
mm-hmm
I'd imagine that as thrilling as it was
for you to get the job some parts of the
job may be stressful like this idea of
this pager is going to go off and
interrupt the fun that you were perhaps
having do you recall any instances where
you felt like this is really stressful
and hard work that we are doing so I
think when I was on enjoyed email I
think that was actually pretty stressful
time like being okay so we moved on from
AdWords so you're now doing Gmail but
for Android Android okay so actually
Kathryn I work together okay
that's how we keep together but yes so
Android is very different from AdWords I
think mainly because it's a consumer
product so there's you know it's just a
different set of users this is like you
know a lot more users and on Gmail
particularly because it's one of the
most used apps on Android the just a
pure number of bugs that we get it's
just you know it's insane especially
like at Google we have this thing called
dogfooding that means them if you're
ready your app is ready to release your
new version that you you test it with
internally of among all the Googlers we
kind of need a dog food your own product
your own dog food um and and for Gmail
every time we dog food a new version
people will be so passionate and follow
so many bugs you know we move one button
from like top right corner to the bottom
right corner and yeah don't be like you
know 20 people complaining about you
know it changes their workflow for
example so I think it was very it was a
making those decisions was really tough
because it's hard to like find a
solution that pleases everyone so it may
be surprising for some of our students
to understand but this idea of feeling
frustrated because a bug has been
encountered is not something just the
novice programmers are feeling even
expert programmers like us ah can you
walk down by them um do you have a
strategy or two you follow when you say
it come across a bug so depends on the
type of bug so books can be very
different like a you know like the most
I guess important or high-priority bugs
are like crashes for example you know
your app is just not functional and
those are probably ones that will get
looked at first I don't flag does P
zeros or P ones and also depends on how
reproducible it is P and that stands for
priority exactly yes so p0 p1 p2 an
engineer who received a body um think of
a bug and what would be your strategy to
going about fixing something like that
but this thing is one of the most it's
like a very easy way or a quick way to
you know feel like you fix this bug and
it's very rewarding cuz I can mark it as
fixed and it's like you know I
accomplished something
um I think usually first step is trying
to reproduce it so if it's reproducible
then it's much easier to fix the hardest
bugs are the non pretty simple ones
something that you know on Catherine's
Android device you saw but then on my
phone I was never able to reproduce so
that's much harder so if it's
reproducible then I can easily just look
at the logs adb logcat on the android
devices and then you know see what
happened like if they're just if it's a
crash then there will be a very obvious
back trace so you're like an
investigator you're looking at clues for
why this thing might be brilliant okay
and an android bug reports are actually
notorious for being really cryptic and
hard to read right yes it's not just us
I find them to be very verbose and yeah
they're called so yes um yeah I think
it's yeah it's one of the main big
challenges actually so that's where like
experience comes in so if you're
experienced the Android program where
you know exactly which keywords to
search for it's impossible to just read
line by line and I usually just like
prep for or you know search for certain
keywords I see so you're scanning to the
entire log and you're looking for
keywords that you can google yes okay
why are you googling these things uh
well I just I mean I do a search locally
okay it's like a find but google comes
in handy because often if there isn't
and it's something I'm not familiar with
it could be like android framework
during some you know state exception or
something that I've never seen before so
the first thing I would do is actually
google it
okay and yeah and usually on like that
say Stack Overflow
there's the almost there's almost always
somebody else who has encountered the
same mister follow similar processing
speed a find a bug they try to identify
a key word that they can search on
Google and try and interpret those
results and try and fix the bug now
what's really satisfying at least for me
as a teacher here to learn is that the
process that we're teaching our students
is being followed by an expert 11 years
into their you mentioned a statement
which was really a medic to me which is
if I don't know something and that's
really important to understand that even
after you eleven years of expertise
there are so many things that one might
not know yes it's impossible to
everything and yeah I realized it so
yeah there's something new to learn
every day actually and I might have I am
at my job I feel like I do indeed learn
something new every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
