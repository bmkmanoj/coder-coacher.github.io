access to resources these are protected
resources any program can make a request
for such a resource and we need to
decide if the request should be allowed
to go ahead it should be granted or we
have to deny it so we've been talking
about the importance of the trusted
computing base in fact when someone is
asking for a resource they are
generating a reference for that they
have to reference the resource they are
interested in or they want to use so the
trusted computing base has to act as a
reference monitor no request for
resource should go without the trusted
computing base being involved in
checking that request obviously we'll
have to see the source of the request is
and what the target or what resource is
being requested and then we're going to
discuss so how do we decide if it should
be granted as a quick example let's say
John is a student in a class and there's
a file that has the grids of all the
students who are enrolled in that class
John obviously can make a request to
read that file not only he wants to see
his own grade maybe his curious about
how other people did on a certain test
or an exam so John could make a request
to read a file in this case we not only
have to monitor the request that is
going to come from John but our access
control that we're going to do you
decide that John should not be able to
see other people's grid so in this case
the result may be you know denying the
request but the idea here is that
references have to be monitored and then
we have to make some sort of a decision
when a request comes whether it should
go ahead or it should be denied so we
talked about authentication
authentication basically tells us when
an application or a process makes a
request on whose behalf that request is
being made so the example that we're
just talking about it's a process that
John launched then it is going to have
john's user ID or UID and authentication
is how we know that this particular uid
should be associated with the process
authentication tells us about the source
ization or access control which is the
topic for this lesson it's going to
answer the question knowing the source
of a request authentication is going to
tell us that once we know the source of
a request in this case the user ID and
the target of the request which is a
file and what they want to do with this
resource is read this file should we let
them do it or not so access control is
similar to what we have in real world
you want to access something and
somebody has to decide in this case the
TCB or the reference monitor that is
implemented by the TCB whether that
access is one that should be allowed to
proceed or go forward or it should not
so let's quickly talk about how do we
actually decide this resources that we
have in the system for example files are
created by certain users or subjects you
can perhaps think if alice is creating a
file maybe she has the ability to decide
who should be able to access it or not
the intuition here being it's her file
see chooses to decide who to share it
with so in many systems actually idea of
an owner of a resource is defined this
is the subject who creates the resource
and it is at the discretion of the owner
how that resource can be shared there
are other kind of systems where this may
not be the case and we're going to talk
about that for example if you work for a
company the company may not allow you to
sort of decide how you can share certain
sensitive data about that company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
