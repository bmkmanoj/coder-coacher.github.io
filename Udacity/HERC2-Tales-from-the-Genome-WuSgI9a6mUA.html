promoter of oka too because the genes
are so close together or the allele
could alter the hearse e2 protein so
that it interacts with oka to and
directly blocks its action now the other
options aren't possible here because
they change the coding region of oka too
but we know that the mutation is within
the her c 2 gene which is beside oka 2
so this is kind of a tough question it's
really putting together a lot of the
knowledge we've talked about up to this
point about coding regions and
non-coding regions and possible
interactions among different proteins as
well as their locations on the
chromosome if the two genes are beside
each other then alleles changing the
coding region of oco-2 aren't really
possible because we're not saying
they're overlapping there beside each
other and so the two options that are
left are that perhaps we know that
non-coding regions the regulatory
regions of the oco-2 gene surround the
genome they can even be thousands of
base pairs away so a mutation in the her
c 2 gene could actually be in one of the
non-coding regulatory regions of oco-2
that reduces its transcription the other
alternative is that we actually changed
the hearse e2 protein itself and the
hearse e2 protein physically interact
with the oco-2 protein elsewhere in the
cell and it inhibits or reduces its
activity both of those are plausible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
