there's only two numbers initially that
we really care about one is the mass of
the block and the other is K which is a
constant associated with the spring that
measures its stiffness for example a
rubber bands a sort of spring and it
would have a very low K since it's not
very stiff this brings in your car on
the other hand would have a very high K
because they're very stiff and hard to
compress now right now this mass spring
totally in equilibrium this is exactly
where the mass wants to be let's imagine
displacing this mass from equilibrium so
let's move the center of mass over to
here so we've displaced our spring from
equilibrium by a distance that i'm going
to call x max and you'll see why i
called that in a second now if I pull
this mass back to x mix and release
what's going to happen is it's going to
undergo a series of oscillations in fact
if we assume that this surface is
frictionless it's going to oscillate
forever of course I would never happen
in real life but let's talk idealized
here in fact this mass will swing
through the equilibrium position here
and all the way back to a distance of
minus x max from the equilibrium so now
you can see the reason why i call this
max because as these oscillations
continue this is the furthest from
equilibrium the mass will ever reach now
what i want to do is analyze this spring
in terms of energy which we talked about
a ton in the last unit what turns out
that the potential energy stored in the
spring is equal to half the spring
constant K times x squared X in this
case would be whatever the current
displacement from the equilibrium is so
when this mass is at the equilibrium X
will be 0 when the mass froze over here
it would be x max maybe here would be
one-half of x max and so on and so if we
look at let's say three possible
positions for wear the mask could be in
its back and forth oscillations it's
like a position one equilibrium position
to this sort of midpoint and position 3
x max so I want you to tell me for each
of these three positions as the spring
is oscillating back and forth what kind
of energy does it have at each of these
positions check all the boxes that you
think apply and remember we're talking
about kinetic energy the energy of
motion and potential energy which in
this case is spring potential energy not
gravitational potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
