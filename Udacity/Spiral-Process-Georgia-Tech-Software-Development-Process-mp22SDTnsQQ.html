the spiral model which was first
described by Barry beam which is the
professor that we interviewed at the
beginning of this lesson in his paper
from 1986 that was entitled a spiral
model of software development and
enhancement and one of the main
characteristics of that paper is that it
was describing this spiral model using a
diagram which is the one that I'm
showing you here and this diagram has
become very very popular and you
probably saw it either in this form or
one of the many variations of the
diagram so I'm not going to discuss all
of the details of the spiral model but I
just want to give you an idea of its
main characteristics the spiral model is
an incremental risk oriented life cycle
model that has four main phases listed
here determine objectives identify and
resolve risks development and test and
plan the next iteration a software
project will go through these four
phases in an iterative way in the first
place the requirements will be gathered
in the second phase the risks and the
alternate solutions will be identified
and a prototype will be produced
software and tests for the software are
produced in the development and test
phase which is the third step of the
process finally in the fourth phase the
output of the project so far is
evaluated and the next iteration is
planned so basically what the spiral
process prescribes is a way of
developing software by going through
these phases in an iterative way in
which we learn more and more of the
software we identify more and more and
account for more and more risks and we
go more and more towards our final
solution our final release there are
several advantages of using a spiral
model the first one is that the
extensive risk analysis does reduce the
chances of the project to fail so there
is a risk reduction advantage the second
advantage is that functionality can be
added at a later phase because of the
iterative nature of the process and
finally software is produced early in
the software life cycle
so at any patient we have something to
show for our development we don't wait
until the end before producing something
and that of course has also the
advantage that we can get early feedback
from the customer about what we produce
the main disadvantages on the other hand
of the spiral model are that the risk
analysis requires a highly specific
expert
and unfortunately the whole success of
the process is highly dependent on risk
analysis so risk analysis has to be done
right and finally the spiral model is
way more complex than other models like
for example the waterfall model and
therefore it can be costly to implement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
