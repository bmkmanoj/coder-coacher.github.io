99% perspiration the only way to
convince someone of your ideas is to
build the system and evaluate it now how
do you go about evaluating a system such
as spin or exokernel you can
qualitatively argue that you're
achieving extensibility without
sacrificing safety simply by the way the
system is constructed but you also have
to show that you're not losing out on
performance due to the extensibility
hooks there is an interesting dilemma
when you're reading research papers how
do you make sense out of the
quantitative results from a data
research paper when you read such papers
remember that absolute numbers are
meaningless
it is a trends that are meaningful while
doing any performance study of a new
system that you're proposing you have to
identify what the competition is
remember that spin and exokernel were
done in the early to mid-90s for spin
and exokernel the competition is a
monolithic operating system and a
microkernel based operating system and
the competition at that time for both
spin and exokernel was unix as a
monolithic example and Mark from CMU as
a microkernel example and the
performance questions always centered
around space and time for example how
much better time wise is the extended
kernel whether it is a spin approach to
the extra kernel approach compared to a
microkernel based approach in terms of
performance and since we know an
extended kernel may have to incur loss
of locality and border crossing overhead
and so on compared to a monolithic
kernel another question that we may want
to ask is is the extended kernel at
least as good as a monolithic kernel
what is the code size of implementing a
standard operating system say UNIX as a
monolithic operating
system or a microkernel based operating
system or an extended kernel operating
system so that's the space question so
we can have time questions as well as
space questions when we propose a new
way of doing any particular system
component I encourage you to read the
performance results in the papers key
takeaway that you will see when you read
the performance results reported by both
spin and exokernel is that they do much
better than Mach microkernel for
protected procedure call that is when
you go from one protection domain to
another how well are you doing for that
both spin and exokernel exceed the
performance of mark and you also see
that both spin and exokernel do as well
for dealing with system calls as a
monolithic kernel does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
