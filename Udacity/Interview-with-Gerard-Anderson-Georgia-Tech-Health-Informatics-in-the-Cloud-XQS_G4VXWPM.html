to baltimore to the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health to
speak with dr. gerard anderson a
professor there and the first author of
the paper I sight more than any other
during this course the rising tide of
chronic disease in America well 0 thank
you so much for being with us today it's
a thrill to meet you I'm glad to be here
great a decade ago you and your
colleague Jane Horvath published what I
view as a seminal paper the growing
burden of chronic disease in America the
students of the course if they've been
paying attention or quite familiar with
it by now and it opened my mind to the
aggregate problem of chronic disease in
a way that really no previous paper had
done which is why I view it the way I do
so we're ten years later have we made
practice where are we well we have made
progress I mean I think what you knew
already is that as pate you saw patients
that had chronic disease but you didn't
know how many patients there were and
now we know that there are 150 million
Americans almost one out of every two
Americans that have one or more chronic
conditions and that is sort of the new
information that we were trying to bring
ten years ago now what we're trying to
do now that we have the attention of the
policymakers is to start changing the
delivery system that starts with
prevention but it goes to care and cure
for these chronic conditions and there
were making a lot less progress i was
more optimistic ten years ago than I am
now most everything that we've tried
recently has just not worked very well
well here in the last few years we've
we've tried to make the healthcare
industry adopt health IT and we've tried
to create health information exchanges
we're still really early in that but are
you optimistic that that will happen and
it'll make a difference well it is
happening so I'm very optimistic that it
will happen what I don't think we've
solved very well so far is that
board problem of a doctor I have 10
minutes to take care of a patient and
she has seven things wrong with her she
seeing nine other doctors and I have 10
minutes if I spend most of that time
looking at her medical record I now have
five minutes to talk to her and so the
challenge is how can we get that
information out to the physician in a
timely fashion for that complex patient
for the patient only has diabetes it's
pretty easy but for that patient who has
diabetes and congestive heart failure
and beginning Alzheimer's and arthritis
and seeing all these different doctors
and taking lots of different medications
that's the challenge I hope the students
remember that comment because that's
basically what we're going to talk about
in lesson 6 of the course great well you
also mention incentives I mean clearly
the health care system has never been in
scented do you see that working are you
optimistic that that's actually going to
happen in this endlessly complex
adaptive health care system so I was
just amazed when I started this work in
the 1990s that Australia had tried care
coordination programs and they had all
failed and then I said put but the
United States can do it differently or
the UK could do it differently and so
I've been looking around the world for
those models and I just don't see them
that I mean it's just sort of we know
what we need to do which is to get
everybody on the same team probably with
the nurse practitioner talking to all
the doctors but we haven't been able to
figure it out so most all of the
demonstrations that we've tried both in
the public sector in the private sector
just haven't been able to save money
reduce improve outcomes and improve
satisfaction we just don't have very
many of those things that hit hit hit
all three of them very well and we're
still working and so I'm optimistic that
we will find it but so far we just
haven't been very successful well your
paper actually ends on an optimistic
note you you point to the re-engineering
health care system a century ago around
new knowledge in public health is is it
so fundamentally different now that that
optimism might be misplaced no but I
think if you read it a little more
carefully what you'll see is I said we
moved in 50 years from a system oriented
around infectious disease to one that's
Orion Tyrone acute illnesses and then we
got that done by about 2,000 and I said
it's going to take us 50 years to
reorient the healthcare system around
chronic disease we have to start with
the evidence base we have to know how to
take care of somebody who has seven
things wrong with their when the NIH in
the FDA exclude all those people from
clinical trials we don't have the
educational system in the medical
schools oriented around that we don't
have the financing on and so right now
there isn't a real strong incentive for
hospitals and doctors to really go after
these people to take care of them in an
effective way in fact because they don't
know how to do it they want to run away
from them in most cases but this is
where the money is two-thirds of
Medicare spending is by people with five
or more chronic conditions we've got to
get the system right for these people we
just don't know how to do it yet so I
can't speak to 50 years ago but 40 years
ago I was a medical student first
getting interested in this and I
remember going to meetings and they
would say well here's where we are and
if we these trends continue we don't do
anything by right about now health care
will be consuming twenty percent of the
gross domestic product a number that's
absolutely not sustainable now I've seen
projections from OMB and others that if
we don't do anything it'll be forty
percent in 50 years do we have 50 years
well when I started working and trying
to control health care costs in the
1970s I said we'll never be able to
sustain ten percent of gdp on healthcare
now it's close to twenty so I've stopped
making projections as to whether or not
we can afford to do something what we
know is
by the time he gets to almost thirty
percent which isn't that far along
almost all the growth in the economy all
the productivity growth in the economy
will in fact go to support the growth in
health care and that's probably not
sustainable but we don't know what's
going to turn the ship around maybe it's
IT maybe it's changing me and financial
incentives but since everybody's making
so much money in health care and you
know jobs are important and financial
security is important it's going to be a
really tough change so many of us
speculate that eventually with our backs
against the wall will adopt a
single-payer system like every other
country on earth do you think that's
going to happen here in the US I was
more optimistic in the 90s than I am
today basically the americans love
choice all you have to do is go to a
grocery store and go down the cereal
aisle and look at 42 a hundred different
choices of cereal whereas if you go to
France you will see two or three in most
cases choice is what makes America and
it's going to be really hard to get the
the private insurance industry out of it
we can't even get right now many of the
states to embrace Medicaid so if they
can't embrace Medicaid which is free
money to them why would we think that
they would go to a single-payer I mean I
think it makes sense it means that we
pay a lot more for health care than
other industrialized countries because
of this choice but America seems to
really like choice well thank you very
much it's been a pleasure thank you
maybe we'll be able to get together in
ten more years and see what's happened
hopefully it'll be more optimistic that
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
