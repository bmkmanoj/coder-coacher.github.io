impressed with their amazing students
today we want to give a shout out to the
mistake makers out there whether you're
learning web development programming or
data science we know that these subjects
can be just as tough as they are
fascinating
we're inspired by students that try fail
try fail and try again we know that
these are crucial learning processes
that can really amount to something
great at the end today we want to share
some of the memorable mistakes we've
made in our learning and growing
hi I'm Cedric and so one of the most
valuable experiences I've had
programming was actually during my AP
computer science course so I was working
on a GUI based tic-tac-toe program and I
had come up with a solution to check
whether a player won I finally came up
with a one-line solution I loved it
but I kept getting indexed I found
errors and so I wasn't exactly sure how
to solve it I probably spent 4 to 5
hours total trying to fix the problem
finally I decided to just go ahead and
try and break up my code into multiple
pieces without making a single change my
coaches started functioning property and
so I learned that keeping things fancy
doesn't necessarily help you out I have
a PhD in mathematics and I have been
teaching math for about six years I'm a
great teacher and I'm good at math last
week I was giving a presentation to my
fellow of course managers it was going
great very good in fact and suddenly I
see Sebastian Thrun walking in I
completely froze I had no clue what I
was talking about after that
that was clearly a fail but what I take
away from it is I have a lot more to
learn in terms of presentation years ago
I was learning to spin fire and I use
poi which are like these kind of giant
wicks on fire on the ends of chains and
I spin them around but to practice we
use beanbags on the ends of strings and
one day I was practicing and I don't
know how I did it but somehow I swung it
behind my head and hit myself right in
the eyeball and I was really glad that
it wasn't on fire those are some of the
memorable mistakes we've made
share your experiences with us we'd love
to hear from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
