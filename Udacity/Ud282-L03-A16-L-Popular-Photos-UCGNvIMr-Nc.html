user comments on and like a photo or
picture online you may have noticed that
our function only works when we know and
can input the number of current likes a
photo has as our first argument click if
we know a photo has 10 current likes we
can do a function call to like photo
with the value 10 passed in as our first
argument and this will correspond to our
current likes parameter our second
argument is a comment string and our
third is a boolean value that
corresponds to our boolean like
parameter if this argument is true we'll
increase the number of current likes by
one so in this case because our boolean
like will be set to true will increase
our current likes from 10 to 11 and this
function call will print out the comment
great photo as well as the increased
number of likes 11 but how do we know
that a photo had 10 likes to begin with
let's think about how to automatically
keep track of the number of likes a
photo has when a person first puts a
photo up when a picture is first posted
it starts out with zero likes and also
no comments then if a few people see it
and like or comment we can try to use
our function like photo to handle this
the first function call might be from
someone who likes our photo so we start
off with these three arguments an int
value of 0 which corresponds to our
current likes parameter since there are
no likes yet a comment string that just
says nice color and a boolean value of
true for our boolean like parameter
since our boolean like parameter will be
set to this argument value of true this
should add to the current likes that
this photo has and this function call
will print out the comment nice color
and the number of likes which is
increased to 1 then say another person
comes along and likes the photo again
using another function call this time we
know that after our first function call
our current likes should have increased
from 0 to 1 so to reflect this we want
our second function call
have one as its first argument and here
our argument values are one for the
current likes a string that just says I
like this and a boolean value true which
means that the photo has been liked a
second time in this second function call
will print out our comment and the
current number of likes which should now
have increased to two but what if this
first person changes their mind about
liking the photo they still comment but
their boolean like argument will be
false so the first function call will be
the same but this time the boolean
argument for liking a photo will be set
to false this means that our current
likes won't increase so our value for
current likes which we've input as zero
should stay as zero it shouldn't
increase to one and this call will print
out the same comment but this time the
number of likes will be zero and to
reflect this change down the line in our
second function call will have to change
the value of our current likes argument
from one to zero in this call now these
function calls are updated and correct
our first call will leave a comment but
doesn't increase the likes and our
second should increase the likes by one
right now we're looking at this print
output and directly writing in the
correct number of current likes 0 or 1
in our second function call but what if
we wanted our program to keep track of
the current likes for us this would be
easier if we could access and keep track
of the number of current likes
automatically but right now that
information is only in our like photo
function definition the current number
of likes of photo has is kept track of
in the variable inside of our like photo
function definition code that's where we
change its value if someone likes a
photo and where we print it out but we
can't reach this value outside of this
definition so we can't use it in
separate programs like when we actually
call the function like photo and want to
use the value to keep track of the
current likes to access and use the
value of current likes outside of our
function definition we'll want to change
the def
Nishan so that instead of just
calculating the likes and printing them
it returns the likes as output data as a
return value this is sort of like how we
could input outside information into a
function call by including parameters in
our function definition but instead of
input this time we're producing output
that can be accessed outside this
definition this will become clearer when
we see an example so let's see the steps
we need to take to return values like
