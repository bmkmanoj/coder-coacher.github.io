are learning how to code for the first
time is to not get frustrated or
discouraged especially if you feel like
people are ahead of you or have been
coding for so long and you're just
starting out there's no way you can
catch up for me when i first started
coding it was fall quarter freshman year
of college and there's been people
who've been coding since they were six
years old or you know in a variety of
other classes in their high schools and
I'd never coded before and felt pretty
insecure about my my coding ability I
never had that that confidence that I
could you know hack something out really
quickly but I stuck with it and I think
that's what made the difference I was
loving everything that I was learning I
was motivated to go do extra credit or
you know work on assignments that
weren't necessarily due for a certain
class I was in and suddenly two three
classes in I felt like I was caught up I
felt like I could find my niche within
computer science where I could be the
best I could be the one who was teaching
other people how to do things and from
there it's been an amazing
transformation in terms of how confident
I am in my coding ability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
