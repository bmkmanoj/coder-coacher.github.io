we're going to add just the squeeze of
this here into the water we're going to
take some of the meat tenderizer we're
going to add that to just a sprinkling
of it now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my fork and I'm actually
going to start mashing up and what you
want to do is mash the strawberries up
really well and you want to mix it up on
what you're doing is breaking down the
strawberry tissue at the same time
you're helping lyse the cell zouk and
break them open with the soap and the
meat tenderizer we're going to have one
other in reading it right now we're
going to add the salt the salt is going
to come into play later when we need to
precipitate DNA it turns out DNA has a
charge to it and it wants to stay in
solution with water but if we add a
little salt when we get to the
precipitation step of alcohol it will
come out a solution a lot easier so we
want to add just a little bit of salt
maybe a teaspoon and then we're going to
mix it all up again continually mashing
to break up big chunks of tissue and
hopefully our soap and our meat
tenderizer will do the rest okay so once
you've got it nice and mixed you
remember that our second step is that we
want to break down the protein and our
meat tenderizer is going to do that in
the warm water but we need to give it
time to work so what I want to do is we
want to set the timer for about three
minutes and while the timer is going
we're going to keep mashing and keep
swirling okay it's been three minutes
mmm smells kind of good if you had to
guess what do you think it smells like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
