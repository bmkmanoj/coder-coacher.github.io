course you should have a good grasp of
Python programming if you are
comfortable making and using functions
classes dictionaries and understand the
basics of properties decorators and
lambda functions you're in good shape
for this course a few links for brushing
up on these topics are available in the
instructor notes we will be using the
flask web development framework and SQL
alchemy extensively in this course if
you are not familiar with the basics of
flask please check out the official
flask documentation or Udacity full
stack foundations course links to both
of these can also be found in the
instructor notes an understanding of
Roth two flows will also be very helpful
when it comes to securing our web api i
highly recommend completing Udacity
authentication and authorization course
or reading through some of Google's oh
off to documentation before attempting
this portion of the course I highly
recommend using a vagrant environment
for this course vagrant will allow you
to work in a virtual machine with a
shared folder you can access on your
host computer this way if anything
accidentally gets messed up in the
vagrant machine it won't affect your
host machine a link to downloading and
installing a vagrant machine
pre-installed with all the necessary
libraries for this course can also be
found in the instructor notes we will be
delving into the Google in foursquare
documentation and playing with their API
is later in this course you will need
developer accounts for both of these
applications which can be created free
of charge links for creating these
accounts if you do not previously have
them can be found in the instructor
notes as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
