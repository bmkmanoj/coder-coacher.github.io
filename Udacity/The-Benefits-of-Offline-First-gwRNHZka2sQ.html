deal with these kind of failures and
delays we could attempt a network fetch
and if that fails get fallback content
from some kind of cache perhaps the last
content we were able to get from the
network however we have to wait for the
network to fail before showing fallback
content and if the connection is slow
users still get nothing that
rage-inducing life I experienced this is
why the gold standard is offline first
offline first means getting as many
things on the screen as possible using
stuff already on the user's device in
caches and such we might still go to the
network but we're not going to wait for
it
we'll get stuff from a cache as much as
we can and then update the page if we
finally get content from the network
when we get that fresh data from the
network we can update what the user is
looking at and also save that new data
into the cache for next time if we can't
get fresh data from the network we stick
with what we've got maybe it's out of
date stale data maybe it isn't without
the network we might not know but one
thing certain it's way better than
nothing taking an offline first approach
means the user is happy online happy
offline and even happy with life I the
less the user has to care about
connectivity the better this course
covers exactly how we achieve that but
first let's see if we can get our us
correspondent Mike Wales on the line hey
we got the connection problems worked
out over here I get a whole new set up
great so Mike you're a kind of
end-of-level boss that these students
must defeat in order to progress on this
course right defeat well kind of but
it's not as scary as you make it sound
I'll be giving you some coding
challenges along the way so you can get
accustomed to actually implementing
these things taking a demo app from
online only to a fully offline first
experience in addition to coding
challenges we'll do some multiple-choice
quizzes in fact let's do a quiz now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
