and refinement all design methods
support these ideas after all we're
dealing with at large systems and the
only way that we can wrap our mind
around those large systems is to think
about them in terms of abstract concepts
and then how we going to refine each of
those abstract concepts into lower-level
implementations programming languages
design techniques typically provide some
conceptual mechanisms for dealing with
abstraction here are a few for example
the whole process of specification where
we're dealing with the what abstracts
away all the details of how we're going
to solve the problem programming
languages typically have various
aggregation abstractions such as arrays
and structs and records and objects that
allow you to if you wish avoid the
details of what all the features of
those aggregations are obviously in
object-oriented languages the whole idea
of the class hierarchy and
generalization allows you to abstract
away from all the special cases even a
fundamental thing like the parameters to
procedure calls or function calls allow
you to abstract away from what all the
various possible calls to those
functions are by specifying names for
the parameters rather than all of the
specific arguments and finally
non-determinism at least at the
specification level where you can avoid
giving details of exactly how you're
going to implement something by
specifying that you in certain
circumstances you don't care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
