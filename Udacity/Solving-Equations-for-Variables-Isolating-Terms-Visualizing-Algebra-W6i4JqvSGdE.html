equation so let's subtract X from both
sides I'll get negative x plus ZX + C y
equals zero remember I can't combine
this negative x with either this term or
this term since the variables are
completely different to isolate these
two terms that have X i subtract zy from
both sides this gives me negative x plus
z x equals negative Z Y now this
equation doesn't quite match any of
these so there must be something else I
can do well let's multiply this equation
through by a negative 1 if we multiply
every term by a negative 1 we really
change all of these signs this will
become positive this will become
negative and this will become positive
so X minus C X is equal to Z Y well that
would be this one here X minus C X equal
to Z Y this equation has just been
flipped over this was the tough way to
do it let me show you a quicker way we
know we want to get these X terms alone
on one side of the equation so if we
just subtract Z X from both sides we get
there a lot quicker z y is equal to X
minus Z X this is where your algebra
skills can come into play if you think a
little bit forward you can predict what
you're going to get try and choose the
simpler method having two x terms
isolated on the right side of the
equation is the same as having X terms
isolated on the left side of the
equation this one just happens to be
much easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
