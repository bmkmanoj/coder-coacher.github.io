analyzing social networks is finding the
shortest path between individuals in the
graph not generally because we need the
actual path but because we want to have
some sense of how closely connected
different pieces of the graph are but
the pairwise shortest path problem is of
independent interest it's actually kind
of fun and interesting to see
essentially what allows google maps or
mapquest or yahoo maps to plot shortest
paths for you to drive but another kind
of whimsical version of this problem is
the Kevin Bacon game and the Kevin Bacon
is an actor he's been in a lot of movies
and for some strange reason he's been in
lots of different movies with lots of
different kinds of people and so it
turned out to be interesting and not
always very difficult to connect Kevin
Bacon to any actor you want so so
imagine the problem goes like this so
I'm going to give you a graph G and some
node in the graph v1 call it Kevin Bacon
and some other node in the graph let's
say Emma Watson and we're going to try
to find the shortest path between them
in the in the movie version the graph
consists of the actors connected to each
other if they were in a movie together
now Kevin Bacon and Emma Watson have not
been in any movies together but there is
a short path between them now we haven't
designed an algorithm to do this yet but
fortunately there is a source on the
internet because there's always a source
on the internet that will help us with
this kind of problem there is a website
called the Oracle of bacon or Kevin
Bacon now and what it allows you to do
is solve exactly this problem on the
graph of movie actors and movies that
they've appeared in it defaults to Kevin
Bacon but you can actually put in
anything you want here but we're going
to leave it as Kevin Bacon for the
moment and ask it to find a connection
to Emma Watson let's see that I tried
this in advance and we look for a link
and bang it found when it turns out that
Emma Watson from the Harry Potter movies
was in harry potter and the deathly
hallows part 2 2011 and John Hurt was
one of the actors in that movie well it
turns out John Hurt was actually
movie with kevin bacon or is about to be
called jayne mansfield's car now this
isn't possibly the most interesting
chain but one of the things it really is
interesting is very hard least was very
hard for me to find actors that are more
than two steps away from Kevin Bacon so
I tried kind of recent people who you
wouldn't think would be in movies with
Kevin Bacon and you find out that
they're pretty closely connected I tried
really you know much older people like
Cary Grant he is also two steps away via
Walter Matthau so it's just crazy I mean
people back from silent movies back in
the very beginning of movies being made
our two steps away from Kevin Bacon
through people I haven't heard of so it
there's something special about the
position that Kevin Bacon occupies in in
this graph we can find other people
let's let's connect Charlie Chaplin and
Justin Bieber will see that that ends up
being more than two links at least I
expect three for three so Charlie
Chaplin 02 Marjorie Oh Marjorie Bennett
to Fred Willard to Justin Bieber one two
three links so the movie could be that
the the movie graph is just not really
all that wide at least among the people
that are that are reasonably well known
but that gives you a feel for the way
that the problem works now let's talk
about how we can actually solve this
algorithmically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
