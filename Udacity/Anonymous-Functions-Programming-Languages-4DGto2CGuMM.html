JavaScript interpreter is that it
supports anonymous or nested functions
however these features can be very hard
to test so let's try it out together
recall this Python example from before
where we had a nested function
definition of greeter that we returned
and the final output of this program
would be hello Gracie I'm gonna write
the same program in JavaScript aside
from some minor syntactic differences
the content is the same we make a
variable greeting initialize to Ola
variable greeting is hola we're going to
define this make greeter function of one
argument called greeting define the make
greeter function of one argument called
greeting then we're going to make this
sort of nested function greeter that
takes an argument person and here the
local variable greeter is a function
that takes an argument person so we're
in Python we used another def in
JavaScript we're using this function
keyword argument person is the same
instead of print we call write or
document dot write and we return the
greeter say hello is a variable of make
greeter hello variable say hello is the
result of calling make greeter on hello
and then we do it at the end so the real
exciting part is here in JavaScript you
can use the word function to make a new
function anywhere without really giving
it a name although we assigned it to the
variable greeter almost immediately so
you can use it at the top level to make
a function with a name where you can use
it lower down see here we just have
function and then we're listing the
arguments we didn't put a name in here
this is sometimes called an anonymous
function because it doesn't immediately
have a name so as a quiz let's add
support for those anonymous functions to
our JavaScript interpreter
all right the first part you fill in the
key details anonymous functions are
expressions we know that since they can
come on the right-hand side of something
like this anything on the right-hand
side of a var or an assignment statement
is an expression so they're a bunch of
different types of expressions numbers
strings binary operators let's just
handle the function part for now so as a
running example let's say we have a
function of two variables X
why that's going to return there some
the abstract syntax tree we get for that
will have function in this sort of
identifier position telling us what this
sort of note is then it will have a list
of the parameters and then it will have
the body list of statements and what I'd
like you to do for this quiz is fill in
these four blanks we want to return a
particular value value corresponding to
a function this is going to require you
to think back to how we treated function
definitions and function calls earlier
in our interpreter but here's a hint a
function was a four tuple containing the
word function at the beginning and then
also listing in some order the body the
environment and the parameters fill it
in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
