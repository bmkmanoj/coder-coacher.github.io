of accessibility on users with
impairments we can all relate to the
experience of using an interface which
is not accessible to us have you ever
tried to use a desktop optimized site on
a mobile device or seen this content is
not available in your country when you
are trying to watch a video online so in
a broad sense you've almost certainly
experienced being unable to access
something as we mentioned this cost is
largely concerned with accessibility in
the narrower sense of ensuring users
with disabilities can access content
however addressing accessibility issues
in the narrow sense very often improves
the user experience for everyone to see
why that's true let's look at an example
with some accessibility issues this
forum has several the user name text and
some of the text enterprise details is
low contrast so it's hard for low vision
users to read having the form labels on
the left and the form fields on the
right makes it hard for most people to
associate them and almost impossible for
someone who needs to zoom in to use the
page and this label isn't correctly
associated with the checkbox so I have
to tap or click this tiny square rather
than being able to click the label plus
the screen reader user would have
difficulty figuring out the association
so now it's we've our accessibility one
and see with those issues fixed we've
made that low contrast text darker we've
modified the design so the labels are
right next to the things they're
labeling and we fix that label to be
associated with the checkbox so now I
can check and uncheck it by clicking
anywhere on the label I'm much more
comfortable actually using the
accessible version sure I could probably
get by with the old version but it would
cause some extra stress and possibly
cause me to make mistakes if I was in a
hurry or distracted true story I once
accidentally had something shipped to me
in San Francisco instead of my parents
in Australia because of a form that
looked a lot like the previous one we
just saw so while we want to address
accessibility first and foremost to
avoid excluding people from accessing
things it certainly isn't a zero-sum
game we're more likely to make things
better for everyone by addressing
accessibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
