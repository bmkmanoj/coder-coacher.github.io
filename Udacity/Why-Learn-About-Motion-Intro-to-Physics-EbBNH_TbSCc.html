of what is motion or how do we describe
it let's first quickly go over why we
want to learn about motion at all well
first understanding motion gives you an
incredible predictive power whether you
want to know the path that a soccer ball
takes is it flies for the goal or the
speed of a roller coaster as it goes
through a loop you will need to know
about motion second this is an important
tool to have in your physics tool belt
the math and the physical techniques we
used will be used throughout the class
finally and this is the most important
reason for me personally is to solve one
of nature's puzzles there's so many
facets of nature out there that are just
begging to be understood and motion is
one of them Galileo Galilei did a lot to
help us learn about motion but before we
jump into his contributions let's talk a
little bit about Aristotle whose concept
of motion was widely accepted until
Galileo came on the scene to get some of
this historical context let's go to
Florence Italy where we'll talk to
Professor Thomas settle an expert in the
field of Galileo about some of this
context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
