line first it seems like the minute
isn't changing only the hour is changing
so I'll declare a loop variable called
hour that's going to go through all of
the hours it'll start at 1 and will go
as long as hour is less than or equal to
12 and we won't skip any inside I want
to print the hour followed by a colon
followed by the minute and I don't want
to print it on a line because all of the
hours should go on the same line
hopefully you notice that I'm using a
descriptive name for the counter that's
because in a moment I'm going to have
multiple loops and it'll be hard to keep
track of which loop counter is which if
they don't have good names let's try
this and see how far we got if I fix the
compile errors okay this is a good start
we have the first line now the loop for
the second line would look like this the
only difference is this number the
minute so I'm going to add a loop that
counts up the minutes the minutes will
go from 0 to 59 and for each minute I'll
print out all of the possible hours with
the current minute which I'll pass in to
printf so I can get rid of my comparison
code down here and let's see how that
worked well it's kind of hard to tell
because it's all on one line what I
really want is to have a line break
after I finished the first line so after
I've printed out all of the hours I want
to print an empty line to advance down
to the next line and now my table prints
out but there are a couple of issues
here it only goes up to 58 and I said it
should go up to 59 and it looks like
some is missing up at the top the stuff
that was missing at the bottom is
because of my loop condition I should
have gone to less than or equals and the
parts that are missing at the top are
probably because bluej has limited the
amount of output that it remembers in
the terminal I'm gonna try going to
options unlimited buffering and then try
this again now it actually saves all of
the data that I wanted to see all right
I think we're ready for another practice
