topic that we're going to want to cover
them separately so an assertion is an
executable check for a property that
must be true of your code so for the
square-root example that we've been
using we're defining a function called
square root which takes an argument
we're going to use that argument to
compute a result and here we're going to
assert that the result is greater than
equal to zero so let's return to the
square root of we've been using so here
we're going to define a Python function
called square root which takes an
argument there's going to be some code
at the top which computes the result and
now we're going to assume is that if the
argument to the square root was negative
this bailed out with some sort of
exception so if we reach this line in
the code then we've successfully
computed a square root result and we're
going to do is assert that that result
is greater than equal to zero and then
return it and so why did we assert that
the square root result is greater than
equal to zero because we know that my
definition our square root function is
returning the positive square root of
its argument and so at this point in the
code we know that we must have computed
a positive number so it's good to go
ahead and assert that so let's look at
some basic guidelines for putting
assertions into code the first rule is
assertions are not for error handling so
for example it would have been a mistake
at the beginning of this routine
probably to assert that Arg was greater
than equal to zero that would reflect a
condition that we want to handle with an
exception that is to say with pythons
established error handling mechanism and
not with an assertion the assertion that
we put into the code asserts the result
of our logic that we wrote is saying
it's not asserting something about the
behavior of some other entity in the
program that would generally be more in
the domain of error checking rule two
and this is really important is never
make assertion calls that have side
effects an example of a side affecting
assertion would be asserting that a
function foo returns the value zero but
where food changes the value of global
variable and the problem with
side-effects and assertions are when we
turn on optimization in Python it's
going to drop all of the assertions in
our program so we're going to have is a
program which happens to work correctly
because the assertion changes a value in
some way that's needed but on the other
hand when we turn on optimizations and
drop all of the asserts then the program
is going to stop working and this makes
the assertions worse than useless this
is almost the worst possible thing you
can do within a search
is have an assertion in your code that
changes the global state in some
observable fashion so we definitely
don't want to do this now rule three is
we don't want to put silly assertions
into our code let me give an example so
here we're starting the one plus one
equals two now is it conceivable that in
some Python program one plus one was not
equal to two sure it's conceivable if
the Python interpreter is incredibly
broken but on the other hand if a Python
interpreter is that broken nothing is
going to work our programmers are going
to run it all so in any case there's no
point whatsoever in doing a silly
assertion like this the best assertions
are those which check a non-trivial
property that could be wrong but only if
we actually made a mistake in our logic
so it's not something that could be
wrong if the user did something wrong
and it's not something that's wrong it's
just completely silly to check so now
I'm gonna let you guys write it write
some assertions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
