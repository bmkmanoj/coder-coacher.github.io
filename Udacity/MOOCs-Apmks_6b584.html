familiar with the idea of MOOC MOOC
stands for massive open online course
MOOC their courses that are delivered to
the masses without scaling up our
teaching resources to match the number
of students who register doesn't matter
if 100 students register or a hundred
thousand we still have the same initial
resource allocation for that course a
lot of companies nowadays are producing
MOOCs Coursera is producing MOOCs EDX is
producing MOOCs Udacity actually got its
start producing MOOCs although has since
has pivoted away the more a more
credentialed approach there are a lot of
interesting constraints that we wrestle
with when producing MOOCs for one thing
many of them are available for free and
when it's available for free we need to
minimize our initial resource investment
so that means we really need to be very
clever about how we design our MOOCs we
need to be clever about how we design
our video material so that we're not
expending a whole lot of money to
produce really excellent lectures or
anything like that we need to be clever
about how we design our assessments
assessments in MOOCs can often be kind
of trivial if they're just based on some
little multiple-choice questions how do
we design good assessments that don't
require us to hire an army of TAS or an
army of graders to evaluate all those
assessments these are all very
interesting issues that we face when
developing good massive open online
courses and they're really what we're
going to focus on this lesson how do we
develop good video material good
assessments good creating good things
like that without investing just a lot
of money into reaching all these
students</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
