formulation we're ready to develop the
algorithm let's convince ourselves first
that the recursive formulation would
indeed involve some needless
recomputation take the two top-level
partitions a b c x d e on the one hand
and a b c d x e on the other clearly we
will have to compute the minimum cost of
multiplying ABC in the left problem but
we are also going to have to compute it
on the right as well since we need to
pull D off from this chain at some point
and we end up doing all the work
involved in figuring out how best to
multiply ABC over again fortunately for
us there are only n choose 2 subproblems
so we can create a table and do the
subproblems in the right order the
entries along the diagonal are the base
cases which have cost 0 the product of 1
matrix doesn't cost anything and our
goal is to compute this value in the
corner here C 1 through n the cost of
multiplying matrices a1 through a n
consider which subproblems this depends
on when K equals 1 we're considering
these costs here C 1 1 and C 2 n when K
equals 2 we're considering these
problems here C 1 2 and C 3 n when K
equals 3 we consider these and so forth
in general every entry depends on all
the elements to the left and downwards
of it
there are many ways to linearize this
dag of dependence but the most elegant
is to fill out that diagonals moving
towards the corner like this we'll let s
indicate which diagonal we're working on
and then we will fill in the diagonal
entry by entry from Row 1 as far as it
goes for this row and diagonal the
column J will be equal to I plus s and
we compute the entry in the table as the
minimum of all the possible splits of
the subtree the last step of course is
just to return in this final cost the
binary tree that produced this cost can
be reconstructed from the cave that were
chosen
that yielded the least minimum values we
just need to remember the split that we
used for each entry in the table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
