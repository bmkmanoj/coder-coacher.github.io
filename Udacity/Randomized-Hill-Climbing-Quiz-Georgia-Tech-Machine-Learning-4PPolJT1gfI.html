these issues with a randomized
hill-climbing quiz so what was kind of
what is the advantage of doing hill
climbing and what does it lead to in
terms of being able to find the maximum
so so here yeah Charles this is gonna be
a quiz and I guess you're not
particularly happy about it but let's
let's take a look here we've got an
input space of 1 to 228 the integers and
so here it is kind of out on the screen
all the values from 1 to 28 and here's
the fitness function or the objective
function for each of those points it
sort of follows this not exactly
sawtooth kind of piecewise Jaggi I don't
know what to call it it's wrong and
here's the global optimum and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna run randomized
hill-climbing and we're gonna run it
this way we're gonna assume that the
algorithm chooses randomly and both
there if both directions improve so it
just flips a coin 50/50 then it does
whatever evaluations it needs to do to
figure out which way to move to go
uphill we'll use as the neighborhood of
X to be the thing immediately to its
left and immediately to its right unless
of course you're at 1 or 28 in which
case there's just one neighbor so we're
just going to use a simplification of
the hill climbing that we had before
which is it's going to check the
neighbors check both the neighbors if
there's two of them and if one of them
is an improvement it's going to go in
that direction if neither the
improvement then it's going to declare
itself at a local optimum and if both
are an improvement it's just gonna flip
a coin to decide where to go and once it
gets to the to the local optimum let's
say it sort of climbs up this hill and
ends up at this peak here it's gonna
realize that it's at the at a local
optimum and then it's going to trigger a
random restart and pick a new x position
to start at and now the question is how
many function evaluations on average is
it going to take to find X star the
tippy-top of this peak so you know maybe
you could write code to do this or maybe
you could do it with math this is
probably a little bit more involved in
most of our quizzes but it should give
you a chance to really dive in and get a
feel for this notion that it matters
kind of where these Basin
of Attraction are alright do you think
that's clear enough to give it a shot
sure alright let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
