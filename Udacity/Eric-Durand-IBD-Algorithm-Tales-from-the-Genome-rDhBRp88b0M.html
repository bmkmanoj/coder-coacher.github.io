biologist here at 23andme have been with
the company for about two years now and
I'm mostly working on their ancestry
products which ran from a variety of
different problems before that I was a
postdoc at UC Berkeley for another two
years and even before that I was a PhD
student in France we really want to know
from a computational biologist is how do
you determine IBD or identity by descent
yeah so first maybe we should define
exactly what eibd or identity by descent
is so I BD is something that refers to a
chunk of continuous DNA and we say that
two individuals share a chunk of DNA
identical by descent if this chunk has
been inherited through a common ancestor
without recombination it means that you
inherited this segments from the common
ancestor however far back it was in the
past and it was never broken by a
recombination event during meiosis so if
you want the simplest example of
identity by descent maybe is between a
parent and his child where because of
the way if I refer you back to a high
school biology because of the way
chromosomes are inherited a child will
inherit one chromosome exactly from each
of his parents and so a child is 50%
identical by descent with his parent and
it's just in this case a common ancestor
is apparent himself and the child is 50%
IVD with with the parent and so it
doesn't matter how big the segment as
the segment can be the whole length of
the chromosome itself or anything
shorter than that exactly so if you only
look one generation back in time the
segment will cover a full chromosome in
the child the full chromosome in the
child will be identical by descent with
this parrot if you go one more
generation with with a child is about
twenty-five percent IBD with each of
these four grandparents but they're
already twenty-five percent is only
approximate and you can vary you can be
more I biggie you can share more IBD
with one grandparent
done with another just because of the
way recombination occurs i see so there
may be an average week an average IBD
but it doesn't have to be exact because
like you say the recombination doesn't
happen in the same place every time
exactly and also because of our ability
to detect it there is some error some
statistically all around the estimation
of IBD which in the end will lead to
slightly different estimates but it
should be pretty close to twenty-five
percent and the further back you go in
time is a more variation you have
between those percentages and also the
shutter whose segments become and the
harder they become to detect so if you
want to relate IBG and IBS for example
the main difficulty with IBD I guess is
to for this first we do not observe the
recombination process it would be great
if we had some kind of black box or
Oracle that tells us well this is where
recombination occurs but we don't see
that and even worse we don't even know
the genealogy that relates to
individuals even if they're kind of
closely related is their second cousin
most people just ignore the trees that
connect them so you don't know how far
back in time they were connected and you
don't know where recombination occurs so
the main problem is that you cannot
observe IBD directly from the data you
can only observe a proxy of IBD which is
IBS identity by States you can
definitely detect segments between
individuals that are identical or
roughly identical and so this is how an
IBD algorithm works we start by scanning
the chromosomes and finding long
segments of IBS and that gives us some
kind of candidate pool of IBD segments
and then we apply vice filters from
these sets to extract the IBD segments
and those filters are very depend on the
length of the segment meaning that it's
pretty unlikely to have a very long IPS
segment that was not generated by a
common ancestor we have we also apply
filter for the frequency of the segment
that was
you narrated if the segment is very very
frequent in a population maybe it's not
idea it's not a biggie it's just ideas
and that arose to to being fixed in the
population because maybe of natural
selection or other other reasons so
frequency quality of the segment which
contains many mutations then it's
unlikely to be IBD we have a lot of
filter so yeah it sounds like you really
have to think a lot around how to make
sure that it's a true identity by
descent and not like you say either
coincidental or something else so let me
make sure I even understand this the
smaller the segment that the smaller the
segment that appears to be commonly
shared the more likely it could be that
it's just you know a match of identity
by state by chance with someone random
and the population that's correct so
maybe I should clarify the definition of
IBD a little bit because under the
definition i gave actually everyone is
IBD everywhere just because we all have
a common ancestor if we go far enough
back in time so when we talk about IBD
we usually restrict ourselves to the
recent past say a few tens of
generations maybe a thousand years and
what what's beyond this point we will we
just don't have the power to decide
anymore if it's IBD or not but if you go
if you look small enough everyone is ibe
everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
