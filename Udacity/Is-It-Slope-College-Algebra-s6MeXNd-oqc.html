equations y equals 5 x and y equals 12
minus 3x are the only two equations for
which the slope can be found from the
coefficient of the term with an X to the
first power in it the equations here
which don't just make straight lines
when we graph them which as we'll learn
later on in the course are those that
have factors of X combined with other
things besides constants so those would
include this first equation this very
long not very nice equation this one and
this one definitely don't have this
property in fact right now we have no
idea how to talk about the slope of a
line that isn't just a straight line if
we have some sort of funky curve how can
we talk about the direction that it's
pointing it's pointing in different
directions at all these different points
so we can rule all of those answer
choices out we'll talk more about the
slopes of these four remaining equations
