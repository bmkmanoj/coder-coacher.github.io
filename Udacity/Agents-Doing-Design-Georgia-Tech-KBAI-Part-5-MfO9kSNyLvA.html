configuration is a kind of design a kind
of routine design and one metal pudding
configuration is planned refinement in
configuration all the components of the
design already known but we have to find
some arrangement for the components and
we assign values to some of the
variables of those components to arrive
at an arrangement here is a design
specification that one begins with here
it might be a plan for designing a chair
as a whole and once we assign values to
some of the variables at the level the
chair then we can refine the plan for
the chair into a plan for the chair legs
to chair seat and so on order the sub
might be subject to certain constraints
there are in fact a number of AI systems
they do configuration design many of
them are being used in industry some of
these AI systems use meta select plan
refinement the way we have shown it here
others use case based reasoning in fat
air systems use a variety of methods for
doing configuration design including
model based reasoning and rule-based
reasoning what about more creative kinds
of design design in which not all the
parts are known in at once since we just
discussed the flashlight example and you
can't have systems thinking it is a
revisit that example in the context of
creative design so this is a schematic
of the flashlight circuit it is a switch
the battery to build as earlier and a
systems thinking we discussed how
structural behavior function models
capture the knowledge that when the
switch is closed electricity flows from
the battery of the world and the bulb
converts that electrical energy into
light energy let us suppose that this
particular electrical circuit used a 1.5
volt battery and created 10 humans of
light tomorrow someone comes to you and
says I want 20 lumens of light design a
flash turn electrical circuit for me how
will you do that you might go through
the structure behavior functional model
this particular circuit and do systems
thinking you may recognize that the
amount of light created at birth is
directly proportional to the voltage of
the battery instead of creating
telemon's of light you need 20 lumens of
light you might say I'm going to use a 3
volt battery so far so good you have
done system thinking in the context or
design thinking
but now let us add a wrinkle suppose
that a 3.0 volt battery is not available
at this point a teacher tells you it's
okay if a 3-point volt battery is not
available you can connect to one point
volt batteries in series to 1.5 volt
batteries connected in series will give
you the voltage of three worlds
accepting the teachers advice you can
now create an electrical circuit that
will use to 1.5 volt batteries in series
and create light of 20 limits but you're
not just created this particular design
you also learn something from it every
time you create a design every
experience is an opportunity for
learning in the mid-1990s sam botta here
at Georgia Tech created a program called
ideal idle did creative design in
particular either would learn about
design patterns from simple design cases
that kind we just talked about I'm sure
most of your family with the notion of
design pattern design patterns are a
major construction software engineering
where design patterns are not just in
software engineering but in all kinds of
design for example architecture and
engineering and so on it is Sam's way of
capturing the design pattern that can be
learned from the previous case if you
know the design of a device that changes
the value some valuable from one value
to another value and you want another
design the changes the value the same
variable to some other value not the
same as the previous design one way in
which you can create the new designers
by replicating the behavior of the
previous design so not just having
behavior be one for the first design but
having this behavior be one as many
times as needed it is connected to the
example we just saw if you have a design
of an electrical circuit that can create
10 lumens of light and you know how to
do it to some behavior be one I need
your design an electrical circuit that
can create 20 lumens of light but you
don't know to behavior be too then this
behavior be too is a replication of the
behavior be one by connecting components
in series once Sam's program ideal had
learned about this design pattern of
cascading of replication then when it
was given the problem of designing a
water pump of
our capacities in the one available it
could create a new water pump by
connecting several water pumps in series
thus ideal created new designs in one
domain the domain of water pump through
analogical transfer of design patterns
learned another domain the domain of
electrical circuits we would form the
perspective of the new domain of water
pumps initially did not know about all
the components about all the water pumps
that will be needed but sams program
either was creative enough to know that
the pattern of problems here in water
pump is exactly the same pattern that
was also occurring in the domain of
electrical circuits Sam's theory
provides a computational account of not
only how design patterns can be used but
also about how this design patterns can
be learned and transfer to new domains
there is of course a lot more to design
we said earlier the design thinking
engages problem solution coevolution
it's not just a solution involves while
the problem remains fixed whether the
problem evolved even is a solution
involves it's not yet clear how humans
do this kind of creative design where
there is problem solution coevolution
there's certainly a few AI systems
capable of problem solution coevolution
