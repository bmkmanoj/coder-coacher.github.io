they take a lot of practice remember you
can always go back and review the
lessons if you need some help the answer
to this problem is negative 28 let's see
how we got that the first thing I notice
when I'm looking at this problem is that
there's this inner parentheses inside
the absolute value so we have to perform
the operations inside the parentheses
before we do anything else when I'm
looking at the operations inside these
parentheses I notice that there's an
exponent and we need to do exponents
before multiplication and before
subtraction so let's do five squared
remember when you're doing problems like
this you should always copy the
operations that you didn't perform and
only perform one or two operations at
each step so I'm going to copy
everything down the only thing I'm going
to do right here is evaluate this 5
squared and I know that 5 squared is 25
the next thing I can do is evaluate
multiplication and division there's only
one multiplication inside the
parentheses so let's evaluate that and
copy everything else down four times six
is 24-25 and I have to cube that and i
still have my absolute value since
there's one more operation inside these
inner parentheses I have to do this
operation before I can do anything else
and remember to copy everything else
down 24-25 gives me negative one and I
have to raise negative 1 to the third
power now I can perform the operations
inside the absolute value and I can
evaluate my exponents first so I have
the negative absolute value of 3 cubed
is 3 times 3 times 3 which is 27 and
then we have negative 1 cubed which is
negative 1 times negative 1 times
negative 1 which is negative 1 or you
could also remember that a negative
number raised to an odd power would give
me a negative result now we only have
one operation left inside of the
absolute value which is 27 minus
negative 1 so i have negative the
absolute value of 27 minus a negative 1
which is 28 from here remember that this
negative out front actually means
negative 1 times and the absolute value
of 28 is 28 so i have negative 1 times
28 which gives me negative 28 these were
some good practice problems for both
absolute value and order of opera
relations why don't you try a couple
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
