areas of the fun room to other people at
the architecture firm she's probably not
going to want to talk about any values
of x that aren't allowed she'll really
only want to focus on the ones that are
in the domain in the set of allowed
possible values for X or inputs as I
said earlier the domain of this function
is x is greater than zero because of the
restrictions placed upon it by the real
life situation it's representing as
they've learned throughout the class one
of the best ways to visualize most
things in math is through graphing and
domain is no exception looking at what I
have plotted here we can see that the
only points on our graph have x
coordinates that lie within this domain
it's a little bit hard to see here but
rather than having a filled in circle at
the point 0 0 there's actually a tiny
little open circle just like we saw on
number lines before the fact that
there's an open circle at this endpoint
is just showing that this endpoint is
not included in the domain if instead we
had X is greater than or equal to 0 this
would be a filled in circle but we don't
and of course we could also write our
domain in interval notation X lies
within the range 0 to infinity not
including either end point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
