Ling I'm a product marketer here at
Udacity and I'm also the founder of a
site called breaking the tech which is
all about helping anyone get a tech job
no matter your background and I'm really
excited that you're joining us today
because we're gonna go through seven
steps to help you launch an awesome
career in the new year and we're really
privileged to be joined by dia Ranjan
who was actually one of our graduates of
the Udacity digital marketing nano
degree and dia is embarking on a very
exciting career change here in the new
year and she's graciously agreed to
share her story with us so dia if you
wouldn't mind introducing your
background to the audience and then
we'll take it from there yep sure so hi
everybody i'm dr engine i am a recent
graduate of digital marketing nano
degree program from Udacity and yeah
thank you so much Udacity thank you so
much Jeremy thank you everyone for
giving me this opportunity to be here to
share my experiences with you and to get
an absolute fabulous career counseling
from Jeremy I'm so looking forward to it
and just a brief background about myself
so I'm a sales and marketing graduate I
have an mba in marketing and in sales
and when my first career break was with
l'oreal the cosmetic company I was
wearing many hats there as a
professional in their monitoring
marketing field so basically I was
basically taking care of their beauty
advises the the advisors who were placed
in the L'Oreal counters to help
customers with their purchases and I was
doing product trainings with the beauty
advisors as well as with their sales
team and also handling part of customer
complain and very happy I was there for
quite some time and then as life takes
over you need to you need to make a
change so my family had to move here and
there was a break and I was really
passionate about continuing my career
but then family life took over and I had
to take a break but in the meantime I
was also volunteering in a lot of
organizations as a media coordinator I
worked with one of NGOs over here and
then I also was doing a volunteer
outreach work with an educational
institution and there was a time and I
really started thinking that I need to
get back maybe to some studies and then
I took up a course in environmental
compliance and pollution prevention and
I joined while I was doing that I was
also I tied up with a company called
joint venture Silicon Valley and I was
doing greenhouse gas emissions studies
for city of Sunnyvale
an outreach effort for Sierra Club as
the recycling intern but while I was
doing all these outreach efforts and
going out and educating people I thought
the marketing is the core of everything
and I'm so passionate about this area
that I nearly need to get back to it and
I started digging deeper into courses
that will help me that would that would
give me confidence to get back to the
field after quite some time and the
through a thorough research Udacity came
up to be one of the best courses one of
the things that you'd asset is digital
marketing course stands out from the
rest is the the campaign that we do the
running the live campaigns and
optimizing it and knowing how it works
absolutely so it gives you a confidence
that when it is thrown to you in the
real life you're able to do that and I
did all that and I'm so confident that I
will be again back to my career path
very soon yeah I was looking forward to
it cool well thank you so much for
sharing your story with us and being
willing to share with our audience out
there I think you have the perfect
background for folks out there who are
saying hey I also tried different things
in my career I've done a little bit of
this and a little bit of that I'm trying
to figure out how to take that next step
where do I belong
and I think that they're gonna realize
from your own experience that pretty
much anything is possible in this new
year if you take a very systematic
approach and that's what we're gonna
talk about today right so it gets
started tell us a little bit more about
sort of where you feel like you belong
in terms of all the different marketing
roles out there there's product
marketing there's content marketing
there's social media marketing what do
you think is the right fit for you
I was looking there are a lot of areas
where you could be drawn into like
content really kind of draws me I I
would want to do something in that field
but something right now that I'm looking
at is a social media marketing role
typically maybe a social media marketing
specialist to start with that's a role
that I'm looking at and I think that is
a big role in terms of encompassing you
know a myriad of activities and things
that you need to do as a social media
specialist so that's something which I'm
really looking forward to absolutely
it's one of the fastest-growing roles in
marketing and around the world frankly
so definitely positioning yourself as a
feature well they're right yeah and I
think one of the things for the folks
out there to think about is it's easy to
say you know in the New Year I wanta do
something exciting
now I do something on passion
about and that's definitely a place
where you want to start but I'll just
leave it there think about how can I
actually add value to the organization
I'm about to join so I'm really thinking
about from the perspective of the
recruiter and the hiring manager
and I think the beautiful thing about
your approach is that you're saying you
know I could just say I want to do
marketing in general I'm excited about
digital marketing but instead I'm really
focused on what they need it's time
gonna come in and make sure that their
social media is on point and delivering
real value right and I think because
you're starting with that positioning
you're gonna be much more successful
down the road than someone who just says
hey I just want to be marketing more
broadly right absolutely yep and so for
those out there who don't quite have
DEA's a clarity as of yet have no fear
there's definitely time to come here but
a couple quick tips to get you started
is think about who you can talk to in
this new year who can give you a sense
of what the roles look like in your
space so whether it's engineering or
marketing or anything else try to figure
out is there someone who I can actually
shadow a little bit maybe spend an hour
- at their office seeing what they do
all day and then figure out is that the
kind of stuff that I love doing if I
think back about my own experiences have
I been in that moment of flow really
lost track of time I was so excited
doing what I was doing and this is going
to give me chances to be in that same
state again and again in the future and
if you can sort of map your past
experiences against the future potential
of what you're seeing from others out
there you're gonna know that you're in
the right place and having that solid
foundation makes everything else so much
more effective we're gonna see that
right now right yeah so we're gonna next
step once you understand the position
that's right for you and talk about how
do you actually win that position not
just sort of getting the job but even
before that how do you win it in the
mind of the recruiter the person who's
sort of the gatekeeper for the job that
you want okay and we're gonna start with
your LinkedIn profile so again thank you
so much for letting us check this out
it's already in really good shape I will
tell you that and the reason I want to
start with a LinkedIn profile is though
even though resumes are powerful a lot
of times all the time that you spend
building out a really great resume gets
stuck on your hard drive you could have
spent 20 hours on the most beautiful
bullet point but if it's sitting there
on your hard drive and no recruiter in
the world can see it it's not doing you
an ounce of good yes
whereas if that same bullet points on
LinkedIn 24/7
365 it's doing really great value for
you because we recruiters couldn't find
it anywhere anytime right so I just
wanted to say something that having a
good LinkedIn profile is one of the
biggest challenges when you are really
looking for for a job it's like do I
have the right things in there I am I
projecting myself in the right way my my
qualifications my capabilities what I'm
really wanting to do one do for the
organization is it all set up in the
right way so that's something which
really keeps you know you keep worrying
about it that is that the right thing
that is out there so I would really love
to have your experience and your details
on how things are absolutely yeah so
let's dive in here I want to give you
and everyone out there sort of those the
key tip which will hopefully take some
of the stress out of it I think a lot of
the anxiety with LinkedIn or resumes for
that matter comes from not knowing what
the goal is you're trying to guess okay
maybe I saw some tips about bullet
points should be in the active voice or
have this format or blah blah blah but
you're not really clear like why what
does it matter and I think the easiest
way to sort of organize your entire
process is to come over here on LinkedIn
and go to the jobs page so we actually
skip ahead a little bit and check this
out together
and let's just find a job that you might
be interested in so again social media
you've identified your passion maybe
we'll just say a social media manager
who's in the Bay Area just to keep keep
it targeted here and there's obviously
gonna be a bunch of results
looks like I'm over 400 just in this
area alone cool startups like lime bike
more established companies like Trulia
there was one that I was looking at
today that actually got Mike gave me got
me a little excited it was at William
Sonoma okay I don't know if you're a big
foodie or not okay cause I was thinking
let's check this one out just because it
all get our taste buds watering here and
get us excited so social media manager
at the Pottery Barn and basically the
reason that you want to start with this
is because now you understand what the
recruiter is thinking about okay so a
recruiter and a hiring manager typically
have designed this job description
everything from the title to the bullet
points down below that's their language
that's what they care about their North
Star and if you can reflect that back in
your profile you are literally speaking
their language
and that's a powerful thing as opposed
to them trying to guess why your bullet
points are relevant so first thing I
would do going back to your profile is
make sure that everything in this top
area which is going to be front and
center for those recruiters who are
checking out your profile is totally
aligned with that job description so for
example right now you say digital
marketer social media marketing that's
pretty good because you have social
media right there in the headline and
this actually counts for a lot more with
linkedin's SEO and any other part of the
profile okay because it's strictly
character limited it's kind of like
Twitter and so it's less easy to game
then like a giant piece of text down
below so that matters a lot the part
though that would give me pause if I was
a recruiter is I would say digital
marketer and social media marketing
she really focused okay I bring her for
an interview is she ultimately gonna
take a digital marketing job somewhere
else and leave me stranded okay and so
the X to the extent that you're ready to
really focus I would make sure that your
headline explicitly says social media
marketing or social media manager and
that way the recruiter who comes there
knows they're in the right place they
found the person is totally aligned down
below just check out your summary which
is the next most important section say
experience marketing professional and a
recent graduate of the DMM D program at
Udacity digital marketing gauging
audiences with meaningful information on
products at the right time value
openness to new ideas and have these
specialties and so what I would say is
you're definitely doing a good job here
in the sense that you have the
specialties that they care about on the
job description so again things like
social media management tools the
ability to work with tools like
HootSuite and sprinkler that's that's
really useful to make sure you have
those right here in your specialties but
what I would also do is I would give
them some examples of how you've used
those skills in a really powerful way so
if I'm a recruiter
I'm totally scrambled mm-hmm you know
I've got 100 200 300 candidates to get
through and it's already five o'clock at
night I need to get out of here and so
that means I need shortcuts I need
someone who can make my life easier and
the way you can do that is don't make me
dig through all the stuff down here give
me the very
highlight reel of your career right up
at the very top in the summary section
and if you can give me three type ala
points about here's this great social
media project that I did for the Sierra
Club well here is this awesome thing
that I did for good shop and gave me the
really sort of quantitative results
behind it okay that's gonna immediately
knock my socks off and say hey I'm in
the right place right actually you know
Jeremy that was something I was thinking
about because I didn't have anything
very targeted and specific up there this
is more like a generalized overview of
Who I am and the specialties that I have
I was thinking how do I put that up
there so that you know it really
attracts their attention the very first
look when they get of the summary it's
like they really know in a quantitative
way as to the things that I have done so
that was really something running back
and back of my mind and I'm glad you
just got it out I was thinking what to
do there absolutely yeah make it easier
for them to say yes and then to the
extent that you want to fine-tune the
balls down below both on your LinkedIn
profile and your resume the one piece of
advice I would have is that any job
you're applying for but especially
social media is gonna be focused on
results okay
I mean one can tweet anyone can post an
Instagram but who can actually connect
that to business value right and I bet a
good shop you actually did a lot of
really cool stuff that led to results
for their business yes whether it was
new customers or web traffic or whatever
and that's what I'm hungry for here okay
so if we go back to the job description
we're gonna see that they care about
things like you know driving pageviews
driving engagement driving outcomes that
matter and so you want to make sure
those same things are listed back on
your resume and on your profile okay so
to the extent that you can quantify it
or at least say hey this was
best-in-class work I want to see that
right here to give me confidence that
you're the right person for this job all
right cool
and I think other than that it's great
that you have internships and some
volunteer experiences down below
LinkedIn did a study a couple years ago
40% of recruiters say that volunteer
experience is on par in their minds with
actually paid job experience so don't
hold back on that okay and then I just
wanted to stop you and ask you to look
back on my my internship that I did I
think I need to quantify their I don't
have anything up in terms of the
quantity or the percentages or something
like that which is really more quant
well do you think I need to do that and
my bullet points yeah great question to
the extent possible definitely okay and
let me give you some examples here so
for instance you say provided public
comments I'm adopted of environmentally
sound practices it's almost like dot dot
so what okay what did the public
comments lead to any changes in policy
did it lead to politicians coming to the
events okay did it lead to the Sierra
Club raising money from some of the
people who give us public comments okay
anyway you can quantify that and show
the impact that's gonna have way more
magnetic power over the recruiter all
right I got it yeah cool I love that you
have Udacity degree here listen yes and
you'll see why that's important a little
bit as well as your undergraduate and
graduate degrees volunteer experience
and one of the things I was especially
impressed by is don't worry so much
about endorsements and skills like that
I think recruiters don't necessarily
give that a ton of value okay yeah my
mom endorsing you for excel okay all
right but a recommendation where someone
says dia actually knocked out of the
park for us that is worth so much
because everything above that is your
word this is their word this is
objective right and that's really
powerful okay so I want to stop there in
terms of the profile I need additional
questions yeah the question that I was
wanting to ask was in terms of
quantifying the work that I have done
and you really answer that and also in
terms of recommendations I read some
sometimes you know so many times or hear
from people that recommendations are
really important you need to have two to
three minimum do you think there is
there is needs to be quantified in terms
you need to have three recommendations
or something like that it's a good
question I think it all depends on what
the positioning that you want the
recruiters appreciate is gonna feel like
and what I mean by that is right now I
think ken is vouching for your ability
to do good work in a very broad sense he
doesn't really get into the details of
what you did in particular just say hey
it was really quick learner very
professional use new technologies which
is all nice if there's someone who can
vouch for your social media work okay
and actually say hey she totally kicked
butt for us when it came to building our
brand establishing her presence getting
followers turning followers into revenue
or other sort of
important outcomes okay that's going to
be a valuable compliment it would be
yeah and I wanted to ask you at this
juncture where I am where I'm looking
for a job how do I look for
recommendations from whom do I look for
recommendations for the work that I have
done or the course that I have taken any
any idea as to whom I can approach so
tell me a little more about what you've
done in the social media space in
particular so while doing the scores I
told you this course was a big
confidence booster I what I did on my
own typically think that I did on my own
was I just started I was out of this
course I was fresh out of this course
when the Napa Valley fire happened and
then that gave me a really big reason to
to do something in the social media
digital marketing field and I started my
GoFundMe page where I generated around
seven hundred to one thousand dollar
donation for the Napa Valley Community
Foundation so that was something that I
did totally on my own and then I have
also been doing designing my website so
I'm doing that recently but that those
are all the projects that that is
something that I'm doing on my own I am
not associated with anybody or any
organization or doing any freelance or
project so how do i how do I do that how
I got a recommendation that is what the
fundamental question of career change
right yeah it's almost like chicken in
the egg how do you make the switch if no
one will give you the chance to make the
switch in the first place get that
experience right and so I think the way
that you do it is you take a little bit
of a shortcut you say hey it might be
tough to immediately get that full time
job at williams-sonoma okay but could I
go to say a non-profit that needs social
media help I can offer to work pro bono
for them to build up that portfolio so
whether it's the Sierra Club or you go
to idealist org or even catch a fire
which is a site that matches
professionals with nonprofits in need a
very sort of high level volunteering any
of those sites will connect with
organizations where you can come in
maybe they make a difference and I list
that not only on your website but also
your LinkedIn okay and get the
recommendation to your point but a test
of the value created oh that's a good
idea because I was not looking at that
area at all I was thinking that you need
to get some projects or a full-time work
but this is a good idea to start with to
just get inside and get a real feel of
what it is and then you know prove
through your work and get
recommendations this is a good idea I
I think I would definitely do that yeah
it's easy to say oh man I have to
immediately go from zero to six yeah
it's like how should I do that you know
these are the things that keep running
in your mind what should i do how should
I do so I'm so glad to be here and get
all these information and ideas from you
to really be helpful cool cool we'll
take it one step at a time so yeah
definitely ease into this role get some
that experience below that portfolio
you'll be ready for the next step okay
so let's say that you do that and now
you're ready to move on and actually
start looking for jobs all right I would
say whoa hold on one second before we
get there I know there's always
tantalizing to dive into the job search
process I would think about a
foundational step of not only
positioning yourself but building your
network ahead of time okay and the
easiest way to do that is to let
LinkedIn be your guide and what I mean
by that is by going to my network and
going to connect you can actually bring
all the people that you know in the real
world into your LinkedIn Network so for
example you can have these people who
you're already recommended with or if I
go back to the previous page and go to
more options and you can import contacts
okay alright people always say oh man
import contacts that sounds a little
scary right but here's why it's
important if you can bring in your work
email account and your personal email
account and your school email account
and your phone's address book you're
taking all the people that you know in
the real world and you're adding it into
your online network right and the reason
why an online network can be more
powerful in some ways than even a
physical in-person network is because
you can then start to search LinkedIn
not only to find the right person at the
right moment yeah so someone you might
know williams-sonoma for instance right
but even if you don't know anyone at
williams-sonoma I guarantee you there
are people that you know right now who
do know people there okay and they can
introduce you
so that will be through the connections
exactly yeah and so only LinkedIn can
show you that invisible network can
shine a light on it and let you know hey
there are all these ways in that you
didn't even know existed right right so
definitely start by getting all those
folks connected with you on LinkedIn and
then in the next step you'll see why
it's so important so you've got your
great positioning you've got your
network starting to build now the
rubbers about to hit the road okay let's
begin a job search so we come over to
the job section again and one thing I
would recommend is
Nalla do you want to do that search like
we did before to find the William Sonoma
job but when we do it we actually want
to make sure that we're automating it
one problem that say job seekers running
to all the time is that they're kind of
up and down when it comes to searching I
think because that's an emotional
process right yeah it is you just think
you know maybe this I should put this in
terms of job maybe social media
marketing or content coordinator what
should I do and then the area of it
should i target should I talk in a
particular city or an area as a whole so
yeah those are the questions that keep
running on your mind yeah what should I
go about it absolutely and I think the
beauty of automation here is that you
don't have to worry about that every
single day you don't say oh man I just
got a really sort of annoying rejection
yesterday for my dream job I'm just
gonna give up instead if you say hey I'm
gonna create a search alert and
basically get notified every day for the
social media jobs in the Bay Area now
you're letting the computers who are
totally emotionless just take care of
all that and keep a steady stream of
good opportunities coming to you no
matter how you're feeling so I think
that's the first foundation in terms of
your question about the exact role to
search for I would search for a couple
and create automations for each of them
okay and then in the same way that great
marketer is a B test their marketing I
want you to a B test your career alright
so if you're getting more traction with
social media coordinator and social
media manager maybe turn off that search
okay if you're doing better in the East
Bay then in the South Bay or vice versa
you know maybe that's something that you
sort of tweak as well but at first I
would start relatively broadly and let
the information from your experience out
there in the world be R guide oh that's
a good idea that's a good point
I mean generally I tend to put San
Francisco Bay Area but that's a good
idea to just check various areas and
also various job titles or roles and
then go from there yeah absolutely
yeah and what I'm gonna recommend then
is gonna be a little bit controversial
so I have to warn all the listeners out
there okay but I actually believe that
there's a false dichotomy about applying
for jobs out there which is that people
say you've got to either apply for the
job or get a referral I'm actually gonna
argue that you need to do both let me
explain the logic behind it so once you
have these jobs streaming into your
inbox you're gonna be one of the first
people to see those jobs because
LinkedIn is going to show you hey this
job was just posted an hour ago and you
can actually see by clicking on some
alone
that you would be in the top 10% of
applicants so you're one of the first
five people to apply the reason that's
so powerful to apply early think about
it from the recruiter in the hiring
manager standpoint again empathy is so
important here right getting in the
first job application for a brand new
job it's almost like Christmas morning
right you can't wait to run down to the
tree unwrap the present everything is
exciting but then the tenth day or the
twentieth day after the job isn't posted
and you're receiving your 500th
application that's like January 7th and
your tree is still there in the living
room and you're like what is going on I
just can't wait for this thing to be
over right and so if you want to be that
shiny president of the tree be one of
the first applicants yes yeah this is
something that I had been thinking about
because there are a lot of times where
I've seen job openings and they have
been really so close to my heart maybe
in terms of the the industry or the job
profile and it's been like almost maybe
10 days or 15 days and I'm like should I
apply what should I do
so I think this is a great point to just
start off as soon as you see it and have
all your alerts set in so that you just
get the alerts as soon as possible and
you apply there absolutely yes but now
here's the and part instead of people
report ok I don't want you to rest on
your laurels
ok another big trap is a job seeker
saying hey I just applied to 100 jobs
today I'm done I'm gonna go on vacation
for the next two weeks and then
inevitably because of the sort of online
application black box we have no idea
what's happening you don't hear back we
get rejections and then you just give up
the way that you're gonna increase your
chances and all the data supports this
is that you want to pair that early
application with a referral from the
inside ok
and now the referral process can be a
little bit daunting yes I think so yeah
yeah tell me about your experience there
so there have been a lot of companies
typically I've been I told you I've been
looking in food health and education
industries and there have been a couple
of companies which I really haven't
wanted to because they kind of got a
nexus between digital marketing or
environment or digital marketing and
health so and I was wondering because I
didn't know anybody in that industry so
I was like when I apply for the job
there would be so many candidates say
around 3040 minimum or maybe hundred so
how should i what should I do
whom should I get in touch with somebody
who knows me or somehow knows that I
have done work before and I can really
take care of it how do I go through that
through that maze and get to the right
person so that has been always at the
back of my mind how should I do it how
should I approach because you know
referrals are a huge deal a great deal
and really putting you forward so that
has been at the back of my mind how what
when so these are the questions that's
right yeah let's investigate that
mystery let's get to the end of that
maze so basically the way it works is
that the data shows you're ten times
more likely to get an interview based on
a referral than just applying online
which is why it's important to get but
in terms of how you actually get it what
you're gonna do is tap into the network
that you've been building steadily on
LinkedIn all along okay so coming up
here to the top you're gonna say hey I
want to see all the folks that I know at
say William Sonoma so here we go and
notice I'm taking a close your cahier
you'll become quite familiar with this
as you go along but if you want to have
a really fast search on LinkedIn just
type in the parameter in this case
company okay : and then whatever the
search search query is okay okay so five
thousand people in Sonoma great how many
do I know personally and LinkedIn
parlance how many of my first-degree
connections uh-oh no results right and
this is gonna be typical right you know
especially for breaking into new
industry or tolling you space you're
gonna see that more often than not this
is where most job seekers give up okay
I've probably even 90% which is crazy
because which is a little additional
detective work you can break on through
okay let me show you how so what you can
do is you can say okay I may not know
anyone there personally but there are
many other roads in for instance is
there anyone who is at William Sonoma
who has a shared affiliation around
school so we can come up here and say
company William Sonoma and then add in
Udacity and check out some of these
results here and sure enough there's
this guy Lokesh who is actually a
Udacity alum he has a front-end web
developer named degree so it might be a
really nice time to reach out to him and
say hey Udacity indeed a.cian
might we have a chance to grab coffee
and sort of talk about you know what
it's like working at William Sonoma so
that's one possibility
my god I'm so excited to know this this
was something that I didn't know before
and I was always thinking of how to
reach somebody who is in that company so
this is such a
the thing that he told me it's like it
really really would be very helpful
absolutely and I think it's one of those
things where like Udacity is relatively
new compared to the like the Stanford's
and the birthdays of the world but
because it's so massive there are
already tons of alumni out there and
that it actually gives you entree to a
really powerful Network so that's one
possibility what about the volunteer
piece is there someone who possibly
worked for the Sierra Club who also
works there now sure enough a senior
editor and e-commerce closely related to
social media also has a Sierra Club
background and so that's someone we can
tap into in terms of really great
opportunities so we're gonna do a quick
search for that
sure enough Sierra Club outings 2012
trip guide yeah great thing to bring up
in terms of their initial outreach email
absolutely I'm so excited to know this
this aspect of job search I I didn't
know this before yeah I think this is
one of those things where it's not even
about the technology mm-hmm it's about
human technology right the fact that
we're so tribal at the at the end of the
day where if we know someone shared an
experience with us where there was
online or whether they're volunteering
or school yes powerful yeah and you
already feel connected to that person
you know you might have shared the same
goal or same mission or same passion so
yeah absolutely and there's no reason
not to leverage that so that's all well
and good in terms of things that you
directly have in common one other very
important approach and this is not even
just tribal this is exponential is the
fact that again if you have a thousand
connections in LinkedIn or even 100
connections on LinkedIn and each of them
also has a hundred now we're talking
about 10,000 potential connections that
you could leverage and so if you come
over here and say show me not
first-degree connections is
williams-sonoma
but second-degree all of a sudden are 29
folks we can get in touch with who knows
someone that we know right and we can
ask that mutual connection hey Sara hey
robb would you mind putting me in touch
with this person over there right and
now again there's that feeling of
loyalty and sort of responsibility where
if her friend is asking you do a favor
you typically do it right so another way
to get your foot in the door great point
okay so any of those things will
hopefully lead to a referral you're
gonna
then to them you know here's my
background here's what I can do for you
and then in many cases they're actually
gonna get a bonus if you're hired as a
referral so it's totally a win-win
mm-hmm very very powerful way to get
your foot in the door okay
now let's talk about those last two
stages here all right so let's imagine
that you've identified this great role
you've gone after at full force you may
be met with three different people
through different avenues and two of
them are putting the good word for you
okay you're almost guaranteed of an
interview at that point right because
we're crew doesn't want to let down
their colleagues now how do you make
sure that you maximize that interview
opportunity have you had any like good
or bad interview experiences over the
years oh I have I've had a couple of
interviews even while I finish the
course and it's been both you know if
you if you talk about it has both facets
good because you get an experience and
you know areas where you lag maybe you
need to do a little more and bad yeah um
yeah maybe you know you feel that maybe
you need to add some skill sets or your
communication skills or something
there's some lag somewhere where in you
need to really make up and do work for
that so yeah I have had those
experiences with with interviews before
cool cool yeah I think one of those the
big challenges I think that you can add
this in your experience is it's tough to
walk in cold as a total outsider yes
yeah if you're new to the company and
you do the role you can almost feel like
you're walking into an ambush you know
that you really want to work for that
organization but you think are you
really you know going parallely with
what they really want is that is that
something that you're getting across to
them so these are the things that you
keep thinking about after you are done
with the interview that you know really
did I put myself up there and was I
matching with the company goals and my
own passion was I getting a close
connection between the two so all these
things you know you keep wondering about
yeah as you said yeah and I want you to
walk in there next time not as an
outsider but already as an insider
someone with the conference to say hey
I've along here and here's how to get
that so obviously you can search for the
individual people that you're going to
interview with on LinkedIn try to figure
out if you have anything in common
well you can talk about in terms of
those questions you might want to ask at
the end of the interview but you also
want to check out the company right and
there are three ways you can do that so
you can look for the company itself in
terms of coming up here and say hey let
me see their company page and this is
useful not so much in terms of see
Kurt nuggets okay just to understand
their language in their style how do
they talk about themselves how do they
carry themselves publicly try to match
that in your style in your language but
if you want to go a little deeper there
are a couple things you can do so yeah
we're gonna search for William Sonoma
and check out what we do this time I
just hit the Return button on my
keyboard as opposed to clicking their
link and now I can actually search for
content related to them so LinkedIn
pulls in all this great content from
across the web they're owning a West Elm
this is what's happening in the retail
space all these trends in their industry
in their company you couldn't actually
find on your own one by one but it's all
aggregator for you care right right
let's go one step even further so if you
go over to this off neglected tab work
over here on the far right yeah and go
to SlideShare okay SlideShare is
basically the YouTube and PowerPoint if
you will okay all the powerpoints of the
world in one place right and one of the
cool things about SlideShare is people
have actually done typically for like
business school or academic kind of
projects analyses of all the companies
in the world practically alright and so
if you were to come here and say hey
williams-sonoma sort of analysis you
know could be competitive analysis or
SWOT analysis sure enough you're gonna
see all this good stuff whether it's
strategy or financial information people
have already crunched for you and you
can review ahead of time to again feel
like that insider oh wow this is
wonderful
never use that that tab at all yeah yeah
so definitely it has good value
especially when you're ready for sort of
being in the spotlight and doing your
best right yeah and now let's fast
forward one final stage I think you've
always talked about visualizing success
right thinking about how it's gonna feel
when you cross the finish line let's
think about how it's gonna feel when you
get the offer I feel I want to do there
okay wonderful hey we're making a magic
happen here you can say hey I'm just
gonna take any old offer they throw at
me I'm just so excited going to the
space you know that's fine it's fine to
say hey like I'm just thrilled to be
there and I want to sort of build up my
credibility over time but you can also
say hey I'm a really good talented
professional I've been working as a
marketer for a while and I've actually
developed interesting experiences I
should be paid what I'm worth but how do
you know yeah and so the reason it the
reason that I recommend this next tool
is it'll actually give you that
information
that'll give you the power to walk into
that conversation with leverage mm-hmm
so obviously it's always a good idea to
have multiple offers if possible which
is why I like the idea of applying
probably as we talked about before
so you can use that as leverage but even
if you don't have that you can go to
LinkedIn salary tool and you can use the
leverage of data and knowledge and say
hey show me what social media managers
are getting paid in the Bay Area and
it's not even just sort of a high level
like number like seventy one thousand
seventy five thousand but it's actually
broken down by industries so if you want
to get into say consumer goods like
William Sonoma versus the tech world by
years of experience all the way down to
how much stock would you expect the size
of the company all that good stuff and
that way when you had that back and
forth of the recruiter about what the
right amount is you don't have to be
content but sort of take what they gave
you you can say well you know this is
what the market rate is and I think a
market rate is favor and usually that's
gonna get you into their good graces
because that's the world that they deal
with they deal with sort of what's out
there what the market is a reality in
terms of the labor market and this will
empower you to make those kinds of
course yeah yeah this is good yeah
this is good to know because you keep
thinking when you are up for an
interview you keep thinking what is what
is a good pay for that role is the right
pace so you keep thinking about various
aspects of that area so this is a good
thing to know and find out from so you
get a ballpark figure of what to say or
way to start with that's right yeah just
level the playing field right yes it
does and then lastly obviously you've
made their promised land now you got the
dream job the dream salary but what I
really want to talk about is any
lingering concerns you have like
anything else it might be a roadblock to
getting there oh the roadblock to
getting this this first thing that comes
to my mind is in terms of skill sets
which I think I have that do you feel
that I need to add something while I'm
looking for a job search like a lot of
times when you go through the the job
roles or the job responsibilities there
are certain things that you think or you
know that you don't have so yeah the
other good question is how much should I
say a profile I match 50
sent with that profile which is up there
should I apply for that job or should I
not and the second part of this is
should I keep increasing my skill set
should I keep adding value to myself so
yeah that's something that I would want
to ask you yeah absolutely I think this
is a case where again a lot of job
seekers talk themselves out of roles
that they would actually be really good
for if we go back to that job
description so for example looking at
the William Sonoma job what we're gonna
find is that it's a pretty lengthy job
description which is not surprising
because they typically are right so
let's check it out here at the very
bottom and if I'm not mistaken there's
probably at least 20 bullet points here
right yeah gotta have this gotta have
that almost like have to be like a
unicorn right one perfect candidate
across the world and I think what this
speaks to is the fact that recruiters
are working really hard inside
organizations to satisfy multiple
stakeholders hiring managers across
functional partners everyone's got sort
of a voice in that opinion and so
they're sort of putting everything down
there but the reality is no one in the
world is gonna have all of that not even
the world's most experienced social
media marketers and so don't let don't
let yourself be talked out by that sort
of inner voice like oh no I don't have
this one thing I'm done because no one
ever gets hired for matching everything
as long as you can meet that minimum
level and I think 50% is probably a
pretty good amount I think you're gonna
be in good shape
the other thing to answer the question
about what skills you should develop is
look for patterns across the jobs that
you really admire okay so we've only
looked at one job today but if you look
to the William Sonoma job and the
Pottery Barn job and the post mates job
and the line bike job and you're saying
the same skills over and over and over
again whether it's Photoshop or
HootSuite or what have you
maybe that's telling you hey to be
successful in the space this is
fundamental this is a common denominator
but don't go don't go crazy and try to
develop a skill because you saw once on
one JavaScript absolutely that's another
question there's so many things that
sometimes you feel that I should do this
may be Photoshop or HTML or something
things like that which you keep thinking
that I should add but it's a whole huge
gamut of things that that you need to
add and then it kind of bogs you down
that what should I do now
so yes yeah yeah your ideas would be
really helpful if you could tell me yeah
and I think one of the things I think
about too is like how
all gonna play out in the interview room
if you can get that referral you're
almost guaranteed an interview and if
you can get into the interview room you
can win not based on some abstract
skillset that you have but I'm the fact
that you're gonna build an emotional
connection with that interviewer right
so that's another human on the other
side of the table it might seem like an
interviewing robot they might be playing
it very sort of poker-faced
but underneath that facade they want
someone who can not only do the job who
they want to do the job with and if you
can bring that same personality I'm
singing right now in terms of you know
someone who's excited and passion about
the space great collaborator that's
gonna be just as important as checking
off a million different boxes I agree
absolutely and I think in that in that
context the the company search and there
the details about the company as you
showed me would be very important
because then you can associate and align
yourself and you actually know what what
you're doing or what you want to do and
you can gaze you're kind of passion for
that area so I think that whole thing
will get that empathetic value also
towards across the table when you are
there for the interview for that company
or for that role or for the value
proposition that you put in that's right
it just feels like you believe it yes
yeah absolutely any other questions I I
think you just covered I mean whatever
was there in my mind I think everything
has been answered and there were certain
things that was like like a magic you
know magic happening as you told me to
to do the network of you know analysis
as to how you can go through the second
degree network connections and know
people or maybe through your volunteer
work or projects or or education so that
was great I didn't know about that at
all and that's something that I was
really looking forward to how do I build
typically for somebody who was in a
career transition stage and who was kind
of trying to get the foot into the door
in that domain this was this was so
helpful Cocco yeah well I mean let me
just recap a couple things for our
audience out there and then we'll open
it up to questions there so just to
remember what we just did here we went
through seven steps number one do you
identify the perfect role for her not
just an industry or a high-level passion
but actually the specific area where she
could add value for the recruiter in the
hiring manager so I was a great place to
begin then she positioned her LinkedIn
profile her resume for that by matching
the job description in terms of the
headline and the specific skills they
were looking for then she moved on to
build her network number
three so actually adding her address
books to LinkedIn to make sure she had a
powerful network out there ready to go
number four she automated her java
search I mean the computer handled the
emotions of the up and down ups and down
day to day caps fresh jobs coming in
which he could number five apply for
regularly and get the referral for each
one of them by finding people on the
inside either they had a shared
educational background volunteer
experience or even second degree
connections friends of friends right
number six she got ready for the
interview with great inside our research
looking at things like SlideShare and
the content feed on lead in and at
number seven when she got the job she
got ready to negotiate with a LinkedIn
salary feature so I think if you can
start to apply some of those same steps
in your own career this new year you're
gonna have a very successful 2018 and to
help you out we'd love to take your
questions right now all right well I
want to thank you dear because you were
awesome today and I'm wishing you
tremendous success launching your career
here I also want to let the folks out
there know that there are two things you
can really do above and beyond what
we've talked about today to get your own
career ready for success in 2018 number
one you can definitely take advantage of
that LinkedIn alumni network for Udacity
it's gonna be really reinvigorated this
year losing the lots opportunities there
have you checked it out to you I need to
do that ok yeah definitely get on there
let's do that and then number two one of
the things that's really unique to view
to ask the experience especially as an
alum is you can take advantage of all
the great career resources inside our
classroom yeah make sure you have that
LinkedIn profile review get support
you're definitely not alone in this
process okay
great point because I missed that out I
did start doing that but I think
somewhere down the line I didn't
complete that so I would look forward to
doing that I think I should do that
absolutely and as soon as possible that
would be really nice yeah very cool well
I think you're right you're gonna be
super successful doing it and I hope
everyone else out there
avail themselves of those resources as
well they're pretty special so here's
wishing you guys a tremendous new year
yeah happy new year a lot of success to
everybody thank you
okay we're super excited to take your
questions everyone so we're gonna start
with some questions coming in to the
live stream please don't hesitate to
chat more and as we go I want to have as
many questions out there
get you ready for a new year full of
success to kick things off we're gonna
start with a question about data science
so someone's asking I'm an astronomer
transitioning to data science should I
put astronomer in the job field on my
LinkedIn page astronomer data scientist
or just data scientist
that's a great question Lauren so what
I'm gonna recommend is that you want to
focus a hundred percent of LinkedIn
about where you want to go not where
you've been and the reason for that is
you've got to think about what
recruiters think about which is will you
be able to come in here and make a big
impact in this job that I'm hiring for
they don't necessarily care if you've
been a kindergarten teacher or an
architect or an astronomer so much is
that you can hit the ground running on
day one and make them look like a star
and so if you're applying for data
science roles that's what I lead with on
your headline great question okay next
we're gonna move to a question from
Robin Robin says I'm a 40 year old
career changer with varied prior
experience I feel my lack of
professional programming experience and
formal qualifications is met with
skepticism by recruiters however I do
feel confident my bill you'll learn
quickly how can we encourage companies
to have wildcards such as myself a
chance and I totally empathize Robin I
think anyone is going through the
difficult process of career change
understands exactly how daunting it is
not just psychologically but then
regarding the world and face rejection
after rejection and so what I'm going to
suggest to you building on my last
answer is that you want to make it hard
for the recruiters to say no and easy
for them to say yes and there are three
ways that you do that so number one you
want to position yourself in a way that
just smooths all the friction out of the
system if you're a recruiter and you
come across a resume that says again
astronomer strange background something
that's irrelevant for the job it's easy
to say no to that thing this person
doesn't fit my mental model of who this
person should be whereas if you're
possess
from the headline to your summary all
the way down to your job experience
talks about the exact skills that are
needed in this role and the exact job
title that you're shooting for
well now based on the recruiters
screening methods you seem like the
exact right person in the exact right
place and that's why positioning get you
past the first screen but now the
recruiters gonna go a little deeper
they're gonna say okay this person looks
really great on a superficial level
they're saying the right things but can
they walk the talk and that's where the
second step of portfolio comes in the
second P if you will with a portfolio
approach you say not am I only a data
scientist or a software developer or
whatever you need me to be for this
given role but I can back it up with
actual experience and now you might be
thinking yourself how do I do that I
don't actually have that experience it
feels like chicken to the egg I want the
experience will only give me a shot
getting the experience if I already have
the experience how do you break through
well the answer is you build out a
portfolio of your work through side
projects it could be something as simple
as doing your own startup or your own
little application where you can sort of
show off your own development skills or
design skills or data skills it could be
working for a start-up on a relatively
limited freelance basis it could even be
volunteering with a charity that needs
your technical ability through a site
like katchafire org however you do it
whether it's on your own through a
start-up through a non-profit you're
gonna build out a portfolio of expertise
that you can say hey definitively I can
do this job because seeing is believing
and here's my portfolio to prove it and
the last piece after positioning in
portfolio is number three professional
networking and that's the ability to say
hey not only I'm in the right person for
the job with the right experience but I
know the right people who can vouch for
me and again you might be thinking well
Jeremy that sounds all well and good but
I'm totally new in this industry
I'm totally new in the city potentially
how do I make my way in this world and
the way you do that is by finding any
possible pathway any possible connection
that will get your foot in the door so
for example as we talked about in Diaz
case if you go on LinkedIn you'll find
out that maybe you don't know anyone at
that given company but maybe you have
someone who works there who went to your
alma mater or who worked at a former
company with you
or even volunteers of the same
organization maybe they're a friend of a
friend or a second-degree connection
Lincoln's parlance whatever the case
make sure that you reach out to that
person based on that shared affiliation
and ask them to help you ask them to
leverage that tribal connection that
alliance that you have again get your
foot in the door and get a referral to
get you on the recruiters radar if you
can do those three things really well
number one position yourself number two
build a portfolio and number three
professionally network you can overcome
any challenges even the most adverse
recruiter and make it easy for them to
say yes all right let's move on to the
next question here so question from
Lauren what can I do if I don't know
anyone in the industry to give me a
reference to flag my resume and I just
comparing crickets which is never sound
you want to hear when you're job
searching well we've already talked
about a lot of the ways in whether it's
through educational connections or
volunteer connections or friends or
friends but what I also want to talk
about is the bold move of reaching out
directly to a hiring manager so let's
imagine a case where you have a really
great job that you're totally gung ho
for and you're feeling completely stuck
because you've gone through Jeremy's
crazy laundry list of connection
possibilities and you're still striking
out what are you doing that case if
you're bold and you're confident you
believe in yourself what are you gonna
do is you're gonna figure out who the
hiring manager is not the recruiter
who's that gatekeeper trying to stand
between you and your dream job but the
person who ultimately will benefit from
hiring you onto their team and working
with you for great success because
that's a win-win kind of relationship so
you go on LinkedIn you'll search for the
company and the team and the function
and you'll figure out who's the boss for
that area that's the hiring manager
that's the person that's ultimately
gonna make the call on whether you get
the job or not and you're gonna reach
out to them directly
and you're gonna say here's who I am
again using good positioning here's what
I've done again based on your portfolio
and then here's what I can do for you
here's how I can solve your you need
your unique problems and make your job
easier if you can do those things you
may not get a response every time but
you certainly will sometimes and having
that ultimate decision-maker know what
you can do for them is going to make all
the difference in
job search so please please please do
not give up even if you don't see
opportunities for networking right off
the bat let's move on to a question from
the NIA Sonia says I'm 38 and I want to
switch to a web development career after
having worked in the development sector
overseas for 17 years I finished the
course at Udacity congratulations I'm
taking another course as well what would
be the best job application strategy for
me and so what I'm gonna say is building
on the strategies we've already talked
about about positioning and portfolio
and all of that what I also want to
recommend as I recommend this idea is to
apply broadly if you're breaking into a
field one of the initial rookie mistakes
that I see made over and over again and
I've certainly made myself many times is
to approach it very timidly say I'm a
little anxious a little concerned about
my ability to do well in this space
maybe I'll fail just one application
well sure enough you get denied on that
one application and now you're done you
say you know what I just can't take this
rejection I'm out of here I'm gonna try
something else when in fact the winning
strategy is to put multiple irons into
the fire set up automated job alerts on
LinkedIn or in deed or angel list if
you're interested in startups let those
come into your inbox on a regular basis
and then apply to those as soon as
possible so you get that Christmas
present benefit then we were talking
about with Dia in the interview then
after you started to apply for those
jobs continue to network deeply find
people on the inside it can refer you
and what you're gonna find is that over
time you build a momentum so now you've
got an interview here and an interview
there and before you know it a company
is on the fence about you thinking
should we bring this person in so we
give them an offer and you say to that
company well guess what I have three
other interviews and two offers already
lined up do you want me or not and now
you've changed the fundamental equation
of the job search instead of being sort
of the the lonely person who's looking
for opportunities that the really cool
awesome company now the companies are
competing for you now you're the prize
and that's my momentum and volume are so
important to the job search all right
let's talk about a really fundamental
question that Multan leave last vinícius
simone folks them around the world we're
saying Oh
I keep seeing these job descriptions
Jeremy where it talks about bachelor's
degree in computer science master's
degree in computer science PhD in
computer science you see it so often
that it's scarring your retinas you're
having bad dreams in the middle of the
night about job descriptions that are
demanding things you don't have what do
you do in that situation and again I'm
gonna go back to this idea that the
power to change your career
fundamentally resides within you not
within the recruiter not within some
outside force and the way that you can
take control of that is by ignoring all
that now they're very well be maybe jobs
where they're so technical or so
specific that they want someone with
this particular pedigree but the vast
majority of jobs in my experience are
open to the people who can do them
really well no matter their background
in every industry and every occupation
you're gonna find people who don't have
the PhD or even the college degree and
they're doing those jobs at the top of
their game because they're fundamentally
good at and they're passionate about and
the way that I imagine you are and the
way that they got those jobs was not the
traditional road of just filling out an
application hoping for the best but
ultimately again winning over that
hiring manager who says at the end of
the day I don't care about your pedigree
I just need someone who can do the job
well that's gonna be an awesome
colleague and if that's you it behooves
you to reach out to that person and
strip away the recruiter and strip away
the requirements and not let those block
you what I would also say is that
ultimately if you think about from the
recruiters perspective so many of those
requirements are purely for their
convenience if you're a recruiter for a
really cool company and you're gonna get
a thousand applications for a given job
you want to throw as many requirements
out there to make it easy to reject
people well if I move the bar from a
bachelors to masters now I can knock out
half that pool and there are fewer
resumes to read but does that have
anything to do with the job itself
absolutely not and that's why you can't
let the recruiters convenience get in
the way of getting the job of your
dreams next up a question about changing
careers but not having the experience
you need this was a question that came
from William and Siva and multiple
others around the world and basically
what I'm gonna recommend here similarly
what we've already talked about with the
portfolio approach of the
get stuck in that chicken and the egg
conundrum that catch-22 of needing
experience but not being able to access
the experience you need to get the job
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
step outside of that conundrum and
you're gonna build that experience on
your own and that's the beauty of the
kinds of skills and experiences that you
gasps a teaches it's not theoretical
it's not something where you have to say
well I could take a test on it to prove
it to you these are the kinds of skills
whether it's developments or AI or
digital marketing where you can prove
those out through your own work and
again it could be first start up of your
own doing it could be a first side
project helping a friend volunteering
for a non-profit working with a start-up
as a freelancer going to a site like
upwork.com
and listening yourself as a volunteer
all of those pathways gave you access to
building out a rich portfolio of
experience that ultimately proves you
can do the job and not just that you've
checked off all the right boxes so make
sure that you don't be so sort of beaten
back by those kinds of requirements
around five to seven years of this or
three to five years of that if you can
find him I only do the job prove it and
then show it to the hiring manager okay
a couple of additional questions here so
Siva says I am a technology consultant
with a decade of experience I'm
passionate about AI autonomous vehicles
and I completed the self-driving car
Indy which is awesome can you mentor me
I'm making the career transition well of
course you see if I have hung up my own
career coaching Spurs so to speak then
work full-time at Udacity to make a big
splash for our students here however I
have an even better resource for you
this may not be known to many alumni out
there but it definitely should be which
is the fact that alumni have access to
career coaching resources after their
nanodegree ends so if you check out your
Udacity classroom or any of the other
alumni materials what you'll find is
that you can reach out to our awesome
rock star career team here for help with
resumes profiles cover letters
interviewing tips everything you need to
get out of your rut and get that job of
your dreams so please don't sit on the
sidelines even one day longer avail
yourself of those resources because we
really do want to help and we're
standing by and ready to do that okay
question from Joyce Amino Joyce says
what is the best way to show your
projects on LinkedIn for example one of
your projects that you did in the
digital marketing edge of your program
to use the site like Dropbox do you
download it what's the best way well
we're gonna probably sound like a bit of
a broken record here Joe after
everything that we talked about in the
interview but I'm gonna say you want
that up on LinkedIn and the reason for
that is because if it's on Dropbox or if
it's on your hard drive or if it's
sitting printed out somewhere that does
you absolutely no good because no one
can see it
it's hidden away from the world whereas
if you've been bedded on your LinkedIn
profile you now have a 24/7
advertisement for you and your abilities
live to recruiters and hiring managers
around the world so go to LinkedIn go to
the experience that's related to it or
the project that's related to it and
just say attach rich media and you can
upload a PDF a PowerPoint a Word
document anything else that really
represents the great work that you've
done and now it's on display for the
world to see and that's gonna give you a
lot of access to opportunities where you
didn't even know they existed so make
sure it's available to the world and the
world will respond great question
all right we have just one more question
left here so this is coming from Paul
Paul says I've changed my career to be
an Android developer but there's not
many openings for me because I live here
in the Dominican Republic what's the
best way to deal with this well what I
would say is that if you are truly
passionate about this space you are
actually a lucky man Paul and the reason
for that is in this day and age with the
skills that you've developed through
Udacity you can actually work for pretty
much any cool company anywhere and the
reason for that is your skills can be
applied from the DR to any company's
projects worldwide so whether it's
through a site like we work remotely or
going to a site like in deed and
searching for remote jobs you're gonna
find thousands of thousands of
opportunities that are explicitly open
to folks with your exact skills anywhere
in the world and while it may seem a
little bit tricky at first they build
those relationships and get the ball
rolling once you've established your
spell from the space chances are others
are going to want to hire you too
and what we see here at Udacity and
other companies around Silicon Valley is
a tremendous amount of our workforce
isn't actually based here it's
fundamentally too expensive to be here
what they are they are is all around the
world doing this cool cutting-edge work
whether it's in Beijing Mumbai or
anywhere else and so if you've got that
passion if you've got those skills
don't let geography or be a blocker go
out there and go for those remote roles
because they're absolutely out there
okay we have two minutes left so we're
hitting on one last question from AJ and
this is actually probably the most
foundational question of them all so I'm
glad we can tackle this thank you for
asking AJ which is how do I stop that
self-doubt and focus on my new career
path and I think this is one of those
things that can't be solved with
LinkedIn or clever marketing strategies
or even positioning this is something
that has to start inside because you're
right if you're consumed with self-doubt
if you're paralyzed by a concern that
you just don't belong in this space
imposter syndrome as we call it it's
hard to take even the first step and so
what I would do is I would start by
actually building something really cool
I would prove to yourself that you are
absolutely a rock star in the space
whether you're in dev or in marketing or
what-have-you
do a project that demonstrates not just
the world but to you but you absolutely
can't hack it in this world you belong
in this tribe if you can do that you'll
not only show to yourself what's
possible but you'll be take the first
step in building out that portfolio
that'll be so important as you go out to
recruiters and hiring managers around
the world so I would start there and
then the last thing I would mention as I
surround myself with a group of people
who fundamentally believe in you whether
they're friends and family or people
that you network with who are already in
the space if you can build that social
momentum around your career search so
it's not just you and your lonesome that
sad person climbing up a mountain all by
themself but a team of Mountaineers who
are embarking on this great journey
together who can accomplish wonderful
things with that shared sense of
accountability you're gonna get much
much further together than you would
alone and again in doing so you have
also compost the next step of building
that professional network you need to
land that dream job
so start by proving to yourself that you
absolutely belong and then build that
group of fellow travelers who will carry
you all the way to the promised land
if you can do that you'll be successful
not only your job search but in whatever
adventure comes next
