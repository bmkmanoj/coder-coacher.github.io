about it but let me just kind of go
top-down so here's what I'm thinking I
think the same principle applies where
you sort of want to ask the question
that gives you the maximum amount of
information and from the teachers point
of view I might be able to pick a
question that gives you the answer right
away depending upon what H is and what X
is but from the learners point of view I
sort of can so what does the learner
know so when we ask a question X it's
going to either have a yes answer or no
answer and let's say that at any given
point in time we have n possible people
that we're trying to reason about and
then after we choose X after we choose
the question if the answer is yes then
we're gonna have I don't know some other
number of people say L and if the answer
is no then it's gonna be n minus L right
and so you said that in the case of the
teacher pick a question so that this yes
is going to whittle it down so that this
is just going to be the one right answer
that's exactly right
but that's assuming that X is set up in
such a way that you could ask that kind
of question basically a question can be
of the form is it this or this or this
or this or this
any pattern of answers that we want we
can construct the corresponding question
okay that makes sense to me and I don't
think it changes my thought process so
so that's good so I always want to ask
the question that's gonna give me
maximal information
I'm the learner I don't know everything
like the teacher does but what I do know
are all of my hypotheses right so I know
how each hypothesis responds to each of
the questions so in general it seems to
me that I should try to eliminate as
many hypotheses as I can okay that makes
sense yeah I write that down I like that
now you could say that's what the
teacher did but let's take what the
teacher did the teacher knew that there
was a hypothesis where it would Whittle
it down that it since the answer was yes
it would will it down to one but if the
answer had been no it would have only
gotten rid of one so since the teacher
knew the answer the teacher could pick
that question but as a learner I don't
know the answer so finding questions
that whittle it down to one if the
answer is yes aren't very helpful
because the answer might be no all right
so how many let's see so under the
assumption the target hypothesis was
chosen from each say uniformly at random
right
it's the expected number of hypotheses
we can eliminate with a question that
has this form
well it's binary so if you assume that
the hypothesis covers everything about
the space covers everything then the
best you can do is eliminate about half
of them on average well so but in
particular if you have a question like
this X that you know you asked it when
there's n possible people and then after
you ask it if the answer is yes you're
at L possible people and otherwise
you're at n minus L which branch are we
gonna go down well we don't know it
could be either one aha but can we put a
probability on it yes if it covers
everything it's about a half and a half
you said it was uniform right uniformly
chosen the the right answer the the
target person is uniformly chosen but
this question isn't isn't mr. Li of that
form right this this question could be
very skewed it might only have one thing
on the left and then -1 on the right
like you said right well then I that's
not a very good question to ask no
that's right but I want to I want to be
able to distinguish good from bad
questions by saying we want questions
that that are gonna leave us with the
smallest expected size set Oh
well then since all possibilities are
there the smallest the the best you can
hope for is about 1/2
yeah and in particular what this quote
this particular question is going to do
is it's gonna have a probability of n
over L of going down the left branch and
getting an L and it's gonna have a
probability of n minus L over N of going
down the right branch and getting n
minus L and so that could be one way of
actually scoring this this question the
question that has the best score as you
pointed out is going to be one where L
is about the same as n minus L in fact
half would be a really good choice right
I thought that's what I said yeah ok
good but I just wanted to write down the
formula okay that means since that makes
it okay that's always good to write down
the formula okay so you want to pick
questions that roughly split things in
half and if you can do that every single
time then every single time you will
split the set in half so you'll start
out with n then n over 2 then in over 4
then in over 8 then and over and
eventually you'll get to n over n which
will give you 1 you'll only have one
possible answer and so that'll take you
a logarithm amount of time right so the
number of times you can divide a number
in half before you get down to 1 is
exactly the log base 2 so if we start
out with size of H hypotheses it'll take
it's like log base two to whittle it
down to a single question this is a lot
larger I mean this is a nice small
number but it's a lot larger than one
right you know one one is really great
this is you know exponentially no this
is much much worse than one but but it's
still really good you can you know it's
not considering all the hypotheses it's
very cleverly whittling it down so that
it only has to look at the log of that
