to include between these parentheses
include read/write read-only and copy
notice that for the house class we
declared our properties in the header
file the public interface so right now
if I go into the main function notice
that i'm outside of the house class but
i can get ahold of an instance of house
and change its number of bedrooms for
example let's say we wanted to limit
that access we could start by declaring
number of bedrooms in the implementation
file so that its private so we switch
over to the dot M file and weary declare
number of bedrooms and we mark this
private implementation with the property
attribute read/write read/write means
what it sounds like from inside the
class one can read or write to this
variable then we switch back to the dot
H file and we marked this version of the
property as read-only naturally read
only means that one can read the value
of the property but not right to it
notice that if i go back to the main
function i can access the number of
bedrooms from outside the class but I
don't have to worry about accidentally
changing it if I try to write to this
property the compiler won't allow it
you can think of read write and read
only as being similar to VAR and let and
Swift read/write is akin to defining
something as a variable and read only is
akin to defining something as a constant
since our address property is an NS
string we're going to want to market
with the property attribute copy in
general you want to use copy for strings
to understand why
let's see what happens when we don't
mark the address with copy here we are
in the main function of the house class
and in this line we're creating a string
that's holding an address
now we're going to use that address to
initialize an instance of the house
class my house if we log the address of
my house to the console we see 555 Park
Avenue cool now let's say some Joker's
writing test code and they append the
string lala land to the address string
variable notice that we never accessed
my house don't address the second
I'm but if we log the current value of
my house not addressed to the console we
see 555 park avenue la la land so that's
no good
we don't want to leave properties of our
classes vulnerable to unintentional
changes right now we are initializing
the address property with a pointer to
address string we can fix this problem
by initializing the address property
with its own independent copy of address
string so we'll go back to our house dot
H file will mark a dress with copy and
then run the program again you can see
that this time the value of my house
dotted dress doesn't change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
