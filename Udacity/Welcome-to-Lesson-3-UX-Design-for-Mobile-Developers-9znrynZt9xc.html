your neck oh I heard it um I actually
have a slightly limited range of motion
and so I can only move this way kind of
like a robot
oh no they live Android sounds like you
have a constraint I know it is a
constraint but instead of fighting
against it I'm gonna totally embrace it
and work with it
well actually this lesson is all about
how to work within constraints and
deliver great user experiences so you're
actually right at home I know that's
awesome let's get started
so in lesson two we taught you some
tools called personas and use cases that
allow you to better prioritize your
feature list and make really good
applications and you also learned a
little bit about UX research and in
Lesson one we taught you about a low res
wireframing which helps you think about
the big picture first before you go into
things like flows and details and UI
elements so knows well let's talk about
what you're going to learn in lesson
three okay in this lesson you'll learn
how to design for the mobile user and
how this is different from designing for
a web or a desktop user you'll also
learn about four mobile constraints that
you need to keep in mind for any mobile
apps that you build then you'll learn
more about wire framing picking up from
where we left off in Lesson one we're
going to go deeper into how to design a
flow of screens to support each step
inside your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
