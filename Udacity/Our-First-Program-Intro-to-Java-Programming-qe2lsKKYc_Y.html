modifications of our first program and I
hope you found that you can make changes
to the program without actually
understanding all of the bits and pieces
but still it's a good idea to have a
closer look and know the lay of the land
first off as I've said before these two
lines are pretty routine pronouncements
that you have to do with every program
and most programmers don't think about
it very much you know it's like when
you're on an airplane and the flight
attendant says we're about to leave
put all your seats in the upright
position put the tray tables back turn
your cellphone's off and most people
just don't even pay much attention to
those things anymore
it's worth noting the word main here
that means it's the main entry point
into the program it's worth noting the
name of the program here and all the
other things are kind of noise for us
right now
let's focus on the important statement
text like this that's enclosed in
quotation marks is called a string
that's just a technical term for the
text this statement here prints the
string and the exercise with Sara you've
seen that one can also print numbers if
you put a number or a mathematical
expression inside the parenthesis then
that gets printed system dot out over
here is technically called an object as
you'll see in the next lesson objects
are things that do work for us in a
programming language this particular
object represents the terminal window
the window in which a string or a number
is printed when printing does its job
finally this part is called a method
we'll talk much more about methods in
the next lesson for right now just think
of it as an instruction that's being
executed as you can tell from this part
of the name the instruction is to print
something on the terminal window
what's with the Ln back here that says
that it should also be prepared to make
the next printout appear over here so if
we first print
hmm hello world and then we print three
plus four plus five that printout will
appear here on the next line without the
Ln that doesn't make the next printout
appear on a new line you'll practice
working with both of these methods with
Sarah in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
