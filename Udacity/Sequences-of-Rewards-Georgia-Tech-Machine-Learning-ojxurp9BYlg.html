so all I've done is I have replaced the
equation at the top with an alternate
version of the equation okay it looks so
it looks like there's you're now
exponentially blowing up the reward ah I
am NOT exponentially blowing up the
reward instead what I've done is I've
added up the seat the rewards that I'm
going to see for the states that I'm
going to see and I multiply 2 by gamma
to the T but gamma is between 0 &amp;amp; 1 ah I
see so well kind of so so it doesn't
exponentially blow up it exponentially
implodes right so things that are like a
thousand steps in the future if we
multiply if we take something that's
less than 1 and we raise it to that
power it goes essentially to 0 so it's
like it starts off the rewards are kind
of substantial and then they get they
just they trail off quickly right and in
fact we can write down mathematically
what this is if you actually if you
stared at it long enough and you
remembered your intermediate algebra or
calculus or wherever it is you learn
this stuff you would probably recognize
this as a special kind of sequence or
series do you remember what it is
television series no but that's
remarkably close so let's see if we can
bound this particular equation so we
know that this version of the equation
eventually ends up being infinity if all
the rewards are positive right so what
does this end up being even in the case
where all the rewards are positive well
we can bound this from above by the
largest reward that we will ever see in
the following way so all I've done is
said well I don't know what the rewards
are but there is some maximum reward
imma call it R max and if I pretended
that I always got the R max reward so on
that's a long as that's an actual number
a finite number I know that this is
bounded from above by this expression
well what does this look like maybe this
does look like a series you remember
geometric series yes this is the
geometric series and this is exactly
equal to this and I assumed that the
summation causes the max to become
lowercase yes yes it does that's a
that's a trick that they don't really go
over deeply in calculus but it's true
oh that's cool all right so it's the
reward the maximum award divided by one
minus gamma so when gamma is really
close to zero you're just getting oh
you're getting just that one reward in
the beginning and then everything falls
off to nothing after that and if gamma
is really close to one you're dividing
by something that's teeny-tiny which
actually is like multiplying it by
something that's really big so it kind
of magnifies the reward out but it's not
infinity until gamma gets all the way up
to one and that's the same case we were
in before right so in fact you'll notice
the way I wrote this gamma has to be
between zero and one zero inclusive but
strictly less than one if I made it so
that could include one well that's
actually the first case got it because
one to a power is always one and so this
is actually a generalization of the sort
of infinite sum of rewards this is
called discounted rewards or discounted
series or discounted sums and it allows
us it turns out to go an infinite
distance in finite time wait that makes
it no an infinite distance yeah that's
at least the way I like to think about
it so if we're discounted in this
particular way then that gives us a
geometric series and what it does is it
allows us to add an infinite number of
numbers but it actually gives us a
finite number cool so this means we can
still have our and it turns out by the
way just to be clear that this world
that we're in where we are in between
zero and one zero inclusive is still
consistent with our infinite arisings
and our stationarity over preferences so
we can add things together and be
consistent with those assumptions we're
making before or we can do discounted
rewards and we're still going to be
consistent with what we're doing before
but the difference between this case in
this case is that by doing the discount
we get to add infinite sequences and
still get something finite the intuition
here is that since if gamma is less than
1 then eventually as you raise it to a
power it will basically become 0 I mean
that's why it's a geometric series which
is like having a finite horizon but that
horizon is always the same finite
distance away no matter what where you
are in time which means it's effectively
infinite
unbounded or everyone to think about it
so it's like you take a step but you're
no closer than when you started right so
what does that mean in a world where you
meant to say you're no closer to where
you were trying to end up so that means
that even though you've taken a step
forward the horizon sort of remains a
fixed distance away from where you are
that's what it means to have this kind
of this gamma value here and so you can
still treat it as if it's always going
to be infinite even though it gives you
a finite value and that gives you your
stationarity so does that make sense I
mean that's sort of the intuition that
yeah you really are having in you're
always an infinite it's always infinity
but the gamma value means that at any
given point in time you only really have
to think about what amounts to a finite
distance you never get closer to the
horizon even though you're always taking
steps towards it but there still is a
horizon that you can see if I can kill
that analogy so can we can you explain
to me why it has this form this this R
max over one minus gamma I could there's
a you can kind of prove that in a little
cute math way and I'm happy to take that
diversion if you want yeah I think so K
I mean unless unless you were going to
tell me something else well how about I
tell you something else and then I take
that diversion okay okay so here's
something else in the beginning I said
well this is like going an infinite
amount of distance in finite time which
you rebelled against and my explanation
is more about how infinity looks finite
which is not the same thing as going in
infinite distance in finite time the
reason I said that is because of the
singularity if what the singularity so
some of our listeners no doubt have
heard of the singularity you never heard
of the singularity
the singularity is like when computers
get so fast that you can do infinite
computation and oh right so the
singularity for those of you who don't
know is is this sort of observation that
has been made by many folks that the
sort of limit to computer power growing
faster is the fact that it takes is some
amount of time to design the next
generation of computers right so Moore's
law says everything doubles you know
every six 18 months or whatever
but if we could design things faster
then we could actually make it double
more quickly so one day we'll get to the
point where the computer which I will
draw here like that the computer can
actually design the next generation of
computer well when it designs the next
generation of computer that computer
will also have the ability to design the
next generation of computer but it will
be able to design it twice as fast and
then the next one will be able to design
its successor twice as fast and so on
and so forth so this little time between
generations will keep having every
single time which looks remarkably like
a geometric sequence and so once we
reach this point where the computer can
actually design its successor we will
then be able to do an infinite number of
successors in finite time and that's
when the world comes to an end and
that's what's called the singularity
because we can't understand what happens
after that point so that's what I mean
by going an infinite amount of distance
in financer it just doesn't seem like
distance but yeah that's a weird example
I think it makes sense what our infinite
number of doublings in it yeah I don't
know
well well well we'll do a we'll do some
assignment where we allow people to
decide whether this makes sense or one
of your analogies makes sense and I'll
just remind the listener that I'm the
one who'll be assigning final grades
okay so with that let's go and do your
little diversion and and then we'll come
back to doing a whole lot of math so I
actually think this little nice
diversion will be a warm-up to all the
math we're going to be doing okay hmm
more math mmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
