you've gotten some feedback from others
now all you have to do is just keep
plugging away at it until all of the
bugs are squashed and your app doesn't
crash at any point you might even think
at this point you're ready to submit to
the App Store sorry Charlie's it's
actually time for you to do more user
testing see at this point you're just
too close to your app I mean you know
exactly how it's supposed to work and
you also know how to avoid any sticky
situations however subconsciously you
might be doing it I mean simply put you
just can't be trusted to reliably test
your app anymore and now it's time for
you guessed it more user testing in
addition to your classmates it's also a
good idea to distribute your app to your
family and friends or even better a
neutral third party who won't be afraid
to give you critical feedback but how do
you get these apps to users let's take a
look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
