use the decode method it's gonna return
a string with the decoded message and it
doesn't need any arguments so in the
decoder tester we want to print out the
result of decoder decode the decoder was
made with the coded messages string
already in it so we don't need to pass
that string in again now back to the
decoder itself we need to write a for
loop that reads every tenth letter
starting with the 0th one since we're
reading a string we want to go as long
as the index is less than the length of
the string encoded message is the string
that we're reading and instead of
incrementing by one at a time I'm gonna
increment I by ten every time so that we
only see every 10th letter inside the
loop the part that I want to repeat is
reading the ithe letter and adding it to
decoded message so decoded message will
be itself plus encoded message dot
substring from i to i plus 1 remember
this is how we got one letter out of a
longer string let's see if this works
looks like there are more secret
messages in here if you're curious what
they are I guess you'll have to try
starting at different indices let me
talk for a moment about a couple of bugs
that you might have encountered if you
accidentally wrote less than or equals
to right here like this you might
encounter a string out of bounds
exception when you try to access too
high of an index an encoded message a
string index out of bounds exception is
a runtime error that particular runtime
error is nice because it stops the
program and tells you you tried to
access a value that doesn't exist which
is much better than silently messing up
your programs result you could correctly
though a little clumsily write the
condition as I is less than or equal to
encoded message length minus 1 that
would work but I don't think it's as
clean when you iterate over a string
it's best to go as long as I is less
than the length</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
