right when you hear people gender izing
they're robots because you see it from
time to time he was someone say well oh
he's a good robot or she's a good robot
and I never quite understood why you
would do something like that because
really get the end of the day the robots
not a person right the robot has no
feelings the robot has is just
algorithms and sensors that are meant to
work together to provide some sort of an
experience whatever that may be so I
prefer to call a robot and it yes or
that or in a bay I think what would you
know yeah absolutely I tried very hard
to always call them it I actually think
that we should go ahead and develop a
third set of pronouns similar to that
third ontological awareness out of
respect for what they are and also to
help us see them as the artificial
embodied intelligences that a robot is
so I think we should first off this
comes to over featuring a robot anything
that adds trappings of gender should not
be there I really believe that we can
create long gendered asexual robots and
we can utilize a new way of referring to
them and that ultimately would be the
safest thing for us as a society</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
