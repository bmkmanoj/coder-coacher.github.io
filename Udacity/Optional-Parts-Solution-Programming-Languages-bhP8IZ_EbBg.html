together to see why sentence only has
one rewriterule these are sometimes
called production rules as well only one
production rule only one thing to do
with it so we're always going to get
started with optional adjectives
followed by subject followed by verb
this could go to accurate or nothing the
subject could go to William or tell and
the verb could go to shoots or boughs so
we have two choices here two choices in
the middle and two choices at the end
and we multiply that out we get eight
possibilities accurate William shoots
accurate William boughs accurate till
shoots accurate tell boughs William
shoots William boughs tell shoots tell
vows eight possibilities in total
William Tell was a 15th century Swiss
folk hero famously he did not bow he was
requested to bow to the Hat of a city
leader or some such and in exchange was
asked to shoot or offer to shoot the
apple all off of his son's head using a
crossbow this is not a crossbow so at
least two of the sentences above William
boughs tell boughs accurate William
boughs accurate tell bounds for them
didn't happen as far as the story goes
even if you're not familiar with the
story you may have heard the overture
it's actually quite a bit of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
