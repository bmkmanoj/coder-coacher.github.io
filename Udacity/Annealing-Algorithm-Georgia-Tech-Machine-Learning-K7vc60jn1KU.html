for the simulated annealing algorithm
but there's an actual algorithm and it's
it's remarkably simple and remarkably
effective
so the algorithm goes like this we're
just going to repeat for some finite set
of iterations we're going to be at some
point X and we're going to sample a new
point X sub T from the neighborhood of X
and then what are we going to do well
we're going to move our X to that X T
probabilistically so in particular we've
got this probability function px XT T
which is going to help us decide whether
or not to actually make the move and
it's and and the form of that function
is written out here so the probability
that if we're currently at X and we're
thinking about moving to X sub T little
T and the current temperature is capital
T then what's going to happen if the
fitness of the new point is bigger than
or equal to the old point we're just
going to make the move alright so we
always hillclimb when we are at a point
where we can do that so that's just
regular old hillclimber it's kind of
like hill climbing exactly it's a little
different from the hill climbing the way
we described it where we said let's
visit all the points in the neighborhood
this is kind of a useful thing to be
able to do when the neighborhood's
really large is just choose anything in
the neighborhood and if it's an
improvement you know go for it okay but
what if it's not an improvement over
it's not an improvement what we're going
to do is we're going to look at the
Fitness difference between the point
that we're evaluating and the point
where we are now look at the difference
between those two divide that by the
temperature take e to that and interpret
that as a probability and we either make
the move or not with that probability so
all right so let's we got to dive in a
little bit to this expression to make
some sense out of it so what happens
charles if the point that we currently
visited x then we visit a neighbor point
xt what if their fitness is are really
close to each other say you know just
infinitesimally close to each other well
if they're infinitesimally close to one
another then that means that difference
is going to be very close to zero right
and so we get zero over it doesn't
matter what the temperature is we get 0
e to the 0 is 1 so we make the move if
it's you know infinitesimally
than where we were now mm-hmm all right
what if it's a what if it's a big step
down well then that means that number is
really really negative yes and then
negative divided by some positive number
T is a temperature so T is always
greater than equal to zero
yeah let's say that okay
in fact probably making it equal to zero
could run us into trouble so let's just
say that it's bigger than zero so it's
Kelvin so it's in Kelvin okay so we
that'd be a really really big negative
number and E - a really big negative
number is one over e to a really big
number so that makes it very close to
zero good right so in other words if a
giant step down we probably won't take
it okay that make sense so you're sort
of smoothly going in directions that
kind of look bad as a function of how
bad they look and sort of exaggerating
that difference through an exponential
function right okay all right if that if
that gets you going well so three isn't
three times worse than one it's you know
two to the three times worse than one I
say or e to the well so good but let's
let's look at one more thing with this
equation here let's sit let's say that
there's a you know a moderate step down
so it's not so huge that when we divide
it by T it's essentially negative
infinity let's just say it's a smaller
thing you know negative five or
something like that okay then what what
happens now we get some e to the that is
going to be some probability between
zero and one what is the what is T do in
this case what if T is something really
big what is what if T is something
really small well T is something really
big let's say infinity then it doesn't
matter what the difference is it's
effectively going to be zero right so
really big temperature here means that
we're going to have some negative thing
divided by something else this is going
to be essentially zero it's going to be
e to the zero so it's going to be one so
when the temperature is really high
we're actually willing to take downward
steps and we don't even sort of notice
that it's going down lots of randomness
happening right so in fact if T is
infinity it's really really really
really hot then even if the neighbor is
much much worse off
he'll be less worse off than infinity
and so basically you're always just
going to jump to the next person to the
next neighbor to the next point right so
we're very likely to accept so so it's
going to move freely if T is really
small as T approaches zero what happens
well let's just take the extreme case so
T was zero or effectively zero then that
means any difference whatsoever
basically becomes infinity right it gets
magnified by this very very small T and
so then it's not going to take any
downward steps it's only going to go
uphill yeah so that's kind of the
essence of the simulated annealing
algorithm so maybe we can talk about
some of its properties lucre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
