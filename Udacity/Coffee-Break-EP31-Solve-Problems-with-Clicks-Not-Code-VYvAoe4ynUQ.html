right cool hi I'm Andy and welcome to
coffee break I'm an instructor audacity
and a few weeks ago we launched a class
called introduction to Salesforce app
development now if you're a person who
already knows about Salesforce or wants
a job as a developer or an admin that is
great you should take the class but for
this coffee break I want to talk to the
students who don't necessarily know
about Salesforce or who don't want a job
developing for Salesforce I want to talk
to the students who are more interested
in just learning computer science or in
learning more about what computer
science is we have a few classes that
you can take that are great
introductions to computer science one in
Python one in Java but I think if those
classes if you start to take one and it
feels overwhelming for you and that it's
totally possible taking one of these
intro classes it's really easy to get
caught up in all the syntax all the
details of the things you need to type
to make your code work but the truth is
the deep those details aren't what makes
a computer scientist that's not what it
means to think like a computer scientist
what it really means is thinking
abstract ly taking big problems and
dividing them up into smaller pieces
asking big questions and this stuff this
is stuff you can do without any coding
at all and what I really like about this
Salesforce platform in particular is
that it lets you build apps quickly for
one thing but also without having to
think about all these details what lines
of code should I put where you as a
Salesforce developer at least one doing
this point and click side of development
which is what this class covers all you
have to worry about is how do I solve
this problem and abstract level in the
class what we do is we think about a
music festival and we figure out how do
we make an app that will manage a music
festival and that involves all sorts of
great thinking that is generalizable to
any computer programming you may want to
do in the future so if you want to know
what computer scientists do how they
think but you don't want to get caught
up in lots of code writing you should
definitely consider taking this class
helps either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
