advantage is that DNS is used whenever
machine on internet needs to talk to
another machine because DNS stores the
mapping between domain name and IP
address that is DNS is always allowed in
a network and therefore using DNS for
CNC won't stand out easily in this
example here the bad master releases
malware and in the malware the domain
name of the CNC servers hog hold it now
the malware spreads then impression is
how do the bus communicate back to the
bat master in other words how do they
perform CNC with the CNC server to
perform CNC each part is instructed to
communicate to the CNC server as we said
the CSIs server is undefined or a domain
name so the first thing the pub will do
is to add a DNS server hey what's the IP
address for hacker calm and a DNS server
will tell about his IP address and then
the bots would actually communicate to
the CNC server and that's how bad a C&amp;amp;C
works through DNS the kind of DNS
service providers preferred by the by
masses are the dynamic DNS providers
because they allow the frequent changes
of the mapping between domain name and
IP address that is the bad master can
change to use another machine instead of
10.0.0.0 he can change it to 10.0 dot
dot to for example a CNC server for the
same barnett and all he needs to do is
log in to the dynamic DNS provider and
change the mapping so that now hackers
comm points to the new IP address if we
can detect that hackers comm is used for
punish cnc then we can detect that any
machine that connects to it is a bot but
the question is how do we know that
hackers comm is used for parnell cnc it
turns out that the way that parts look
up a domain would suggest that this
domain is most likely used for open a
CNC that is the way that parts look our
domain would be different from a machine
that looks up a web server because of
legitimate user activities such as when
a user is looking up a
News website for example if a domain
such as hackers comm is being locked up
by hundreds of thousands of machines all
over the Internet and yet this domain is
unknown to Google search this is an
anomaly
therefore we can use anomaly detection
at a dynamic DNS provider to examine
curries to DNS domains in order to
identify - C&amp;amp;C domains once we
identified that hackers comm is used for
parnell C&amp;amp;C there are a number of
responses available one option is for
the dynamic DNS provider to set a
mapping of hacker succumb to the IP
address of a sinkhole that is instead of
giving the IP edges of the CNC machine
to the bots the dynamic DNS provider
would give the IP address of the
sinkhole to the bots therefore instead
of connecting to the actual C&amp;amp;C server
order bots will be connecting to a
single machine as a result the bad
master will not be able to command his
pots because when he locks to the CNC
server and look through the logs he will
not be able to find a paths because all
abouts are instead communicating with
the single machine with the sinkhole in
addition to disabling the Bandit
operations security researchers can
learn where the bars are for example by
looking at each connection from the path
to sing hole secured researchers would
know the IP address of each part
therefore it will know where the bots
are throughout Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
