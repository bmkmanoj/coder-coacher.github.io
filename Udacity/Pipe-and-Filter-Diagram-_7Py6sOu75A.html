looks like a pipe and filters the
filters are the components along the way
and the pipes of the little lines
connecting them and and this this form
will indeed solve the problem and yet
it's much different than the previous
form well partners also laid out to
other solutions which I want to briefly
describe to you and they're probably
many more is there a problem necessarily
because the pipe and filter doesn't have
any central storage location that we're
not keeping that data do we need to have
good logging systems for instance if we
use that type of approach because the
data isn't persistent maybe like it
would be with a shared data model well
okay so I haven't really laid out what
the requirements of the problem are okay
and even in the shared data solution
that's in memory it's gonna go away when
the process is over now we could imagine
adding in or being more explicit about
what the requirements are and whether we
need to persist them okay and let's
let's come back to that in a couple
minutes okay okay first I'd like to go
over a couple of other solutions that
Parnas proposes the next one to consider
is called the abstract data type or ADT
solution and this is breaking the system
into components based upon important
data structures so when we had the
shared memory solution that was breaking
things into components based upon
functions and likewise the pipe and
filter was more breaking it into
functions here we're thinking in terms
of the data first we're going to hide
the represented representations of those
days behind abstract interfaces that is
we have a function called
interface to it and how exactly we store
the stuff away is all hidden from the
other components the components holding
the data of course you're also going to
have some operations available to them
in a sense this is a precursor to an
object-oriented approaches not a it was
it was first developed before
object-oriented or but many of the
features that ADT's have have been
incorporated into object-oriented
solutions two things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
