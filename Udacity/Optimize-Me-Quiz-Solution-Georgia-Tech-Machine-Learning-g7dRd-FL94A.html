listen let's work through these Charles
what is what are you thinking for for
this first one I'm thinking I should
write a program and just run it through
because that's the easiest thing to do
so what you're saying is this F function
is so kind of wacky that it's hard to
imagine actually analyzing it and doing
anything with it but on the other hand
the X the space of X values is very
small right good so right so we can
enumerate all the different possible
values and just see which one gives the
highest output
yeah that's pretty straightforward if I
just wrote the code in fact it's like
one line of code so I wrote it for you
oh good nice that way you are this away
you optimized our time I did so for what
it's worth this is what the function
looks like I'm sure that's a function is
that beautiful it's something it looks
like DNA gone wrong yeah totally wrong
like just just mutations everywhere it's
like a bowtie that then tried to tie
itself in another dimension I mean like
you can see there's this sort of
interesting up and down miss to it like
a sub like the sine wave part but it
like their inner their inter digitated
with each other it's all it's just crazy
interdigitated yeah it means it means to
put your fingers together so so what
happens if you plot that but with
connecting lines oh sure like that Wow
this is a kind of unfriendly function
yes it's not the friendliest function
I've ever seen well now it looks a bit
like a actually looks a bit like an
insane bowtie nice electric bowtie yeah
so it turns out that there's two points
that are really really close to being
the top there's this one at 11 and
there's this one I don't know a little
bit after 80 or so but the one at 11 is
actually the largest this function goes
to 11 it does indeed
so I'm gonna say 11 I wanted to make a
crazy function that was the is the first
thing that popped into my head actually
I did the second one was a mod 3 at
first
hmm well it's an interesting thing right
because if you try to reason this out it
would be very difficult to do
I mean first off mod isn't very nicely
you know it's very easy it's not very
easy to deal with algebraically right in
close form but you can start reasoning
and say
the dominating factor is mod seven in
the sense that you're never gonna be
greater than six and of course the mod
six never gonna be greater than five so
the best you can get there is five and
then you minus the sine which is going
to be some small number so you can kind
of pick all the values that are gonna
give you something like five there and
then whichever one has the smallest sign
that's the one you go for I wonder if
that would get you anywhere close to the
right answer
so interesting that that's not quite
true here because 11 mod six is no let
mod 6 is 5 right squared is 25 mod 7 is
4 there right anyway hmm let's do the
second one okay all right so it turns
out that again 11 and 80 are really
close but 11 is slightly larger and it's
just almost 5 but not quite all right so
for the second problem now we can't use
the same trick of enumerate in because
our X's constitute the entire space of
the reals so there's like 200 of them
more even hmm so we need to do something
else and I think what you were pointing
out to me is that because this is a nice
polynomial we can actually use calculus
to figure out where the maximum is right
just take the derivative and set it
equal to zero so unfortunately I made
that a little harder than then probably
you'd appreciate so the derivative would
be this and setting it equal to zero
would give us this equation which
unfortunately is a cubic right so it
should have three solutions perhaps and
you could just check each of them but
solving the cubic is sort of a pain hmm
I guess I could have been a little bit
nicer you could have been sorry about
that it all depends on what you're
optimizing so how would you go about
solving this now I would go on Google
and I would look up how do you solve
cubics sure that's not a bad idea any
other things because it is nice and
smooth right so let's here let's let me
actually plot it for you so here's the
function and I just plotted a sub range
of it from minus 500 to a thousand you
know you could ask well could it be that
the maximum is actually someplace
outside this range
do you know how you'd answer that No so
because it's a fourth order polynomial
like think about like a quadratic it's
gotten that one bump in it a cubic can
have as much as you know one up bump and
one down bump and a quartic a fourth
degree polynomial can have an up bump
but down bump and up and then back down
so we're actually seeing all the
activity here outside this range it just
plummets negatively if they can't turn
around and come back up again so because
we can see the two bumps we're good okay
and in this case it looks like the the
bump that we want is somewhere between
500 and a thousand somewhere in the 700
kind of zone and well so one thing we
could do because it's really well
behaved we can kind of zoom in on the
function in that range mm-hmm so there
we are now assumed in from between 500 a
thousand we can see okay well actually
it looks like the peak is maybe between
600 and 800 you think that's a 700
between 700 800 all right let's take a
look at that ooh nice and pointy all
right so how about them about 740 and
760 so we really are kind of getting
into the nitty-gritty here so so for the
quiz well you know we accepted anything
between you know 7:45 and 755 but in
fact we can keep zooming in and we can
use calculus and we can we can really
hone in on what that the tippy-top is
there but that's not so important right
now we could also use something called
Newton's method
do you know Newton's method I remember
it Newton Newton's method says if you
know its guess a position like you know
455 or sorry 755 and use the derivative
at that point which is actually really
easy to compute it doesn't involve
solving that the cubic it just involves
writing down the cubic and evaluating at
that point we can actually you know fit
what the straight line is here and we
can take it take steps in the direction
of that line it's a it's a gradient
ascent kind of method yeah and and
that'll allow us to hone in as we get
closer and closer to the top the slope
is going to flatten out we're going to
take smaller steps and this process
converges to whatever the the peak is I
think it's a little bit under 750 it
looks about right
