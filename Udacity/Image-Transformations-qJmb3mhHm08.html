image transformations in general so far
we have looked at image filtering now
what are we going to talk about is image
warping or image transformation so here
basically assume we have an image F and
what we're interested in doing is some
sort of a transformation so for example
what we have looked at is we've
transformed this image to a new one and
here hopefully you can see that this
image is not much brighter if you
remember what we've looked at before one
of the best ways of doing this would be
to look loop over the entire image and
look at each and every intensity and
perhaps do some calculations to it in
this one I just added let's say 20 more
intensity points to it now force this
image is brighter here now let's do
another form of transformation to get
the output image G here if you notice
what we've done is we've actually now
stretched out the image so if you look
at this a number of columns here there
are more number of columns here of
course so far the same number of rows so
in essence we've changed the width of
the image keeping the height the same so
in the case of doing filtering what
we're basically doing is we're changing
the range of the image the inside values
of the function itself so basically to
get the output image what we basically
have done is that put in a function and
transform the function itself to get the
new image in case of changing the size
of the image and such what we're
basically changing is the number of
things like rows and columns the inside
not the content but the indices of the
matrix that we're changing to do this of
course we basically are now growing a
transformation of the insights that is
the width and the height and all of the
information associated with it and
that's changing the function so the
transformation of course in this one is
is the change of domain of the image as
opposed to change of range of the image
those of you curious about these terms I
encourage you to look back to your old
calculus or algebra material on defining
what is the range and domain of a
function and of course here our function
is always an image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
