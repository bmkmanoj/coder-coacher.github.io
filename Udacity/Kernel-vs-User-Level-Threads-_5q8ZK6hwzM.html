illustration we used in the threads and
concurrency lecture there we explained
that threads can be supported at user
level at kernel level or both supporting
threads at the kernel level means that
the OS kernel itself is multi-threaded
to do this the OS kernel maintains some
abstraction for threads or data
structure to represent threads and it
performs all of the operations like
synchronization scheduling etc in order
to allow these threads to share the
physical resources supporting threads at
the user level means that there is a
user level library that is linked with
the application and this library
provides all of the management and the
runtime support for threads it will
support a data structure that's needed
to implement the thread abstraction and
provide all the scheduling
synchronization and other mechanisms
that are needed to make resource
management decisions for these threads
in fact different processes may use
entirely different user level libraries
that have different ways to represent
threads that support different
scheduling mechanisms etc we also
discuss several mechanisms how user
level threads can be mapped onto the
underlying kernel level threads and we
said these include a one to one
many to one and a many to many mapping
and briefly touched upon some of the
pros and cons of each approach now we'll
take a more detailed look about what
exactly is needed to describe kernel
versus user level threads and to support
all of these types of models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
