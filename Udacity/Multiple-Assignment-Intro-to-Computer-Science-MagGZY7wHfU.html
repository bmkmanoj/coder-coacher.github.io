break you know about while oops
you know about if to make decisions you
know everything you need to finish the
goal of today's unit which is to write
the code for extracting all of the URLs
from a webpage so first let's remember
what we were doing before we had the
code that kept repeating to get one link
after another so we had code like this
we had finding the start link and we
assumed before entering this code that
page has the contents of some web page
and we would search for the start of a
link then we would find the start quote
again using fine but this time passing
in the start of the tag and searching
for the double quote and then we would
find the end quote and then we would
extract the URL using the string
selection selecting from page from the
start quote to the end quote then we
would print out the URL and this was
what we need to do to form one URL and
then we will continue by advancing the
page to go from where we found the end
quote to the end and then we would do
all the same thing again to find the
next URL and we keep doing this code
over and over again finding as many URLs
as there were on the page so here's the
code shrunken down just so we have some
more space and what we want to do is
extract into a procedure this part and
then we want to make it so we can keep
going and we've seen why loops
give us a way to keep going so we'll end
up writing a while loop that keeps
looking for links till we reach the end
of the page so the first thing we're
going to talk about is how we extracted
this procedure and we're going to need
to make a few changes to it to make it
work well in our while loop we defined a
procedure get next target that takes the
page as an input and essentially had
exactly the code we had fear except for
at the end it would return both the URL
and the value of end quote
and we had a quiz earlier where you
determine that what get next target
should do is return both the URL and the
end quote that is the position where the
end of the quote was found so we needed
this procedure to return two values
because we need to know both the URL as
a string and where to continue looking
for the next target we haven't yet used
a procedure that returns two things but
it's actually quite convenient and
simple to do this we can do this by just
having two values on the left side of an
assignment statement this works in
general so we can do instead of our
simple assignment rule where we had a
name followed by an equal followed by an
expression and that would assign the
value of the expression to name we can
have multiple names on the left side and
multiple expressions on the right side
so we can do multiple assignment where
we have any number of names separated by
commas and equal sign and then any
number of expressions also separated by
commas as long as the number of names
and the number of expressions match what
happens is the value of the first
expression is assigned to the first name
so this name will now refer to whatever
this value was the value of the second
expression is assigned to the second
name so as an example if we had a comma
B equal 1 comma 2 this would assign to a
the value 1 + 2 B the value 2 so in
order to get the two values returned by
this procedure what we need is to have
two variables on the left side and the
procedure call on the right so the
syntax we'll use is just the URL we'll
use that as the variable till the URL
and end pause we'll use that as the
variable to hold the end position and
then on the right side we have get next
target passing in page and since this
returns two values it's like listing two
expressions the first value returned
will be assigned to URL the second value
returned will be assigned to end
being able to have multiple variables on
the left side of an assignment is very
useful let's have a quiz to see an
example of why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
