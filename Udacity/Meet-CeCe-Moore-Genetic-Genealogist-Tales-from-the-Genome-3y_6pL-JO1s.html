in conjunction with traditional
genealogy research in order to learn
more about our roots that's really
amazing um you know we have an
individual and our course named sterling
who is actually submitted his DNA sample
to 23 Emmy and gotten results back and
he has been able to find a as close a
match as a second cousin on the relative
finder now if you were chatting with him
and he was looking for a next step what
advice would you give to him to sort of
deal with trying to reach out to that
person or possibly you know finding
other connections that he could get more
information from there's a couple
different things he should do first of
all he may want to join one of our
adoption DNA mailing list we have
extremely helpful search angels on those
lists who started out as traditional
adoption search angels so they know how
to work with the records and if he has
any non-identifying information that can
really help to use that in conjunction
with his DNA results so we can help to
teach him on those lists what he needs
to do next and sometimes you know do
more than just teach him but handhold
and if he gets real close to the answer
one of the search angels will jump in
and help and when I say real close a
second cousin is really close so he
probably could find someone who'd be
willing to help him work through these
matches and try to identify his birth
parents you actually run a very popular
blog called your genetic genealogist and
I'd love for you to tell us a little bit
more about how you started that blog and
what it means to you and and what people
use it for today I guess that means I
have to start at the beginning a little
bit which is that I was a genealogist
just hobbyist and I've always loved
genetics it's not my career in the past
I wasn't trained in it but I've always
been drawn to it and always really loved
it and so when autosomal DNA was
introduced for genealogical purposes by
23andme I jumped in with both feet I was
so excited it was actually katherine
gorges who is the director of I SOG who
first showed me what they were doing
and I just fell madly in love and it
completely took over my life so it went
from being a hobby to a full-time
volunteer position and now a career and
part of that was starting my blog I was
answering a lot of questions all the
time of people who needed help right
away and so I wanted a way to be able to
answer those questions and not have to
keep repeating the same answers over and
over I was also doing some really
fascinating research with my own family
and wanted to have a place to write that
up and I was corresponding with 23andme
a lot people who worked over there right
away I established a good relationship
with them and it was actually one of
them who recommended that I start a blog
it was Alex from 23 he's not there
anymore but he was one of the early
employees there and he said you know you
should write a blog and so I'd never
done anything like that and I enjoyed it
right off the bat it was so fun to share
my research and get input from everybody
and help people learn what to do with
their results as well well um you know
we're really intrigued that you say you
know genetics is a passion of yours but
it wasn't actually what you studied can
you tell us a bit more about what you
did before you got into this and sort of
what your segway was were you just a
super super nerd spend all your free
time in genetics or was this just a
really fun hobby for you genetics was
always something that I was interested
in but I have not studied it in fact I
was a music and theatre major in college
and I had fallen in love with genetics
just prior to that in my senior year in
high school when I was in AP bio we had
a little genetics section as part of our
coursework and I absolutely loved it so
I should have taken the clue then and I
I loved it enough that I did think about
changing my major and I even
investigated it but I already had a
scholarship for music at USC and they
didn't have a genetics undergraduate
program all right very well may have
done it but I just stuck with my
original plan and many years later Here
I end up back again in loving genetics
but this time it took over my life so I
had started
a genealogist in 2002 I think was when I
really got involved and i was looking at
making a family tree for my niece's
wedding and I the type of person who
jumps in with both feet and I did that
and got kind of obsessed and did
genealogy for a few years before I got
really interested in the genetics part
of it we were just using why DNA and
mtdna at the time which I still thought
was interesting but I wasn't quite as
fascinated as i am with autosomal DNA
and that's really become my focus
although I use the other types in
conjunction with it many times
especially in adoption searches so how
did I get into it so I started writing
the blog and I got so many questions
from people and so much interest that it
literally started taking over my life I
had tons of comments on the blog I had
tons of private emails of people wanting
help particularly people who were
searching for close family members like
adoptees and people who had discovered
close family members and hadn't expected
it there's so many people out there that
this is happening too you'd be surprised
and I sometimes wonder if there's much
more of that in our society than we
realize but then I think it's also
possible that the people who are drawn
to testing are the people who may be
felt a little different or felt like
something was missing in their lives so
to go from entertainment and then end up
in a science career in my 40s is
definitely not something I would have
ever imagined but it is so fascinating
every day I wake up in the morning and I
immediately want to jump out of bed and
run down to my computer and see what new
fascinating things had transpired
overnight and believe me there is always
something there's such a huge demand for
this and maybe a year ago some people
had come to me and asked me you know if
they wanted to have a career in genetic
genealogy was there was there a demand
for it and it's changed really then
maybe a year ago two years ago there
wasn't much of a demand for it and in
the last year or two it has literally
loaded so now I absolutely would say
that there is room for genetic genealogy
consultants people who are willing to
learn what we're doing and if they have
a background in genealogy that would be
great and if they don't that's fine too
they'll have to learn both sides of it
so they'll have to learn the DNA part
and the genealogy part but if their
adventurous and they're looking for a
new career and they love detective work
because that's exactly what this is then
I would strongly recommend that they
look into this as a career in in the
same vein is there any other specific
advice or resources you would give to
someone who's particularly moved by this
subject and wants to investigate about
the possibility of studying more there's
some places they can go to sort of learn
more about how to become a genetic
genealogist that you recommend yes
because the field is so fast moving
there are very few books that really
address the subject and every day we
have someone asking you know is there a
genetic genealogy for dummies book and
there isn't not yet at least and that's
because those of us who've tried to
write them find that they are so quickly
outdated that trying to get something
published is very difficult that's up to
date so we always recommend that you
read the blogs you read my blog Blaine's
blog Roberta sd's blog there's some
other really good ones out there Kitty
Cooper has recently started writing some
fantastic resources and most of all join
our mailing lists because that's where
you really get help from the experts and
the people who've been doing this from
the very beginning are very generous
with their time and their on those lists
so join the International Society of
genetic genealogy it's free it's I SOG
is OGG org and then you'll get an
invitation to join the DNA newbie list
which I happen to administer and you can
go there and ask the most basic
questions and we have people who've been
on the list for quite a while so we also
have more intermediate discussions and
sometimes even venture into more
advanced so just keep reading everything
you can that's how I learned this great
CC has been a pleasure chatting with you
I hope you'll join us again maybe in the
discussion forums for our core
that would be great I'd love to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
