by exploring inverse functions inverse
functions are a way that we can undo
what we do to an input for example if we
double the number the inverse of that
would be dividing it by two before we
get into the fancy notation let's just
look at a mapping between two sets here
are three ordered pairs the first set is
a B and C and the second set is two
three and one a maps to to be maps the
three and see maps to one we could also
show this using a mapping diagram here's
the first set containing a B and C and
here's the second set containing the
numbers one two and three we said a maps
to to be maps to three and see maps to
one now this would be considered a
function since every input has one
distinct and unique output in other
words every single output has one unique
input that creates it now let's consider
a different function this time this
function will have the ordered pairs to
a3 be and 1c this function is the
inverse function of this one and we
could express it with this mapping
notice that here we have the inputs of
one two and three here here and here now
these inputs correspond to different
outputs one corresponds to c 2
corresponds to a and 3 corresponds to be
look carefully at these two functions
and their mappings to figure out their
relationship what do you think is the
relationship between a function and it's
inverse once you've taken some time to
think about this I want you to try and
answer this next question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
