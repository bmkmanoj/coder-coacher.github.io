that has these properties and what we
want the hash function to do is to take
a string as its input
we'll call the hash function hash
underscore string and it will produce as
output a number between 0 and B so we
also need another input to our hash
string which is going to be the size of
the hash table so that'll be the second
input is the size of the hash table the
number of buckets what we haven't seen
yet that we're going to need for this
function is a way to turn a string into
a number Python provides an operation to
do that it's called Ord for ordinal and
what Ord takes as its input is a one
letter string and produces as its output
a number and the actual mapping between
strings and numbers is not so important
we just want something that's going to
map different strings to different
numbers there's another operator that
goes in the opposite direction that
takes in a number and outputs the one
letter string that corresponds to that
number and the property these functions
have is their inverses that if we take
the character corresponding to the
ordinal corresponding to any one letter
string we'll call that alpha what we get
as a result is the same alpha that we
passed in so let's try a few examples in
the Python interpreter to see how Ord
and CH are work so we'll print Ord of a
and when we run that we see we get the
number 97 if we try print ORD of capital
a that's different we get 65 and if we
print or of B we get 66 so the numbers
are sort of sensible B is higher than a
the lowercase letters have different
ordinals than the uppercase so if we try
lowercase B we should expect to get 98
and that is indeed what we get and these
are the numbers based on the ASCII and
character encoding what the actual
numbers are are not very important for
us other than that we get different
numbers for different letters so we'll
be able to use there
salsa or to make different strings has
two different values and just to show
that they are inverses if we do or to
view and then charge that what we get
back is the single letter string u that
we started with the limit award is it
only works on one letter strings if it
provided a mapping from any string to a
number that would be useful for a hash
table well then we'd be done but it
doesn't do that if we try running it on
a multi letter string we get an error it
says that Ord expects a single character
but it got a string of length seven so
we're going to need to use Ord only on
single letter strings so with Ord we
have a way of converting strings to
numbers converting single character
strings to numbers the other property we
need our hash function to have is the
output number is always between 0 and B
minus 1 we need it to be in that range
because we're going to use that to index
the list to find the bucket where that
string belongs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
