tricky and even somewhat debatable but
our answer here is that the
transcription factor would bind less
tightly now it probably wouldn't bind
more tightly in this scenario because we
set it up as the protein binds this
sequence really well and then we change
that sequence so we wouldn't expect the
protein to be able to at the very least
bind as well it is possible in some
scenarios that we lose the ability to
bind altogether but in general any given
sequence of DNA one protein is making
contact at multiple points at multiple
letters so any given sequence there are
multiple important points of contact and
changing just one of them won't
completely obliterate the ability of the
protein to bind but you will diminish
its ability to bind tightly so if we
deleted this whole sequence all together
at that point we're looking at something
where the transcription factor wouldn't
bind it all now as is true for virtually
everything in biology there are
exceptions to every rule and there may
be a scenario out there where you delete
one letter and the whole protein can't
bind any more and we'll even talk about
different scenarios at some point where
one change in the letter might actually
result in a higher affinity binding the
protein binding more tightly but for
right now our basic purposes we just
wanted to emphasize the point that
proteins bind specific DNA sequences and
when we change those sequences or when
they're different or not optimal that
the protein usually binds less tightly
there's less of an affinity because
we're talking about chemistry here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
