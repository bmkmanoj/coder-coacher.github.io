actor wants to maximize the number of
burned calories and he burns 12 calories
for every minute of step aerobics and
four for every minute of stretching he
can't spend more than 40 minutes total
so I expressed that constraint by saying
that X plus y is at most 40 and
expressing that he has to spend five
minutes stretching is a little
unintuitive because the way the
inequality is directed here but I can do
it by saying that negative Y is at most
negative five like so using the graph
and check method of your high school
teacher gives the optimum solution as 35
minutes of step aerobics and five
minutes of stretching now you probably
didn't bother graphing the polytope as
I've done here the answer was too
obvious but why was it so obvious maybe
you realized that more exercise was
better and started thinking about
constraints somewhere along here that
used up all 40 minutes because step
aerobics burn more calories you realize
that you would want to do as many of
them as possible pulling you along this
constraint downward towards this vertex
or maybe you realize that just five
minutes of stretching and zero minutes
of step aerobics would satisfy the
constraints and then you decided to
increase the number of minutes spent on
step aerobics until you ran into another
constraint in either case your intuition
led you to think very much along the
lines of the simplex method that we'll
see in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
