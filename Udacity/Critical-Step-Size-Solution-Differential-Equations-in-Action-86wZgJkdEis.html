to be smaller than half of delta x
squared divided by a thermal diffusivity
let me explain why if the time step was
exactly equal to one-half times the
square of delta x divided by thermal
diffusivity this expression would equal
to and our result would be minus one
what would happen is that our initial
temperature distribution would be
reflected after the first time step
where it was one before it would be
minus one after and it's easy to compute
that where it was minus one before it
would be one after the next time step
would undo this reflection and healed
the blue distribution again and so on
and so on you would see infinite
oscillation people see oscillation but
no decay if H is smaller than one-half
this ratio this expression is smaller
than two if H is smaller than one-half
times this ratio this expression is
smaller than two we're subtracting less
so the result is larger than minus 1 our
new temperature after one time step at
position zero is not minus one but a
little more than that and of course it's
similar for the others so you see that
we're not totally reflecting our
function you're losing a little and with
the next time step we again are going to
lose a little so that's going to work
out well as soon as H is smaller than
one-half this ratio we are going to see
decay but to stop that oscillation
during the decay we indeed have to pick
H smaller than one quarter of that ratio
so that we are subtracting less than one
this condition shows that our method is
really poor if you use a spatial
subdivision that's finer by a factor of
two we have to use a time step that's
smaller by a factor of four hopefully
this reminds you of unit three where we
covered implicit methods to deal with
such instabilities for partial
differential equations implicit methods
may be unavoidable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
