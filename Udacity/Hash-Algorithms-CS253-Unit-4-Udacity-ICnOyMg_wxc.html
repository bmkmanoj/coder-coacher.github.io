and of course you can write your own but
you should never write your own the
first lesson you'll learn in in CS 387
is don't write your own at least for our
purposes of course if you're building a
hash table you know you can you can do
whatever you want but if you're going to
use it for security purposes don't write
your own then you know if you want to
learn how to make a hash table knock
yourself out
of course somebody's probably already
done it better but hey you never know so
anyway some popular algorithms are crc32
which is basically designed for for
checksums if you were to send somebody a
bunch of data you know like a big file
you know you might also include a CRC of
that file and that you know is basically
just a simple way to verify that you've
got the entire file and it's not
corrupted because you know you can send
a see it you can send a hash easier than
you can send a whole file you know you
can copy and paste the hash it's just a
few bits you can verify that the file
they you received has the same CRC as
the file they sent and then you don't
have to you know verify bit for bit that
you have the correct file so CRC is
really fast it's really it's really only
purpose is for doing checksums basically
creating a hash of a large file it's
security properties are not very good
it's very easy to find what we call a
collision which is when you know when
two things hash to the same value which
is you know the whole point of a hash is
that we can get a different value for
almost anything that we're going to hash
now obviously if if the size of the
input is substantially greater than the
size of the output yes there are going
to be collisions the whole point is that
it's hard to find them and with crc32
it's very easy to find them the reason
you would use CRC is because you don't
care about collisions you just care
about speed and CRC is very fast the
most popular hashing algorithm out there
is still md5 which used to be used
because it was both fast you know ish
not as fast as crc32 but pretty fast and
people you know thought it was pretty
secure except it's not
md5 has been broken repeatedly over the
last few years and it's very easy to
find md5 collisions you know given a
an X that hashes into a y it's very easy
given this y to find another X that
hashes into it which is as you'll see a
big problem so we won't be using md5 for
much at all in this class well it has
its use cases right if you have a
limited input it's hard to find a
collision there's certain a class of
attacks you know by making X longer
longer and longer and longer that's a
really easy way to find a collision in
md5 but if you limit the length of X
then you don't have to worry too much
about that vulnerability so anyway just
keep that in mind
when you really care about the data
don't use md5 the second most popular
hash it's called sha-1 this is not as
fast but it's fairly secure just now are
we starting to kind of hear you know
demonstrations of people finding uh
collisions in sha-1 it's still pretty
good it's it's actually the second most
widely used hash behind md5 but for
things going forward you should really
use something like for example sha-256
which is as you might guess just kind of
a bigger version of sha-1 it's actually
not the algorithm I believe has changed
as well so we'll say this one is secure
ish and this one is pretty good it's
going to take off it's going to take
some time now of course the trade-off is
speed you know so the better your
hashing algorithm right now the slower
it is so these are kind of these are
basically organized in cost and in
security so no big surprise there that
there's a kind of an inverse correlation
between cost and security but that's the
name of the game so depending on what
problem you're working on you may need
to may need to actually make a decision
but for our purposes we're not going to
get a whole lot of traffic we'll
probably you sha-256 for most things so
let me show you how you would use these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
