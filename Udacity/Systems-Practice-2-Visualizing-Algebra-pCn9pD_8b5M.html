pounds of raisins with pounds of nuts to
get a trail mix he's wondering how much
of each he should use to make the trail
mix so we know we're going to need two
variables are will stand for the pounds
of raisins he'll use and n will stand
for the pounds of nuts will use the
trail mix will contain both the raisins
and the nuts so if we add up the pounds
of the raisins and the pounds of the
nuts we'll get our total pounds of trail
mix I can use these variables to write
my first equation the pounds of raisins
are plus the pounds of nuts n should
equal 15 our total amount of trail mix
for the second equation we know that the
cost of raisins plus the cost of the
nuts should be the total cost of the
trail mix our raisins are charged at
three dollars and fifty cents per pound
so if i take three dollar fifty cents
per pound times the number of pounds of
raisins I'll get my cost of the reasons
the same is true for the nuts we have n
pounds of nuts times two dollars per
pound so this is my cost the trail mix
is going to cost two dollars and
sixty-six per pound but we need to
figure out how much pounds in total we
have of trail mix if we used our pounds
of raisins and in pounds of nuts then
our total pounds of trail mix would be R
plus n this last part is probably one of
the hardest steps in this problem but if
you remember that you are making the
trail mix from pounds of raisins and
pounds of nuts it should make sense I'm
going to solve the system using
substitution since I can easily solve
for one of these variables if i subtract
our from both sides I'll get n is equal
to 15 minus R now I can perform
substitution I'll take 15 minus R and
plug it in for in and my second equation
I could also take 15 minus R and plug it
in for n right here in the equation but
I already know the value of r plus n I
know r plus n is equal to 15 so i can
replace this entire parentheses with 15
replacing this parentheses with 15 will
be much simpler than replacing this end
with 15 minus R because here we'll get a
number instead of a bunch of variables
next I group my like terms together then
i subtract 30 from both sides to get 1.5
r is equal to 9 finally we divide by the
coefficient of our to get r is equal to
6 our for the number of pounds of
air
we used so really this is six pounds the
pounds of raisins and the pounds of nuts
should add up to 15 so using some mental
math or solving an equation we can get n
is equal to 9 pounds the pounds of nuts
as always let's go back and make sure
these answers make sense our pounds of
raisins was 6 and our pounds of nuts was
9 so the grocer had six pounds and nine
pounds which did indeed total 15 pounds
next we can replace six for our and 94 n
to determine the cost and make sure that
our second equation is true so replace
each of the variables and then I
multiply each of these numbers together
making sure to add six and nine before
multiplying by two dollars and sixty
cents so we have 21 dollars plus
eighteen dollars equals thirty nine
dollars so yes this equation is true as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
