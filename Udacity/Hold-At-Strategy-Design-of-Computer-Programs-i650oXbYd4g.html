strategies that I'm calling hold at n
where n is an integer for example hold
at 20 is a strategy that keeps on
rolling until the pending score is
greater than or equal to 20 and then it
holds and the point of this strategy is
you get points by rolling but you risk
points by rolling as well and the higher
the pending score is the more you're
risking so there should be some point at
which you're saying that's too much of a
risk I've accumulated so much pending
that I don't want to risk any more and
then I'm going to hold so hold that 10
hold at 20 hold that 30 describes that
family of strategies and i should say
there's one settle t here that will
build in to hold that which is let's say
that the goal is 50 and and my score
when i start my round is say 40 and then
let's say i roll a six and A four now
according to hold at 20 I should keep on
rolling because my pending score is only
10 I haven't gotten up to 20 yet but it
would be silly for me to keep rolling at
that point because I would risk picking
out and only scoring one point in
getting to 41 whereas I know if I hold
now I have 40 plus six plus four is 50
I've already won the game so hold that
20 will hold when pending is greater
than or equal to 20 or when you win by
holding so I want you to go ahead and
implement that and since hold that X as
a whole family of strategy functions
whole that X is not going to be a
strategy function rather it's going to
return a strategy function and so I've
given you this outline of saying we're
going to define a strategy function then
we're going to fix up its name a little
bit to describe it better and then we're
going to return it and you have to write
the code within the strategy function
and i should say we're going to stick
with the representations of states where
a state is a four tuple of the player to
move 01 me and you score and the pending
score</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
