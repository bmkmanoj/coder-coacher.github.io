of steps the step complexity and that
should be the same as reduction since
all we're running is a whole bunch of
parallel reductions the reductions all
have different sizes so to get the
overall step complexity we need to look
at the largest reduction which is a
reduction at the end here of all n
elements so the number of steps to
reduce in elements and thus the number
of steps to perform this entire
computation is order of log n to compute
the total amount of work we notice that
we're going to have in reductions to
perform the first reduction requires
zero additions the second reduction
requires a single addition the third
reduction requires two additions and in
general the nth output will require n
minus 1 additions and so what we're
gonna have to do is sum up that whole
series 0 plus 1 plus 2 on to n minus 1
and if we do add up that series we're
gonna find that the result is roughly N
squared over 2 additions so the overall
amount of work is proportional to the
square of the number of elements we
would say that the number of additions
overall is order of N squared so while
we like having a smaller number of steps
than the serial version remember that
took go of n steps this quadratic work
complexity makes this formulation of
scan ridiculously inefficient so what
we're going to do next is look at two
other algorithms that have a more
reasonable cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
