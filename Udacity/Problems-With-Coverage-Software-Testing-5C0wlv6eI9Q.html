measure and coverage was useful in
finding a bug in a piece of code and
what I want to show you now is another
piece of code this will be a really
quick example where coverage is not
particularly useful in spotting the bug
and so what I have here on the screen is
a broken function whose job is to
determine whether a number is prime that
is to say it doesn't correctly do its
job of determining whether the number is
prime so let's look at the logic in this
function so his prime takes a number if
the number is less than or equal to 1 or
divisible by 2 then it's not prime now
once the number passes that test what
we're going to do is loop over every
number between 3 and the square root of
the number and check if the original
input number divides evenly by that
number if it does then of course we
don't have a prime number and if all of
those tests fail to find a divisor then
we have a prime number and so what you
can see is there's a little bit of test
code here that checks how this function
responds for the numbers 1 through 5 and
20 through 24 and so what let's do is
let's just run this code this code has
correctly computed that 1 is not prime 2
is not prime 3 is prime 4 is not but 5
is similarly 20 21 and 22 are not prime
numbers they all have divisors 23 is
prime in 24 is not so for these 10
examples the is prime function has
successfully identified whether the
input is prime or not so now let's run
the code coverage tool ok so we got the
same output now let's look at the
results so we can see out of the 20
statements in the file all of them ran
and none of them failed to be covered
statement coverage gives us a perfect
result for this particular code and yet
as I said it's wrong here we have the
same code in the IDE so let's run it the
output is what we expect and what I'd
like you to do is do two things first of
all add at least one test case where you
check a value for prime nasira turns the
wrong result and then second create a
new function is Prime 2 that fixes the
error that is to say it correctly
identifies for any natural number input
that is to say any input 1 or larger
whether it's primary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
