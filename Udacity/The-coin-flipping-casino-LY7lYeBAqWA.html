thought experiment called the coin
flipping casino so instead of buying and
selling stocks we're gonna flip coins
and we're gonna bet on the outcome of
whether those coins come up heads or
tails
so that's analogous to a single
investment and a stock or a single trade
in the stock where you buy it and hold
it and either you make money or you lose
money well we're gonna flip a coin and
either make money or lose money now the
coin is biased in other words we have
information about this coin and we know
that it's more likely to come up heads
than tails and in fact that probability
is about 0.5 1 that'll come up heads so
that's our edge that's like our alpha
when investing in stocks and the
uncertainty of the outcome is like beta
in stock investing here's how betting
works so you can bet on any particular
coin flip you can bet end coins if you
win in other words it comes up heads you
now have two end points if you lose they
take your money so this is called an
even money bet so on each outcome you
either make in coins or you lose in
coins here's how the casino works there
are a thousand betting tables each with
their own biased coin and you have a
thousand tokens so you can choose to bet
however you like in other words you can
put ten tokens on each of a hundred
tables you could put a thousand tokens
on one table you could put one token on
all the tables once you've distributed
all your tokens which represent your
bets the coins are all flipped at once
in other words the game runs in parallel
and you for each bet that you made you
either get your winnings or they take
the chips that you bet so now that we've
set up this environment for us to
experiment with I want you to think a
little bit about it and think about how
would you allocate these tokens is it
better
to bet all your tokens on just one coin
flip or is it better to bet on multiple
coin flips at once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
