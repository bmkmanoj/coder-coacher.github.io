in their main types let's discuss where
requirements come from and there are
many possible sources for requirements
so I'm gonna list here the main ones the
first one I clearly stakeholders anybody
or is affected by the system and its
functionality customers users and so on
a second typical source of requirements
is the application domain for example
the fact that my software is running
within a bank or within a school why is
the application domain a source or
requirement well because there are
constraints there are characteristics of
the application domain that will affect
the functionality of the system for a
simple example just think about
regulations so banking regulations and
school regulations in these cases those
are things they may affect the
functionality of my system and therefore
they might become part of my
requirements and finally documentation
can be an additional source of
requirements for example notes papers
manuals books
so everything that refers to the
functionality of the system they were
going to build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
