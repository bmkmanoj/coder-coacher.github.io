intricate process this is something
that's usually handled by special
functions within natural language
processing toolkits like n LT K or other
types of toolkits that are available in
other languages let me give you a quick
idea of what this looks like
so I fire up my Python interpreter and
the first thing that I do is I import a
stemmer as it happens there are several
different stammers that are available
I'm going to show you what the snowball
stemmer does but there are several
others that you might see from time to
time so this happens to be the command
for importing the snowball stemmer so
I'll go ahead and do that I just found
this on example on the internet and that
usually takes a second or two and then
what I'm gonna do is actually create the
stemmer and just like with the stop
words I have to declare a language that
I want to stem in because of course
stemming a French word will be different
from stemming an English word we will do
English okay so now I have this stemmer
and I can use it to stem anywhere that I
like so let's try one of the words from
my responsive example so I call the stem
function on the stammer that I've just
created and let's use the word
responsiveness and it gives us that the
stem of that is going to be responds so
something very similar to what we were
guessing in the last video let's try
another one that's similar
same as before responds and now I've
added a prefix to it unresponsive so it
means the opposite of responsive but
we're still talking about the concept of
whether something is responsive or not
so we should get the same stem still we
can also see that there are certain
limitations to this particular summer
one is that it didn't strip away the
un-- in unresponsive and maybe that's
something that you want maybe you want
to be preserving the information that
something that's responsive and
something that is unresponsive are not
exactly the same thing maybe all you
care about is just the idea that
something could be responsive so there
can be a little bit of fine-tuning here
to figure out exactly how you want to
run it but in general when you're
applying a stemmer it's going to clean
up the vocabulary of your corpus a lot
it's going to take something that can be
very very complicated you have your tens
of thousands of dimensions that
correspond to all the words in the
language and it makes something that's
much more compact you'll get a chance to
play with this in the mini project at
the end of the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
