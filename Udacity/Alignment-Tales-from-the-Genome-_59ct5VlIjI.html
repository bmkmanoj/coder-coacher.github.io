factor binding site can be pretty
difficult and usually has to be
determined empirically what that means
is we normally have to go to the lab to
figure it out but that's not always an
easy thing to do and sometimes it's a
little faster to do what we call
sequence comparisons or sequence
alignments what this means is instead of
going into the lab I'm going to take
let's say five or six different
individuals and I'm going to take the
transcription factor binding site
sequence for this person and that person
and that person and that person and I'm
going to line them all up together one
on top of the other for instance I have
these six sequences right here
hypothetically speaking of course from
six different individuals and when you
line them all up like this hopefully
what you notice first off is that there
are very few differences in the overall
sequences but at any given position you
can see that there's a dominant
nucleotide in that column we call this
the consensus or the agreement right
because most of the letters in that
column are one letter or another so what
I want you to try to do right now is
looking at these six sequence alignments
tell me what you think the consensus
sequence is for this transcription
factor binding site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
