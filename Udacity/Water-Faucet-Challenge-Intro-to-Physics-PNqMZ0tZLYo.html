this is a problem that I don't
necessarily expect you to be able to get
right with the knowledge you have but I
think it's a pretty interesting problem
so if you want to challenge yourself go
ahead and take a shot it's completely
optional now I want you to go to a sink
or bathroom or somewhere we have access
to a water faucet turn that faucet on
take a look at the water as it falls
down you'll notice that it doesn't look
like this as you might expect in reality
the water tapers off it gets thinner and
thinner as it falls so after its fall in
a distance why the initial radius big R
has reduced to this small R the question
here can we find a mathematical equation
that represents the radius of this
column of water as a function of Y
there's a couple key insights to make
here and first is that the water passing
through an imaginary hoop does so at a
constant rate and that is totally
confusing if I don't explain it more
what I mean is if I drew an imaginary
ring here an imaginary ring here and let
the water pass through both of them if
one liter of water is passing through
this ring every minute then one leader
must be passing through this ring to
none of the water is splashing off to
the side it's not building up in the
middle so it must be the case that the
water flow rate is constant you can also
show that this flow rate well it's equal
to the velocity of the water through a
given ring times the area the
cross-sectional area of the water at
that point so that would be PI R squared
third we have to assume that the water
when it leaves the faucet already has
some velocity it's moving downwards at
v-0 so what I want you to do is to write
an equation for the radius of this water
as a function of how far it's fallen Y
in terms of Y this initial velocity and
G the acceleration on earth which is 10
meters per second squared this question
won't be graded because it's a challenge
question but when you get your answer
you should share it with your classmates
in the forums and talk about it I think
this is really an interesting problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
