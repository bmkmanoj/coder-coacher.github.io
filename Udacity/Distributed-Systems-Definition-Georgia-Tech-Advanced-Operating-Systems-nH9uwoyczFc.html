nodes which are interconnected by a
local area network or a wide area
network and this local area network may
be implemented using twisted pair
coaxial cable and optical fiber and if
it is a wide area network it could be
implemented using a satellite
communication or microwave links and so
on and the media access protocols that
may be available for communication of
these nodes on a local area network or a
wide area network may be ATM or Ethernet
and so on and so forth that's sort of
the picture of what a distributed system
is number one number two there's no
physical memory that is shared between
nodes of the distributed system so the
only way nodes can communicate with one
another is by sending messages on the
local area network to one another so
there is no shared memory for
communication between the nodes of the
distributed system no physical memory
for communication between the nodes of
the distributed system and the third
property is the fact that the even
computation time that is the time it
takes on a single node to do some
meaningful processing that computation
time is what we according as an event
computation time that is te and a node
may also communicate with other nodes in
the system and that's what we are
calling as a communication time or the
messaging time TM and the third property
of a distributed system is that the time
for communication between nodes in the
system TM is much more a significantly
larger than the event communication
plane so these are the three properties
which I would like to think of to make
sure that we have a shared understanding
of what we mean by a distributed system
that they are connected by some sort of
a local area network or a wide area
network a collection of nodes and they
don't physically share memories so the
only communication only way they can
communicate with one another is we are
messages that are sent between the nodes
using the local area network and the
third property is the fact that the
message communication time
is significantly larger than even
computation time that happens on a
single note
you probably remember our good friend
Leslie Lamport I introduced you to him
when we talked about parallel systems
and I said that we will see him again in
parallel systems he's the one who gave
us the notion of sequential consistency
and he is the same person that we're
going to be talking about in this
lecture Leslie Lamport
and in particular Lamport has a
definition for a distributed system and
the definition of a distributed system
verbatim goes like this a system is
distributed if the message transmission
time TN is not negligible to the time
between events in a single process so
this is the time between events in a
single process is a message transmission
time and so the definition that Leslie
Lamport gives us that a system is
distributed is a message transmission
time TM is not negligible compared to
the time between events in a single
process what is the implication of this
definition interestingly even a cluster
is a distributed system by this
definition we will talking about
clusters a lot when we discuss parallel
systems and I told you that clusters are
the workhorses of data centers today
even a cluster is a distributed system
by this definition because processors
have become blazingly fast and so the
event computation time has shrunk quite
a bit on the other hand the message
communication time is also becoming
better but not as fast as the
computation time that happens on a
single processor and therefore even in a
cluster which is all contained in a
single rack in a data center that
message transmission time is
significantly more than the event time
and so even a cluster is a distributed
system by this definition the importance
of this inequality is in the design of
algorithms that are going to span the
nodes of the network what we want to
make sure because the message
transmission time is so significantly
larger than the event computation time
on a single node in structuring
applications that run on distributed
nodes of a system like this one has to
be very careful to make sure that the
computation time
in the algorithms actually designing is
significantly more than the
communication time otherwise we are not
going to reap the benefits of
parallelism if most of the time you're
communicating that's the reason why this
definition of distributive system is
extremely important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
