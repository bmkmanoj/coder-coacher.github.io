we'll store in the password file will
stay how have the users will have an
extra column that will call the salt and
then we'll store the encrypted password
what the salt is is random bits they
don't need to be kept secret for the
UNIX scheme there were 12 random bits
and they're different for each user
that's why this stored in the table so
if we had so for user Ellis let's say we
have the salt 0 1 1 1 1 which is an
apparently random sequence what we'll
store as the encrypted password is the
result of hashing the salt concatenated
with Alice's password and there are
different ways of doing this
some hash functions can be modified to
behave differently based on another
parameter but if it's a simple hash
function that just takes an input well
we can make the input the salt
concatenate with the password and then
for Bob we'll do the same thing but
we'll have a different sequence of
random bits and so here what we're
storing is the result of hashing Bob
salt which is this selection of random
bits concatenated with Bob's password
this means as long as the salts are
different even if the passwords are the
same the encrypted passwords will be
different and this is very similar to
what UNIX what standard UNIX systems did
where H is actually using DES encryption
25 times using the salt to modify how
the encryption happens and the password
is the key and the initial input as 0 so
to see if you understand the impact of
salting I have two quizzes so the
question is how much harder does adding
salt make it for an attacker who
compromises a password file who just
wants to learn Alice's password the
possible answers are not much harder at
all about twice as hard as it would be
without the salt and about 2 to the 12
which is 4096 times harder than it would
be without the salt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
