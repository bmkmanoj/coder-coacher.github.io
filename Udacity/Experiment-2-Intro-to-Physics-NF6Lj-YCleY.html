experimentalist so let's go back to Pisa
and repeat his experiment go back at the
Leaning Tower of Pisa and we're going to
carry out one of Galileo's famous motion
experiments so we've already bought the
equipment we set up the experiment now
all that's left to do is to carry it out
what I'm going to be doing is rolling
this hollow cylinder down this incline
plane I've divided this plane into four
sections equally spaced and I'm going to
be timing how long it takes the cylinder
to roll through each section so that
will require four separate measurements
instead of dripping water to measure
time I'm going to be using a piece of
equipment Galileo didn't have access to
an app on my cell phone
we've got our data now we'll have to
repeat this experiment several times so
that we can ensure accuracy then we can
analyze now you're going to do the
experiment yourself this experiment
you're going to need the proper
equipment so first it will need
something flat and that could be a piece
of wood like you just saw me use or it
could even be something as simple as a
book you're also going to need a
measuring device this could be a meter
stick or a tape measure or anything else
that measures distance you'll need
something to roll and it should be
either spherical or cylindrical and
you'll need a timing device something
that measures in seconds and you can
download these or find one in your net
very easily finally you'll need
something to prop your flat object up
this could just be in a book that you
stick underneath your flat object or
maybe a piece of wood doesn't matter
just the purpose is to make this into an
incline it's actually do this experiment
first you're going to need to measure
four equally spaced intervals on your
flat object and actually it doesn't
matter what you need to use these could
be a one meter or it could be two
centimeters as long as you're consistent
as long as the spacing is the same each
time and you're going to start taking
time measurements so for each of these
four distances you'll want to time how
long it takes the ball to roll from the
starting point to the end point and
actually it's not enough to do this just
once for each distance you'll want to
repeat your measurement multiple times
how many is up to you i would suggest
four or five what you'll then enter into
this data table is your average time and
the average deviation of those time
measurements you'll enter those numbers
here since you now know how to compute
averages and average deviations and then
later in the class we'll do some data
analysis with the class data on these
distance measurements note one thing
this experiment is done slightly
differently than Galileo did it we're
not letting the ball roll for a fixed
period of time and then measuring the
distance we're letting the ball roll for
a fixed distance up to 1 or up to 2 and
then measuring the time but this is an
equally good way to do this experiment
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
