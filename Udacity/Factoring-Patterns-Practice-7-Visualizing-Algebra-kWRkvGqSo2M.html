this was an example of a perfect square
practice problem did you get the right
answer congratulations if you did let's
see how we got that answer remember
whenever I factor any polynomial I want
to look to see if there's a greatest
common factor when I look at the
variables i can see there's not a
variable portion of a greatest common
factor but i notice 1884 and 98 are all
even numbers since they're all even
numbers i know that there is a greatest
common factor of 2 so the first thing i
want to do is factor out the two when i
factor out the greatest common factor of
2 i'm left with 9a squared minus 42 a B
plus 49 B squared what I notice when I
look at this problem is at the first
term and the last term are perfect
squares let me write it that way 9a
squared can be written as the quantity
3a squared 49 B squared can be written
as the quantity 7b quantity squared when
I see a perfect square in the first term
and a perfect square in the second term
I have to check to see if the middle
term is 2 times the square root of the
first term times the square root of the
last term let's check two times 3a times
7 b is equal to 21 times two is 42 a be
so we know that this is a perfect square
since the first term is 3a squared in
the last term is 7 b squared and the
middle term is 2 times the square root
of the first term times the square root
of the last term I know it's a perfect
square now knowing that it's a perfect
square I have to remember the formula
the square root of the first term is 3a
I need a minus because the middle term
is minus and then the square where the
last term which is 7b and we square it
now a good thing to do when you're doing
these factoring problems is to check
your answer when you check your answer
let's foil this out 3a minus 7 b squared
is 38 minus 7 b times 3a minus 7 b
3a times 3a is 9a squared 3a times
negative 7 b is negative 21 a be
negative 7 b times 3a is negative 21 a B
and negative 7 b times negative 7 B is
positive 49 B squared so i can combine
the two middle terms i can also multiply
it through by two when i finish
multiplying through by the GCF i get 18
a squared minus 80 for a B+ 98 B squared
which is what we started with so we know
that we got the right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
