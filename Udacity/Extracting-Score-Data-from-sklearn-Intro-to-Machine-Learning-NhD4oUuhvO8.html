and intercept I'm going to go back to
these few lines what I'm doing here is
printing out some performance metrics on
both my test data set and also my
training data set just for a point of
comparison remember the test data set
actually provides the numbers that we're
going to trust let me go back over here
in the next few videos we'll be talking
pretty exhaustively about the
performance metrics that you can use to
evaluate your regressions but let me
give you a sneak preview here one
performance metric that we'll talk about
is something called r-squared and to
make a long story short the higher your
r-squared is the better r-squared has a
maximum value of 1 and so what we can do
is we can ask for this regression that
we've just made how good is our
r-squared we want to be asking that
question of our test data set if we ask
it of our training data set we'll also
get some interesting information but
only by using the test data set can we
be sensitive to things like overfitting
so when I go over here and I look at the
values of my r-squared score for my test
data set and then also my training data
set for comparison I get a little bit of
information about how well my regression
is performing I said the maximum value
is 1.0 the maximum value for R squared
is 1.0 so since I'm getting 0.8 1 on the
test dataset and 0.87 on the training
data set I'm actually not doing too
badly so rather than talking about
r-squared anymore let's go back to the
tablet and we'll talk some more about
the types of errors that you can have on
regressions and how you can quantify
them so you really understand what these
numbers mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
