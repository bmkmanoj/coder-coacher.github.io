refer to an input image as F index over
I and J output as G and H I J is the
kernel and these are the terms you'll be
using again and again throughout some of
the stuff we deal with image processing
again let's take our nine by time nine
by nine sample image this is our three
by three kernel with K is equal to one
just to help us do some simple math I'm
now going to take a element here with
the neighborhood with you know I and J
at 3 so basically now looking for value
of G the output at 3 we want to figure
out what was the Matt for coming up with
this and I've given it some variables a
b c d e f g h i just to kind of mirror
the lowercase ones here for generality
let's just now play around with just
these two for now and again this is the
one that is basically moving around
inside this so g 3 3 the value here and
the output would therefore be the
summation of a lowercase a with capital
a lowercase B capital B and doing that
for each and every elements the nine
elements here so this would be my
equation now since there are nine of
these I do want to always normalize it
so actually I would come up with a
scaling factor one over nine to help me
kind of normalize the values from all of
them for the case of just doing a filter
that's an average so right now to do an
average my kernel would just be 1 over 9
1 over 9 1 over 9 same values and all on
9 elements so now if I do 1 over 9 and
this is my image here of course the
averaging would be best defined by this
equation so G 3 3 basically for in
kernel which is an average kernel 1 over
9 on all the nine elements would be 1
over night and the summation of all of
them very similar to what we had looked
in the 1d case now applied to a 2d case
