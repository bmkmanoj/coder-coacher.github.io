about parallelized
we're going to use a running example to
illustrate the concepts that we'll go
through over the rest of this unit and
that example is matrix transposed it's a
very simple algorithm that still has
enough meat in it to illustrate a lot of
the points we want to bring up matrix
transpose just take some matrix and
exchanges the rows and columns so a
particular element in this row for
example would have coordinate a comma B
so it's I coordinate is a it's J corn is
B and it's new I coordinate and the
transpose matrix will be B and its new
jcore and it will be a pretty simple and
to make our code even simpler we're
actually gonna restrict ourselves to
square matrices now you'll remember that
you know this came up all the way back
in unit 2 is a really common parallel
communication pattern so you know
transposing a matrix or doing some
equivalent operation on an array or an
image or a structure of arrays this
comes up literally all the time so this
is even though it's a simple example as
you'll see there's a lot of opportunity
to optimize it and it's a really
important one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
