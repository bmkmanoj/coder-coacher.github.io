implementing methods let me show you a
technique that can help you understand
what a method implementation does it's
called the object tracing technique so
let's say that you have a couple of
methods that do some work that may not
be so easy to understand here's what you
do pick some scenario that exercises
these methods like here I'm making a car
I add gas I drive it in a driver a bit
more and now we want to understand what
do these method calls do to the car
it's very low-tech get yourself an index
card or a napkin or some other piece of
paper make a column for each instance
variable so let's get started
I put the paperclip so we can see where
we are we construct a car that
initializes the instance variables I
didn't have room to put in the code for
the constructor but hopefully you
remember the gas in tank and miles
driven I initialized to zero the miles
per gallon with the parameter and the
constructor let's move on now we enter
the add gas method here amount is 30 gas
and tank is zero so the effect just said
now gas and tank is set to 30 moving on
now we drive 10 miles so distance is 10
and since this method is a bit longer
and it has another local variable here
it makes sense to make another card for
it or actually since I ran out of
simulated cards argues a napkin
so the distance parameter is 10 R here
we update miles driven previously it was
zero we add to 10 that's not yet now
here we compute the gas consumed
that's another local variable I put it
on my napkin it's the distance divided
by miles per gallon 10 divided by 10 so
we consumed a gallon now we can look at
this statement here gas and tank was
dirty gas consumed was 1 the difference
is 29 so that should now be moved into
gas and tank now we're at the end of
this method call and the local variable
here and the parameter variable go away
so we can just crumple up our napkin
here these variables are no longer there
once we exited this method of course the
instance variables the long-term memory
of the object they stay around now here
we are in the next method call we're
calling the drive method again that
means that this local variable has this
one here will get recreated of course
this time the distance is 20 now let's
see miles driven is miles driven plus
distance
previously it was ten now we at twenty
not becomes thirty gas consumed is
distance over miles driven that's twenty
by ten or two gas and tank was twenty
nine minus two is twenty seven so now
we've executed the three steps in this
method this method is not finished and
once again the local variables go away
and we're done and this is the remaining
state of the object what's the point by
doing this exercise you gain an
understanding of what the statements and
the methods do through the instance
variables of an object Sara will walk
you through an example on how you can
use this technique to find a bug in a
method implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
