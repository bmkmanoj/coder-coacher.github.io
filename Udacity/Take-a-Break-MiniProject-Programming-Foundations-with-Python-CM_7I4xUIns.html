will click on the discussion thread with
a star now the star means that I created
this thread for you to submit your
responses once the discussion forum has
opened you can simply scroll down and
add a youtube link right here to the
discussions you will notice that there
is a YouTube video that is embedded
right within the discussion forum there
now let's talk about how to upload a
photo to do that I will click on this
tiny photo icon and then simply upload a
photo from my computer that's the one I
want to upload and you will notice that
much like the YouTube video the photo is
also uploaded right here within the
discussion forums let me hit submit and
then so here I am back to the mini
project which is for you to teach the
program that we have written together to
a friend or a colleague we also want you
to use your smartphone to record a video
of your conversation and then share that
YouTube video with us on the discussion
forum oh by the way if you are unable to
record a video we would love to see some
photos or some text describing your
conversation with your friend after you
have submitted your responses on the
forum make sure you check this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
