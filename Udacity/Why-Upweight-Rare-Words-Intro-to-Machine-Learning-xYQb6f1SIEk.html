emails that some of them came for me and
some of them came from Sebastian we
might have a lot of overlap we might
both be talking about machine learning
and Udacity but some of them are gonna
be talking about let's say physics
because that's what my background is in
and that's going to be comparatively
rare there's not going to be tons and
tons of emails in that corpus that are
talking about physics because most all
of Sebastian's are don't talk about
physics at all it's only going to be
mine and then likewise maybe there's a
bunch of emails to talk about Stanley
the robot which of course is one of his
projects but not something that I'm a
real expert in so the fact that words
like physics and Stanley would be rare
in this corpus compared to words like
Udacity or machine learning means that
these might be the words that tell you
the most important information about
what's going on who might be the author
of a given message and so another way to
think about that is that this is why
it's called the inverse document
frequency that you want to weight the
words by the inverse of how often they
appear in the corpus as a whole I'm not
going to have you code an example of
tf-idf right now as a quiz but this is
something that we're going to cover in
the mini project that's coming up very
shortly at the end of this lesson so you
will get your hands dirty with this
representation a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
