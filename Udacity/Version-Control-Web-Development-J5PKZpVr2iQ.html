version control yes and what it is and
which ones you should use because there
are quite a few out okay sure so Peter
this is purely subjective answer but
that's why you're here I guess right um
I use get I would recommend everybody
use get its really really nice you know
I use CBS back in the day and then
subversion replace that then mercurial
replace that and now now I use get and
it's great and basically the whole that
whole notion is you had the source
direct and you make you know you're
making changes the files and you can log
what those changes are what they were
for you can go back in history you can
merge change it together you can be
working with multiple people and merge
your changes together and so it's a
great way to share code between multiple
computers it's a great way to keep track
of your development you know I do it for
example and Udacity I've got a get
folder or get project for all of the
courses I'm or for all the files i'm
using for you guys for my blog and
occasionally and i have these different
branches for different homework so i can
be you know recording unit six and then
working on homework three and i can
switch between those two states of the
code really easily and then I can you
know check out the homework three branch
and tore it up and put it online for you
guys and then I can go back you know
back into the future to homework 6 you
know that sort of thing so it's really
handy and it's very fast it's really
good I was written by alyna store vol.2
also wrote Linux he's a pretty confident
guy I don't really so so i would suggest
get you can use github github it's like
a third party site for storing a code if
you want to start a remote location we
use get help for hipmunk for example and
read it incidentally so there you go
short answer is get so many tells you
different raise an eyebrow great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
