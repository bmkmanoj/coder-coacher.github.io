person I've learned from more than I can
describe he's a successful true
entrepreneur having started seven
companies that made it past vanilla
market cap including epiphany reason was
reason one he's a world-class instructor
his teachings are being adopted by more
than 50 universities and he's hands down
the best market here in Silicon Valley
just amazing but he couldn't be here
today so they got me he's innovative
when it comes to coupling Billings he
can sell you anything do ganas
he also innovative attempts of teaching
is dedicated teacher teaching at
Stanford most recent course was called
hacking for defense where you did what
so hacking for defense was basically a
way to solve problems that are facing
our country to keep us safe and secure
that our department defense and
intelligence community have we're
dealing with threats in the 21st century
that they never imagined in the 20th
century and if n view dealt with the
government you know they're still using
quills somewhere in the in the
organization and they're used to buying
aircraft carriers that take thirty five
years to acquire and process etc yet
some of the threats like Isis and
al-qaeda and others are just occurring
overnight and the organizational
structures and the solutions they have
and the people they have to start used
to dealing with what we deal with in
Silicon Valley all the time is 24/7
innovation and so we took the Lean
Startup methodology that is how to
operate at speed by understanding
problems and then getting out and
talking to customers and stakeholders in
this case warfighters making sure we
understand the problem and then build
this
and so we went out the Department of
Defense got some real-world toughest
problems and basically put them online
for our students and allow students to
work on in ten weeks to see if they
understand problems go out and talk to a
hundred customers partners stakeholders
people with money contractors you know
others and build Minimum Viable products
for different branches of the department
defense intelligence community we
started the class last June
ran it as an experiment it was so
successful last month this january eight
other universities are now teaching it
will have 15 universities online
teaching it by the end of this year and
hopefully it'll match what we did to the
National Science Foundation and have 50
some-odd universities solving real-world
problems for department defense
intelligence community with the
unintended consequence of the sponsors
that people give us the problem are
watching this methodology and raised and
now they're raising their hand and
saying can you come in and teach us how
to think and operate at this speed with
this process so that's what hacking for
defenseless you mentioned Lean Startup
yes and you wrote a book on this that's
opposed if Tiffany you're going to serve
it great book by the way highly
recommend it and then you've taught a
course on Udacity on this yes tell us
about it so so the four steps to the
Epiphany kind of kicked off the what's
called the Lean Startup movement it
articulated one of the three pieces of
what eventually became lean the customer
development process of how you actually
get outside the building and start
talking to people who you think want to
buy your product someday or have the
problem you want to solve a mistake we
used to make in the 20th century in
Silicon Valley and others is just assume
I have an idea and I have an idea rest
write up a business plan turn into
slides try to raise some money build the
product shift the product no one buys
the product fire your head of sales fire
your head of the marketing you know
founder becomes chief technical officer
or something and then you know like go
out of business and and I said perhaps
we ought to before we like go from
vision to PowerPoint slides we might
want to validate some of those
hypotheses and in fact the key idea was
Valene was understanding that we had
built tools for a hundred years in
business schools about how to execute
known processes that is business schools
created you know the strategy and
operations etc all assuming that all you
had was a process for execution that's
all you needed to do no one ever noticed
that startups actually weren't an
execution mode they were actually
searching to validate whether these
things were true or not that they really
expected this thing the affiliate one
that's right so that's the answer your
original question is I created a new
class at Stanford called the lean
launchpad which was adopted by the US
National Science Foundation and then
every federal research agency in the
u.s. now mandates this as a class you
have to watch the Udacity videos if
you're a scientist who wants to get an
SBIR or STTR grants that is a
commercialization grant from the US you
have to go through the Udacity income
videos to kind of get funded and you go
through the class so great videos you
book you have this episode that they
remember they summon body and after
firing a head of marketing with a
business product and ask you to sell it
and I think you went to their clients
that are almost buying it and said what
did I give it to you for free yeah so so
one of the great tests is is a pricing
test is you know all everybody's excited
and they really love it and Steve it's
on our forecasts and whatever well if we
closed yet well not really so you go
into a client and go you know if I gave
you product this product for free would
you buy it yeah well and if you get a
well you realize the sales person was
just like confused and and the other
bounding box I sometimes would do is
I'll know we deploy ten thousand of them
well I was on a kidding it's a million
dollars it's a million dollars we don't
pay more than three hundred and fifty
thousand three hundred fifty thousand
dollars and they have literally told you
what the upper end of the comic box was
and by the way that works like because
more times than you would believe the
other thing I teach my students is when
they're out ghost
everybody loves the thing they loved our
slides your Minimum Viable Product did
you ask them
much money they have in their wallet
what did you ask them for an order well
it's not done well they told you they
love it and they do and the great way to
get somebody out of their offices this
is great when you have it come on back
well okay
why don't you just say empty your wallet
I'll put it in an envelope I'll seal the
envelope and I won't spend any money but
since you love the product I'll spend it
when I deliver the product 90% of the
time well I really didn't mean I loved
it that much so in customer development
you find out a lot of stuff about
outside the building but I have to tell
you one of the best things that did
happen to me was being a Udacity course
which i think is EP 245 on Udacity like
because it allowed me to reach students
and students to understand what was
going on in Silicon Valley thinking
about when you startups and at a scale
and a reach that just wasn't possible I
have dozens of emails that students
wrote me and say I watched these blanks
class you just safe behind this if you
tell another funding I would have
business stupid thing over here and then
I asked my future customers first which
cost me like a day and realize this is
the wrong solution for them who essence
is in astana ba is aspiring to be in the
startup company good number how you
recommend it what Steve has done is turn
the entire process upside down but most
of us do is we wake up in the morning
we're geniuses
and you're going to invent this amazing
thing and then we started working on it
and as we work on it we put our sweat
and heart into it and after half a year
we are unable to admit to ourselves it
might be completely useless and then you
go out and go to people and take it take
it take it and Steve's class he makes
you go to customers and don't even show
them what you're doing but ask him what
he want and try to understand deeply
their problem because you might be
solving your problem but you might not
really understand their problem and in
some cases they might not even
understand what their own problem is so
you know and and Sebastian you missed
one thing that smart people do is that
not only do you have this great
idea and start building it but you put
in every possible feature you could
imagine people are going to want
and so when you ship it that you're
surprised that people want to use you
know feature 12 you know 19 and 27 and
the rest of it is just waste as Eric
Ries called that waste the Lean Startup
ended up being as I started earlier my
contribution was customer development
Alexander Osterwalder added something
called the business model canvas and
Eric Ries smartest student I ever had in
a classroom was the one who realized
that agile engineering not waterfall was
the perfect match to the customer
development process and that stack
business model design customer
development and natural engineering is
what's called the Lean Startup when
applied to you know startups or now
companies are now government agencies
trying to move at speed and search for
things that might not be obvious what
the solution is I left them up for
question from the audience that these
line up behind it two microphones over
there and then you speak speak with it
so see this is inviting me anything
except for funding yeah pick it out make
it ass but now I don't like the snow so
it's a lie on that murder I wanted to be
the the youngest thief the 18 year old
Steve from high school okay you don't
have to tell me everything you did but
what advice would be give to yourself
from today's perspective yeah volunteer
for everything so my whole career was
turning the common wisdom on its head
one is as Sebastian mentions a an
adjunct professor at Stanford in the
engineering school I teach at Berkeley
in the business school I'm a senior
fellow at Columbia and never graduated
from college yeah I ran and so my
education at eighteen was I joined the
US Air Force during Vietnam and spent
four years in Southeast Asia learning at
high speed in in sheer chaos and terror
sometimes and so but I did reverse the
standard military advice was you never
volunteer for anything and I learned
that's just wrong yeah you might end up
cleaning root latrines which i did when
i vont
sometimes but I also ended up learning
some spectacular stuff and the other
pieces show up more than anybody else I
would show up more you know I'd work
harder and I'd be there when they were a
blank he keeps showing up okay you over
here you know half the time they were
crummy things to do but the other half
the time I got opportunities and jobs
and careers and this goes for anybody
looking for a career show up be present
work hard and by the way the third thing
is speak up for yourself well we love to
think the world is a meritocracy you
need to be clear and articulate about
what you accomplish and more importantly
what you want to do I remember being a
my first Jobs was a training instructors
teaching microprocessor design at a
startup called zilog and the manager
training at education had just gotten
fired and there were all of us sitting
on training department looking around
who's going to manage our group and
finally I realized I could be a good
manager and walked into the VP of Sales
who ran the department and said I want
to run the training department of teach
microprocessor design and the rest and
he said what took you so long
when we expected you in here two weeks
ago asking for the job and that was like
a key lesson for me as well you think
maybe know whatever ask for what you
want because the only the worst thing
that could happen is you get an L so I
know you asked one question but that
typical market here fills up the whole
room he said oh that hi thanks for
taking my question so I founded a
startup and we had some technical I had
engineers come on board and we sold the
product and we had clients Genentech and
VMware big companies and we ran it for
about five years profitably and we never
got venture money and we were actually
pretty proud of that
just in January we decided to close it
down because every time we looked at the
future and we looked at funding in order
to grow it it seemed like we couldn't
make the numbers work and we still had
paying clients when we closed it down
did we miss something
sure so so what is you know and
certainly in Silicon Valley we tend to
think everything has angel or venture
capital around it and there are some
classes of businesses
and in fact you should run the model in
hindsight it's just kind of when you get
some distance to think about could this
thing of scaled with risk capital which
is essentially what angel or
professional venture capitalist that is
you don't take money because you could
get money you take money because is
there value in accelerating hiring or
sales people or equipments or scale
could this thing have turned out
differently at scale first
you know post-mortem think to write
there are other things that just don't
necessarily scale in fact if you think
about in the US according to US
Department of Labor ninety-nine point
seven percent of all companies in the US
are under five hundred people that's
what we actually in the u.s. defined as
small businesses and small businesses
still make up Main Street
entrepreneurship and most of them are
not scalable there and you might have
actually could run the analysis of there
Steve it was a small business at its
core and we ran it a small business we
made the money we had a great time but
it was not a scalable business and so
the first question you need to ask is am
i building a small business no shame in
that that's actually what most in fact
Michael that's what normal people do
okay either build small businesses or go
they work for come real companies it's
only crazy people who inhabits Silicon
Valley and entrepreneur clusters who are
usually unemployable by anybody else I
think that's right both of us are
sitting up here and the good news is
that you know like it's fun the bad news
is you like you know it it it becomes
your life rather than a job did I answer
a question yes you did yeah thanks
no thank you for taking my question and
thank you for being here I actually use
your course in a course that I teach at
the junior college we teach a computer
science program and then into the AAA
degree I have a final projects class and
I bring in guest speakers and I run
videos and then I haven't watched your
your class and to bring in some insight
taking the principles that you have
developed for lings
and cool things look what do you see the
impact of education as a whole because
there's a lot of things that are coming
down the state incur
development and accountability in
measurements and this major measure that
and what is the demographic and all
these other things that are getting
measured but they're all on different
scales so we're not going to get
anything intelligent it's just me noise
so I'm going to answer a question and in
a very funny way yeah specifically about
teaching innovation entrepreneurship you
know when I started teaching my friends
the John Rubinstein who used to run
hardware engineering at Apple and then
pomme who I knew for decades looked at
me as an educator in the last
hysterically said Steven you can't teach
entrepreneurship you were born
entrepreneur you know like you can't
teach people how to be entrepreneurs and
I thought about that I said well that's
funny I am teaching entrepreneurship and
but it troubled me for decades because
people actually ask that question a lot
and it turns out we were asking the
wrong question question isn't whether
you could teach entrepreneurship the
question is who can you teach it to this
is a big idea because the mistake is is
that thinking that entrepreneurship is
the same as being a Java programmer or
an accountant or something else if you
want to start something you're closer to
an artist than any other profession you
see things that other people don't you
hear things that other people don't
artists see a you see a blank canvas
they see starry night you see a 12-foot
block of marble they already see the
Pieta and that just need to remove the
stone so for five hundred years we've
understood that artists can actually be
trained but you can't assign somebody
the job of sculptor or painter or
composer something inside them but you
could teach them but we also realized a
hundred years ago that teaching art
appreciation to the entire community is
actually valuable not only to the artist
because they'll have people to buy their
stuff but more importantly to society in
general I think the area exact parallels
about entrepreneurship education that is
for people who desperately want to
become entrepreneurs you will fight your
way into finding entrepreneurial
education opportunities but for the rest
of you whether you're in a corporation
or your senior manager or somebody just
interested in college and understanding
business in the 21st century
we ought to have the equivalent of
entrepreneurship appreciation classes
just why do we spread out for our
culture so that's my best answer mean
the people who in my you I'm sorry the
Stevens defense up let this thing
fanclub is the Sebastian fan club or the
you on must fan club or the or the Steve
Jobs fan club of in fact think about it
we now understand that it's great to
expose students to music and painting
and whatever when they're in elementary
school and my point is we should expose
students in the same way from elementary
all the way through k12 let alone
college about what entrepreneurship is
and why it's different big idea why it's
different than ending up teaching
students about how to set up a lemonade
stand it used to be the only K through
12 business classes that you would get
is oh let's teach them how to set up a
lemonade stand
that's not entrepreneurship that's how
to set up a lemonade stand does that
make sense yes
alright so firstly I you know I'm really
glad that I'm here it's awesome to hear
from you guys and it's way inspirational
what I was wondering is I imagine you
know since you've blury like we're in
the book on entrepreneurship you've
interacted with so many businesses what
is the craziest problem or challenge
that you had to address and how did you
tackle that working with businesses or
with your own business what's the
craziest problem that I've ever seen
yeah yeah actually the craziest problem
was in one of our last classes actually
was hacking for defense problem any of
you heard of the Navy SEALs
the underwater divers and turned out the
medical director of Navy SEALs gave us a
problem and the problem was the seals
were spending too much time underwater
and they were getting the bends and
whatever and so the medical director for
the Navy SEALs said here's the problem
for your class you need to design some
carbon dioxide sensors that the seals
could wear so they could figure out you
know they need to stop diving and that's
pretty definable problem students were
excited mechanical engineers and and
computer people join the class they
formed the team they interviewed the
director he defined the problem and of
course the first people they went out
and talked to were the Navy SEALs who
said really you're going to strap new
sensors on us to tell us that we can't
die huh really
he said well yeah you know it's a zero
902 yes everybody synchronize your
watches at zero 904 those sensors would
be at the bottom of the effing ocean and
so King came back with a real problem
but they were smart enough to ask here's
the big idea they asked the seals wow
that's interesting why are you spending
all the time underwater well glad you
asked because no one else has our
problem is we don't know where we are in
3d space there is no GPS unless we're
near the surface if you could make us a
deployable GPS buoy when we're a hundred
feet under the water we be spend into
like a third less time so they went back
to medical director and said the problem
is not a medical problem the problem is
a 3d geolocation problem and that's what
they spent the next nine weeks working
on that answer
on December
I suspect behave only time for one more
question and who is the best question so
that's the best question No thank you
nope no pressure no pressure
so you're new to this in your book and
in your talk today as well sometimes
it's a challenge to elicit what the
business really wants or yes awesome
really wants yes what have you learned
ever since you've written the book that
has changed your views or something new
that you have learned that can help and
budding entrepreneur get that from their
customers well that there's that
everything I've written Eric Ries is
written the Design Thinking School
Stanford everybody's written a lot about
how to kind of understand customer
problems and I guess the the biggest
thing I could offer is there's a ton of
tools to do that but this is over time
what what makes the entrepreneurial
fingertip feel meaning you get good at
first over practice and the other thing
I'll suggest for any of you thinking
about a startup your first idea is
almost always wrong about what the
customer wants go a sebastien up what
but but it's less so am i nailing it
understanding it right but but what you
do when you find it out and that's
called the pivot Eric Ries named it but
but I drew it he named it and I think
the pivots a key idea about this whole
process is after you get repeatable data
and by the way when you're getting the
data it doesn't come in the form of a
memo that says you're wrong or your
assumptions are wrong it just comes with
chaotic sometimes it says you're right
but sometimes the stuff isn't like the
up-sales aren't working and whatever
usually the first sign your job is to
make sense out of you're looking for
signals out of noise and your job is to
take that and make a substantive change
and a pivot is iteration without crisis
you know Udacity is a perfect example of
that we had a good amount of try SpaceX
pivoted and Tesla did so little pivots
with SpaceX did into some massive pivots
and great founders by the way always
reinvent the past oh we have planned
that although Ola yeah oh yeah honestly
BAE was
exactly going to look like this and
SpaceX was Udacity you know we rewrote
history and I know you talked about I
know you have it yeah but my point is
great founders pivot and then kind of
have this past amnesia where their new
marketeers that tend to create a new
persona of what what happened but that's
why - I'll start into 21st century sure
tips to operate it's with speed and
urgency and so thank you for the
question
I think it was repellent it I want to I
want to thank Steve you're one of my
heroes and you can probably understand
why I always lost let's listen to him
and learn from him we have a class
online if you care about it you can buy
his book and he's very available you
guys to block with vidi-vidi interesting
Steve Blank calm sea plane calm and for
all of you this is I think this is
Silicon Valley pure you got half an hour
of one of the most amazing men on the
planet
thank you Steve Thank You Sebastian okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
