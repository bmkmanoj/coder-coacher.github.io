that's where landscape changes
constantly the technology change
constantly you know how does one become
a successful cyber security professional
from your perspective I guess I'm sure
you have a thought about what it means
to be a successful this hyper security
professional on your side well I think
to be successful means it you can't
stand still to stand still is to get
left behind so you have to have a
passion for the discipline and to really
be a constant learner learner and being
able to think creatively and consume and
learn and create new things and also be
interested in how take things apart and
push technologies in ways that they
weren't intended I also think that we
successfully have to be trustworthy
because by studying information security
you're learning effectively dangerous
skills that you have to use wisely
people will put their trust in to you
and you have to respect that that's
really key probably the key underpinning
the whole the whole discipline a
willingness to teach others about this
in a way that's it's the right language
yeah taking a step back out so you have
to be able to communicate technical
subjects to non-technical audiences in a
way that's understandable and meaningful
how you communicate with potentially
board of directors there's a whole
lexicon of how you communicate with
senior business leaders or senior
military leaders or students at varies
so you have to be very adaptive and be
willing to learn and respect the
cultures which you're trying to interact
with and positively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
