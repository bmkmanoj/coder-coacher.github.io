trellis or lattice plot is a series of
charts laid out in a grid they often
represent common data faceted by
different categories in this case we
have engineering operations accounting
HR IT and manufacturing on the x axis we
have different months of the year and on
the y axis we have different salary
expenses for each department I really
love small multiple plots because you
can embed any type of chart and they
generalize to any type of comparison
here we've embedded line plots to show
how salary expenses vary over months of
the year for each department but we
could have just as easily embedded
different histograms maps or even pie
charts the small multiple was
popularized and coined by Edward Tufte a
leader in the field of data
visualization will learn more about him
later in the lesson and we'll hear about
him throughout the course box plots are
another technique to visualize multiple
distributions in one graphic just like a
small multiple a series of box plots
allow us to visualize different
distributions all in one graphic the box
plot was invented by John to key and
comes from the field of exploratory data
analysis while small multiple and box
plots are often used for exploratory
data analysis to learn how your data is
distributed they can also be used to
convey certain points and relationships
between your data and your variables for
example in the box plot here we have a
series of experiments one two three four
and five measuring the speed of light
and for each experiment we take a series
of measurements that are visualized as a
single box plot here we can see the
quartile ranges and the mean and we can
plot the side by side to see what we
likely believe the speed of light to be
after our series of experiments you can
see here the true speed of light is
actually plotted in the red line and is
quite a bit lower and all the
experiments shown here just one last
point and the difference between ed
a-and data visualization typically an
eda you're trying to discover some
information about your data for yourself
or as with a data visualization you're
trying to communicate some information
most your data to others depending on
your intention you can use both box
plots and small multiples to either
learn more about your data or try to
convey something to others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
