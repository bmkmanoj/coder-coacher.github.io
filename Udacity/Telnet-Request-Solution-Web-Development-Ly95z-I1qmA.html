header was this URL I Anna dot org slash
domain slash example okay
I'll walk through how I found the
answers and hopefully you did something
similar so we go to our terminal
and we said example.com so let's make
that request tell them that to dub dub
dub dot example.com 480 okay now say git
slash HTTP slash 1.0 host dub dub dub
dot example.com uh-huh nice simple
response we can see our status code is
three zero two and we can see our
location header is right here
Anna dot org if that didn't work you
know here's how you do it alright so
let's let's play around a little bit
more so we see that this is a redirect
sponsor response because it was status
code three zero two and it's saying the
actual content is here let's give a shot
at making the request to find this we're
going to tell that to I Anna org and
make a request for this path and see how
it goes see if we can get it to hundred
we make the request to Ayana org telnet
to dub dub dub hi Anna
chord fort 80 and we say get / domain /
example AC / 1.0 okay so here we are you
can see where I telnet it into Hana org
and you can see the request I made for /
domain / example I use the HTTP 1.0
again and you can see the response this
is actually kind of funny so responded
with HTTP 1.1 status 200 this is
actually a good example of you know the
web not lining up exactly correctly but
that's how it goes generally this 1.1
should have matched this 1.0 but since
these guys control the web I guess they
can do whatever they like okay so you
can see the common headers date you know
today actually today for me in the past
for you you can see the server header
Apache you can see it this is an
interesting header last modified

this is for caching purposes this tells
our browser that we don't need to bother
requesting this page again no we don't
need new updates if it hasn't changed
since this date content type this is
typical text HTML and below that you see
the content pretty cool huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
