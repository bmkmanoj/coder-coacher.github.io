line we're almost there just a little
bit left to go only one more slightly
difficult part here's fine crosswords
and because I can see the finish line
I'm not going to explain it line by line
but you could go ahead and read it and
two other small bits we need this list
of neighbors in the north south east
west order and we got to be able to
transpose a matrix it turns out that one
way to transpose the matrix is an old
trick is you map list to the zip of the
application of all the rows in the
matrix if that makes your head hurt
don't worry about it you can play with a
little bit to see why it works or you
could use this expression here and at j
i4 j in the range and for I in the range
now I'm excited to see it work I ran it
it did in fact work solidified the
results by putting them into a test
examples of finding crosswords finding
neighbors transpose that looks like it
works transpose of a transpose you get
back what you started with if we set
anchors on our example board we get back
the sample row that we did by hand if we
call horizontal plays we get back this
list now I feel a little bit bad here
that I wrote this as a test and yet I
can't really verify that this is exactly
the right answer I haven't gone through
every word in the dictionary to figure
out if I got this exactly right so this
serves not so much as a unit test a unit
test is something that verifies that
your function is doing the right thing
rather this serves as a regression test
regression test means that we're just
testing it to see if we broke something
so we want to get the same result this
time as we get next time if we make a
small change to our program we can
verify that this looks reasonable that
we got the big word we were looking for
backbench other components of it like
bench and then a bunch of three letter
words which always show up in scrabble
that was the horizontal plays we can
also do the all plays gratifying that
all plays is a bit longer gratifying
that back bench is still there and when
we run it it passes bird by burp you can
check off one more now there's only one
left scoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
