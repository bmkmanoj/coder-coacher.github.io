so hopefully no one picked the first
answer we usually do try to do things
the easy way there is sort of an
exception to that in this whole unit
that we're learning ourselves how to
define a hash table even though Python
provides a dictionary type which I'll
talk about at the very end of the unit
that makes things much easier than what
we're doing ourselves but we really want
to understand a lot of computer science
by building our own hash table and then
we won't actually need to use it because
there's a built-in type that works much
better but the answer is the second
answer and here's the reason why so what
happens when we evaluate this list
multiplication well we have this empty
list let's draw it like this and we
create a new list which is three copies
of that list but it's not copies it's
three references to it so here's the new
list has three elements each one of
those elements refers to the same empty
list then when we did table index 1
append well what happened is we followed
this reference to whatever table the
next one is it's this object we appended
to it added a new element but because
the reference is that position 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
all refer the same object that changed
all of those values not just the value
of table index 1 and we can see that if
we print out the whole table that the
table contains 3 elements but they're
all the same and they all refer to the
same object so any change we make to one
changes all of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
