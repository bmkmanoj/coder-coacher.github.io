creating / debugging so how can we avoid
debugging in the first place here's some
suggestions on what you can do first
thing get your requirements right only
if you know precisely what to do will
you be able to know what not to do that
is only with precise requirements will
you be able to tell failure from success
a famous quote coming from brian
kernighan without specification there
are no bugs only surprises so you could
think that if you have no specifications
and you wouldn't have to do any
debugging unfortunately surprises need
to be debugged just as well accept that
debugging surprises is harder because
you don't know how they would not
surprise you increase precision and
automation next suggestion in the end
you do have this huge program and you
want to be able to find as many bugs as
possible of course you can have
developers read it review it test it but
in the end the time of your developers
will always be a precious resource in
other words you won't have the
developers you won't have the time and
so you'll be pressed to ship anyway if
you can automate these tasks then
resources will be much less of a problem
because you can have an arbitrary number
of computers doing the checking for you
this calls for techniques such as
contracts assertions or other forms of
specification that can be validated
automatically plus of course lots of
automated testing that follows next step
is to reduce complexity the higher the
structural complexity of a program the
more ways there is for some part of a
program to influence another and the
easier it is for infections to spread
plus the higher the complexity
program the more possible sources for
infections they are and all of this
makes debugging way harder next step set
up assertions every single assertion
rules out large parts of the program or
of the program state as infection caused
and the more assertions you set up the
less state and statement do you have to
examine in order to figure out where the
infection came from next thing test
early and test often the earlier you
test the more precise your specification
will be and the more you test the more
defects you will catch right away plus
if you test frequently you will be able
to isolate the change that led to the
test failing by building on the past
history of successful tests next review
your code or have it reviewed by your
colleagues having your code being
inspected by others has been shown again
and again to significantly increase
productivity quality and project
stability next up go and analyze the
problem history of your project in order
to figure out which components have
shown risk in the past and which ones
haven't obviously components that had
troubles in the past would always be the
first one to focus on as it comes to
improving quality analyze their history
their common features common causes and
adjust the development process
accordingly last learn from your
mistakes every bug you make is a bug too
many improve your development process
such that bugs are caught as quickly as
possible if a Berg escapes into
production make sure it won't happen
