kinds of graphs we've been studying but
the real world networks that you
actually find have some distinctive
properties and these have been
documented by researchers like Duncan
Watson and others one property of these
graphs is that they tend to exhibit the
small world phenomenon which essentially
means that there's short paths between
arbitrary nodes in the graph another is
that they're cliquish which means they
exhibit a high clustering coefficient
I'm going to illustrate these two
properties next so this is me
essentially I live in Bernardsville New
Jersey this is Chris M he lives in
Wellesley Massachusetts and he's very
tall finally this is Chris s and I'm not
sure exactly where he lives but I'm
gonna say New Brunswick New Jersey so
last summer
Chris s and Chris M were both of the New
Jersey Shore at the same time and they
got together for drinks
Chris s told Chris M that he worked at
Rutgers University and Chris M said oh
do you know Michael Littman and Chris s
said actually yes
small world so it turned out that Chris
s was connected to me we both worked at
Rutgers and had worked on a project
together and Chris Metcalfe and I went
to the same undergraduate institution
and were friends doing computer science
he stuff and here these two random
people meeting in some faraway place
hundreds of miles away from where they
live and they had this connection
between them and and what we say when
this sort of thing happens is it's sort
of a small world even though there's
lots of people and lots of places people
are not as foreign to us as we might
think so the classic example of this
kind of effect was from the experiment
by Stanley Milgram he very coarsely
estimated that any person in the US was
just five or six steps away from any
other and this gave rise to what we now
think of as being the idea of six
degrees of separation in graph theoretic
terms what we say is that a graph
exhibits the small world phenomenon if
nodes have relatively small degree but
also a relatively short path to other
arbitrary
and social networks seem to exhibit
exactly this property so just to get you
thinking about the degree of different
graphs and the path lengths in different
graphs here's four different kinds of
graphs we've talked about before Creek
where all the nodes are connected to
each other a ring where the nodes are
connected into a ring a balance tree
where you have a tree structure but that
there's a node that kind of separates
the other nodes into these two different
components that are about the same size
and a hypercube like this three
dimensional hypercube and what I'd like
you to do is think about in an end node
version of that graph what is the degree
is that and what is the path length
between sort of the longest path length
in the graph as a function of the number
of nodes is it constant doesn't depend
on the number of nodes in the graph is
it logarithmic or is it linear so a
graph that has low degree might be you
know one or LOGIN and then it has short
paths might be of one or LOGIN so which
properties do these graphs exhibit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
