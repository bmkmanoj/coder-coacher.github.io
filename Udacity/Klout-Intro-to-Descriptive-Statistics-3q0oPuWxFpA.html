measure your influence across the
Internet
primarily the social media I'm chief
scientist at clout around the data
science team as well as the data
infrastructure team oversee all the data
driven products that clout you know kind
of leave the team behind the score and
you created the whole infrastructure but
in the algorithm behind the cloud score
right I create the infrastructure and
science behind the cloud score we grade
everyone's influence on the internet
from a scale from 1 to 99 it's a single
score that you can see as your credit
score for your online reputation or you
know a single score that you can measure
influence with call score is calculated
by incorporating all your data from
various social networks ranging from
Twitter to Facebook to LinkedIn and for
each network overclocked about a hundred
signals number of retweets you get per
tweet
number of likes you get proposed on
Facebook stuff like that or all the
signals that we look at overall we
consider four hundred signals per person
and we generate scores for 400 million
more users every day Klout score follows
the spy model distribution where you
have this very big peak of users who are
in this 42 60s on this side and those
are the users who are quality content
producers and you also have this very
nice peak of users on the other side who
are the consumers of those content and
if you you know plot the score and the
number of users within each school
bucket from this side to this side you
know this is zero and that's 99 and this
you know the y axis is the number of
users who are in this bucket you can see
a very nice bimodal distribution there
the average class score is lower than
the medium because there are
proportionally more people with a lower
score so they drag the average down so
in such a distribution taking a look at
the medium makes more sense being able
to beat 40 is actually a pretty good
sign of being very
fellatio on the social media</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
