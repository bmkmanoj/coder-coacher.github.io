class the best thing that you could do
is start drawing the diagram so what I
want you to do is draw the diagram of
you both your revenue streams and your
pricing and I want you to actually put
numbers in them so let's assume this is
your company over here and what you've
discovered is that there are three
different customer segments look at that
tenants and property owners and leasing
companies I want to know is this a
subscription what is the revenue stream
that you have between each one of these
customer segments and what are the
pricing tactics and then how do you make
money and what do you provide and all of
a sudden you could now see both the
revenue stream and the pricing going
back and forth I just really believe if
you could draw it you have a handle on
understanding it and don't worry on day
one is if it you start drawing it and
realize well I really don't understand
this stuff that's just a signal time to
get out of the building again talk to
some more people and say well how are we
gonna make money here because I can't
even explain it to myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
