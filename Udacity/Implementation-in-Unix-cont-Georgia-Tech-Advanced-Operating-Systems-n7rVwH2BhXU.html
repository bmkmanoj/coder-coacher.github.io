virtual memory part as well as the UBC
part of the original system to handle
the needs of the global memory system in
particular what you notice is that the
VM and the unified buffer cache when it
wanted a missing page it used to go to
the disk but here what we're going to do
is we're gonna make it go to the GMs
because GMS knows whether a particular
page that is missing in the address
space of a process is present in some
remote GMS and similarly if a page is
missing from the file cache it knows
whether that page is perhaps in the
remote GMS so that's why what we do is
we modify the virtual memory manager and
the unified buffer cache manager to get
their calls forgetting and putting pages
get page is when there is a page fault I
need to get that page I would go to the
disk normally but and now I go to GMS
like GMS worry about getting it for me
similarly if a page is missing in the
unified buffer cache I go to the GMS to
say get me that page for me and he will
then do the work of finding out whether
it is in remote GMS or if it is not
anywhere in the cluster as we've seen in
some of the cases it could be under
their schedule get it from the disk
notice also writes to disk is unchanged
originally whenever the VM manager
decides to write to the disk it's
because a page is dirty it writes to the
disk that part we don't want to mess
with because we are not affecting the
reliability of the system in any way
rights remain unchanged only when you
have a page fault you have to get it get
the page from the disk you don't go to
the disk anymore but you come to GMS and
GMS then is integrated into this system
so that it figures out where to get that
missing page from remember the most
important thing that we have to do in
implementing this global LRU or
approximation to global LRU is
collecting edge information that's
pretty
tricky in the case of file cache is
pretty straightforward because it is
explicit from the process when it is
making read and write calls we can
insert code as part of integrating GMS
into this unified buffer cache to see
what pages are being accessed based on
the reads and writes that are happening
to the unified buffer cache because
these calls are explicit from the
application going into the operating
system and therefore we can intercept
those calls as part of integrating GMS
to collect age information for the pages
that are housed in the unified buffer
cache vm on the other hand is very very
complicated because memory access that a
process does is happening in hardware on
the cpu the operating system does not
see the individual memory access that a
user program is making so how does GMS
collect age information for the
anonymous that's why these pages are
called anonymous pages in this case the
pages are not anonymous because we know
exactly what pages are being reached in
by a particular read or write by a file
system but the reads and writes that a
user process is making to its virtual
address space are the pages that are
anonymous so far as the operating system
is concerned so how does the operating
system collect the Aged information in
order to do that the authors of GMS what
they did was to have a daemon part of
the memory manager in the OSF
implementation that daemons job is to
dump information from the TLB if you
recall TLB the translation lookaside
buffer contains the recent translations
that has been done on a particular node
so the TLB contains information about
the recently accessed pages on a
particular processor periodically say
every minute it dumps the contents of
the TLB into a data structure that the
GMs maintains so that it can use that
information in the
driving the age information for all the
anonymous pages that are being handled
by the VM so that is how GMS collects
the age information at every node so
this is where I meant the technical
details are very important because this
idea of how to gather age information is
something that might be useful if you're
implementing a completely different
facility and similarly when it comes to
the page or daemon the page or daemon
normally what it would do is when it is
throwing out pages if they are dirty
pages it'll write it out to the disk and
if it has clean pages it can simply
discard it
but now when it has a clean page it
wants to discard a clean page the page
or demon will give it to GMS because GMS
will say well don't throw it out i will
put it into cluster memory so that it is
available later on for retrieval rather
than going to the disk so this is how
GMS is integrated into this whole
picture interacting with the unified
buffer cache interacting with the VM
manager interacting with the page or
daemon and the free list maintenance as
well in terms of allocating and freeing
frames on every node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
