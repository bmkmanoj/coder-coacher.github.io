the template of most of the fill-in
function and I want you to just put in
two missing pieces so what is it the
fill-in function do well first it finds
all the letters in the formula and I
want you to fill in that piece and then
it iterates a collection called the
digits a permutation of the digits taken
from all the digits the and at a time
and you have to fill in the right value
of n and then it builds a table from
taking the letters and so that means you
want to make sure that the letters up
here are represented as a string and not
as some other type of collection makes a
translation table from the letters and a
string of all the digits that we got out
of the permutations the function
itertools that permutations returns a
tuple of results and so we want to join
together that tuple into one big string
make up the translation table and then
call formula with the translate method
with that table to translate all the
letters into the appropriate digits and
yield that result so in other words fill
in is a generator function not a
function that returns a list of results
why do they do it that way well because
you might get lucky it might be that the
very first formula you try are one of
the few first formulas you try is a
correct one and so if I do for F and
fill in a formula I asked for the first
formula and if it is valid then I want
to return it right away I don't want to
waste time calculating all the other
possible fill ins so that's why a
generator makes more sense here so see
if you can fill in these two missing
pieces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
