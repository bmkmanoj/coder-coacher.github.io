models of computers the models that
ignore the memory hierarchy parallel ISM
and communication have nevertheless been
extremely productive in other words the
cs community has produced an amazing
array of applications without having to
think too hard about the physical
realities of machines or so it seems but
if we are in fact approaching the end of
Moore's law and as we hit new
performance bottlenecks like the limits
on power and energy then I think you
have to stop and ask yourself the kind
of basic questions that Danny Hillis was
asking in the early 80s these are
questions like how do we make the most
of the machines we have is there a role
for physical reality and the design of
algorithms and software and how exactly
would we do all that and still be
productive developers these and related
questions are at the frontier of hpc
research they include wackier ideas like
quantum computing and biological
computing these are among the main
extremes of physical computation now
while our course won't go so far as to
talk about these wackier ideas lucky for
you there's plenty of time afterwards
for you to think about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
