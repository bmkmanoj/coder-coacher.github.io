dynamic programming that we haven't
touched on but the three we covered
provide a good sample and help
illustrate the general strategy perhaps
the most important lesson is that any
time you found a recursive solution to a
problem think carefully about what the
subproblems are and whether there's an
overlap that you can exploit note that
this won't always work dynamic program
will not yield a polynomial algorithm
for every problem with a recursive
formulation take satisfiability for
example pick a variable and set it to
true and eliminate the variable from the
rest of the formula we're left with
another boolean formula and if it's
satisfiable then so is the original the
same is true if we set the variable to
false and the original formula will have
a satisfying assignment if either these
other formulas do this is a perfectly
legitimate recursive formulation yet
there isn't enough overlap between the
subproblems to create a polynomial
algorithm at least not unless P is equal
to NP in the next lesson we'll examine
the fast Fourier transform this is much
more divide and conquer problem than it
is a dynamic programming one though many
of the same themes of identifying
subproblems and reusing calculation will
appear as we study it keep this in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
