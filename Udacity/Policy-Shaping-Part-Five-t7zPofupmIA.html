this like if we have a C that is a
specific which is to say the probability
that I get it right if it's one kind of
thing versus the probably I get it right
if it's some other kind of thing
we can probably generalize that C to
having a different C for each of the
actions yeah we could I don't want to
but we could actually the the more look
I think the more likely case in some
sense is a weird one that seems
counterintuitive which is not for every
action do I have a different C but
what's the probability that I would say
something is right versus the
probability I would say something is
wrong those don't have to be the same
probability this C actually represents
the probability that the label I give
you is correct but there are actually
more possibilities there can be there's
a difference between a false positive
and false negative got it so we're
treating that as if there's only two
cases here but there's actually four
okay that's very but nobody wants the
last thing I'll say about this before I
move on to my last slide is notice that
I've acted as if there's only two cases
here there's the case where any policy
could be optimal and then there's the
case where only one can be optimal but
there's actually spaces in between here
so you could imagine a case where you
might say well there can be more than
one optimal policy but it's more likely
there's only one it's slightly less
likely that there are two it's slightly
less likely that there are three and so
on and so forth and you could have a
prior over any of the combinations of
actions being optimal and that prior
need not be uniform and in fact even
here we're actually assuming a
distribution over all the possible two
to the N minus one policies in such a
way that each action independently is
equally likely you could set things up
so that yeah sure it may be the case
that there's more than one optimal
policy but a alone is much more likely
than a and B which is even more likely
than a B and C and so on and so forth
does that make things much hairier in
terms of the formulas much hairy I mean
the reason we end up with something
that's this simple over here and this
simple in the general case and this
simple and the only one case is that we
get to eliminate all the common priors I
see and if we can if we can't eliminate
it we got to carry them around with us
yeah okay cool okay that's good that's
cool
now does this tell us what to do also if
we have a if we have a prior that some
action is
because you know let's say we've been
learning for a while like yeah that
really seems like the right thing to do
and then the human is telling us
something else can we factor in the
information that we've gotten from our
own experience that is exactly what I
was gonna bring up next so why don't I
do that awesome awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
