for any message ciphertext pair there's
one key that map's that message to that
ciphertext we can see that thinking
about the nature of the one-time pad
suppose we just have one bit messages we
have messages 0 &amp;amp; 1 well then the key 0
will map 0 to 0 the key 1 will map 1 to
0 and the keys 0 will map 1 to 1 but
this works for any length message in any
length key note that the length of the
key and the length of a message scale
the same way so if we had 2 bit messages
there will be 4 different keys that
would map each message to each different
ciphertext if we had 2 bit messages
there would also be one key that map's
each message to each different
ciphertext for example the key that
map's 0 1 2 1 0 would be the key 1 1 so
that means we can compute this
probability summing over all the
messages summing over all the keys where
we've got the probability that that key
encrypts that message to the given
ciphertext and we need to divide this by
the space which is the size of the
messages times the size of the keys so
now what's the value of the summation so
we know for a given message there's
exactly one key that map's it that
ciphertext so this is 1 and we're
summing over all the messages summing
the value of 1 so that means we're going
to get the number of messages divided by
number of messages times the number of
keys so that's equal to 1 over the
number of keys so that's the probability
of event B which is the probability that
some message encrypts to some key and
noticed this is far computed over all
the messages so that's over the
distribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
