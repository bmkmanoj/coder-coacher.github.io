clearly not equal to alpha this is a
huge angle greater than 90 degrees but I
do know that this angle is identical to
alpha the reason I know that well
they're opposite each other so that's
always going to be the case that
opposite angles are identical but let's
talk about why well if I examine this
entire arc here I know a straight line
well that's I've made half of a circle
here so this is 180 degrees this angle
here is some alpha degrees I don't know
what that is which means that this angle
marked in red must be 180 minus alpha
all right so now since this line here is
also equal to 180 degrees this segment
of it is 180 minus alpha this segment
must also be equal to alpha but that's
not so interesting what I care more
about is this angle here which also
happens to be equal to alpha and again
we can talk about why let's extend this
line and this line a little bit and then
we have these two parallel lines the
black line here is parallel with this
purple line up here we can go through
the same sort of thinking to prove that
this angle is alpha this one here is 180
minus alpha this one has to be alpha and
then this one over here would be 180
minus alpha but this is what we care
about this angle here is identical to
this angle here now we're making some
real progress let me clean this up a bit
so we can see what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
