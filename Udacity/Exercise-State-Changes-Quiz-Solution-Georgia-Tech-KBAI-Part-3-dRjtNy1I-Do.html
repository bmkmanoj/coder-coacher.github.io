for the first one I did what we talked
about earlier I to start at the left
Anika is an agent so we're just going to
store that away for the while and the
first verb we encounter is decided
earlier we said the decided corresponds
to the conclude primitive action so our
primitive here is going to kabhi
conclude the animate agent immediately
preceding conclude is Anika so our agent
is Anika the result of this decision is
a new action our primitive here is now
in jest our agent is Anika because we're
going to infer that nikka is the one
having the glass of water because she's
the one who decided to have the glass of
water and the object that is being had
is the glass of water so the first
action Anika concluding caused the
second action Anika ingesting a glass of
water so for the second sentence mark
loved watching TED Talks the action that
mark is really completing here is this
watching action so our primitive here is
see mark is the one seeing TED talks
that we discern by the same reasoning as
earlier the verb loved here tells us
something about the change in mark's
mood when he watches TED talks so that
means that the result of this action of
watching TED talks is it marks mood gets
happier that's good David note though
that distant is a little bit like a
shook enjoyed eating the Frog this is
one representation for the sentence on
another representation we may have to
action frames one corresponding the
world loved another correspond to the
word watching and then connect them to
this slot result I hope you can see how
air agents might be able to understand
simple stories in fact this is quite
similar to the way Watson and City go
about understanding the stories that we
talked to them almost sure that the
human interactions with the machines of
tomorrow will not be based on the
keyboards and mouses that we have today
we'll talk to the machines the machines
were talked back to us and when we talk
to the machines will be telling machine
stories stories like Anika I decided to
have a glass of water or a shock enjoyed
eating the Frog and when we tell these
stories the stories will have context
they will have ambiguities and we would
expect the machines to do common sense
reasoning the power of this particular
lesson lies in the beginning of a
representation that enables a particular
kind of comments
33 we'll continue this discussion about
common sense reasoning of more complex
stories in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
