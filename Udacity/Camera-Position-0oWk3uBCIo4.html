map fragment provides a view over the
map based on the specifications defined
on your camera if you don't define a
camera you just get a view of the entire
world of a latitude zero and longitude
zero understanding the camera is a key
to understanding your app the camera is
controlled using a class called camera
position the properties that define your
camera are the targets and this is the
latitude and longitude that you want to
point the camera at this lat/long will
define the center of your map and how
much of the map you see is determined by
the zoom this is a value from zero the
farthest out effectively showing the
whole world down to 21 which is really
close to street level you can get in
even closer by using Street View and
you'll see that in a later lesson
bearing is a property and this
determines the direction that the camera
is facing it's specified in degrees
clockwise from north so if you want the
camera to be facing east the bearing
would be 90 degrees if you wanted to
face north west the bearing would be 315
degrees tilt is how much the camera is
tilted by by default this is zero which
means the camera is facing directly down
towards the ground you can increase this
with the upper bound determined by how
far zoomed out you are so for example if
you're zoomed out really far the maximum
tilt that you can do is thirty degrees
as you get closer to the earth the
maximum tilt goes up with a maximum of
sixty seven and a half degrees you can
just see tilts as how the camera is
tilted towards the ground you're looking
straight down at the ground or you're
tilted aim at the ground so you can get
a 3d isometric style view like you had
with the skyscrapers earlier on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
