public-key algorithms RSA and
diffie-hellman let's go over the
background first both RSA and
diffie-hellman are based on number
theory an ancient and yet active field
in mathematics these public-key
algorithms use modular arithmetic
including modular addition modular
multiplication and modular
exponentiation and they make use of
results from number theory let's briefly
introduce the background of modular
arithmetic first let's explain modular
addition given a modular M X plus y mod
M is the remainder of X plus y divided
by M for example 2 plus 8/10 the
remainder is 0 so therefore 2 plus 8 mod
10 is 0 well as 3 plus 8 mar 10 is one
because 3 plus 8 is 11 and 11 / 10 the
remainder is 1 therefore 3 plus 8 mod 10
is one amar jeweler addition if we add a
number and it's inverse then the result
is 0 for example if the modulus is 10
then for k equal to 2 is inverse is 8
because 2 plus 8 mar 10 is 0 having
additive inverse means that modular
addition is reversible that is by adding
the inverse we can reverse the result of
modular addition this is very convenient
for encryption and decryption because as
we have discussed we want the encryption
process to believe versatile meaning
that ideally the decryption process is
just the reverse of the encryption
process for example given plain text p
equal to 3 suppose the key K is to and
the way we include the plaintext p is to
add the key under module addition to
paint XP and the result is safe attack
so c equal to p plus k which is 3 plus 2
mar 10 the result is 5 that is the
ciphertext C of paint XP equal to 3 is 5
now how do we decrypt to decrypt we use
the same process but instead of using
the key we use the keys in verse we know
that the inverse of two is eight so
therefore c plus K inverse is 5 plus 8
mod 10 that is 13 mar 10 the result is 3
which is exactly the plaintext and so
this is how we can do decryption by
using the exact same process as the
encryption and instead of using the key
we use is inverse in the cushion and we
take advantage the fact that under
module addition each number has a
inverse therefore each Key has an
inverse and we just use the inverse of
the key in the crip shin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
