let me show why at the minimum both
contributions are equal I'd explain why
that is so in a second so we find that
the constant C times the value H minimum
equals the constant D times epsilon over
H minimum from which follows that H
minimum is the square root of D epsilon
over C epsilon is multiplied by a factor
of 10 to the minus 9 which means that
the value of H min for double precision
is multiplied by a factor of square root
of 10 to the minus nine starting from
the value of H min for singer position
we have 2 x square root of 10 to the
minus nine in total this is 10 to the
minus 8.5 and that's about 3 times 10 to
the minus 9 an important remark this
model was made for the forward Euler
method if you have a method of higher
order if we have CH square or even ch4
in here so from this result we learn
that as we go from single to double
precision we may be using a step size
that's about four to five orders of
magnitude smaller and hence the error
will be smaller by four to five orders
of magnitude the price that we would be
paying is that we have in the order of
10 to the 4 to 10 to the five more
computation which looks a little
prohibitive but then again with a method
of higher order you need far fewer steps
than with the forward Euler method so
the effect of round off errors tend to
be very smaller with more advanced
methods in case you're interested let me
explain while these two contributions
are equal at the minimum otherwise skip
over the rest of this video substitute
the step size H by e to the minus you
with an appropriate value of you then
the total error becomes C times e to the
minus u Plus D epsilon e to the U
because we are dividing by that power
now you can see that the first part
becomes a falling exponential function
and the second one becomes an increasing
exponential function both
fall and due to symmetry the minimum has
be where these two curves meet a
completely different approach to that
problem is of course to compute the
derivative and set it equal to zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
