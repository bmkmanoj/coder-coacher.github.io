each other it kind of raises the
question why don't we just use a
gradient descent type approach on an
error metric that's defined in terms of
y hat instead of does the activation a
because Y hat is the thing that we
really want to match the output we don't
really want the activation to match the
output this node there's no need for
that so it seems like there's a bunch of
different possible reasons for that it
could be well we don't do that because
it would just be computationally
intractable it's too it's too much work
another possibility would be well to do
the gradient descent you have to be able
to take the derivative and if we use it
in this form it's not differentiable so
we can't take the derivative another one
is well sure we can do all that it's
it's not intractable and it's not non
differentiable it's differentiable but
if we do that then the weights tend to
grow too fast and so you end up getting
unstable answers and then the last
possible choice that will give you is
you can do that but you can get multiple
different answers and the different
answers behave differently and so this
is really just to keep it from being
ill-defined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
