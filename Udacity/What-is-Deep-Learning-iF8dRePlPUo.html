name is Vincent and I'm a research
scientist at Google working on machine
learning and artificial intelligence
deep learning is an exciting branch of
machine learning that uses data lots of
data to teach computers how to do things
only humans were capable of before
myself I'm very interested in solving
the problem of perception recognizing
what's in an image what people are
saying when they're talking on their
phone helping robots explore the world
and interact with it deep learning has
emerged as a central tool to solve
perception problems in recent years it's
the state of the art on everything
having to do with computer vision and
speech recognition but there's more
increasingly people are finding that
deep learning is a much better tool to
solve problems like discovering new
medicines understanding natural language
understanding documents and for example
ranking them for search so let's take a
look at what you'll be doing during this
