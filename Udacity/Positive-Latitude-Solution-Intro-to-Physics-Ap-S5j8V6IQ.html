coming in parallel to strike the earth
this would be the equator and this line
up here would be the Tropic of Cancer
where the sun's rays are striking the
earth perpendicularly if I have some one
meter long rod let's say here at some
latitude north of the Tropic of Cancer I
can sort of see that there would be a
shadow down here cast by the rod in fact
I'm undressing lines to help guide our
eyes I know that this angle here is 23.5
degrees because this is where the sun's
rays are striking vertically this angle
i'm going to call alpha and i can tell
since this line is parallel to this line
this angle is alpha as well okay well
clearly my latitude I'll call that L
it's just equal to twenty three point
five plus whatever this angle alpha is
so I just need to find alpha so let's
zoom in here because this is where alpha
is showing up to see if we can figure
out what's going on well here's our
object with a height of 1 meter and here
come the sun's rays which makes this the
shadow down here and the shadow also has
a length of 1 meter I can see that this
angle alpha is this angle formed by the
sun's rays and the object and so the
tangent of alpha is just equal to this
opposite side over the adjacent side or
1 over 1 which is just equal to one if I
use a calculator to find the inverse
tangent of one I find that alpha is
equal to 45 degrees since my latitude is
just 45 plus 23.5 well I have a latitude
68.5 degrees north</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
