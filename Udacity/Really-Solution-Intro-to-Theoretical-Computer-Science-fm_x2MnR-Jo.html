and this comes from the definition of
np-completeness by definition since sat
is in NP complete every problem in NP
can be reduced to it in polynomial time
so there can't exist NP complete
problems they can't be transformed into
sat in polynomial time the second
problem is also false non-deterministic
Rams don't give different results for
the same decision problem this is
something a lot of people have problems
with but the key is that non determinism
isn't the same thing as randomness at
each step remember whenever the
if-better procedure is called it makes
the best possible decision so it's not
going to make a random one and it's
going to make the same best possible
decision every time so it won't give
different results for the same decision
problem the third problem is also false
a problem with exponential possible
solutions can only be in P if P equals
NP a good problem to see this on is
sorting whenever you sort a list of n
elements let's say there are
exponentially many different possible
sorts but actually there are quite a few
sorting algorithms that can find the
correct sort of a an element list in
much shorter than exponential time so
this is actually not true the fourth
problem just like the other three is
also false it is not true that every
program that takes exponential time on a
deterministic machine can be made to run
in polynomial time on a
non-deterministic machine and good
examples of this are any program where
the output size is exponential in the
input size for example if you have a
list of n elements and then you want to
print out all possible sub lists then
the fact that you have to print out
every single possible sub list of which
there are exponentially many in the
input size of the list means that if
better doesn't actually buy you anything
you still have to explore the entire
exponential space so even a
non-deterministic machine will have to
take exponential time in that case
