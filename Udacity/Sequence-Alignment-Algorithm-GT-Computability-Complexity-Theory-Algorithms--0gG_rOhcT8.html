recursive implementation would involve
an unfortunate amount of recomputation
so we'll look for a better solution
notice that its natural to organize our
subproblems in a grid like this one
knowing c33 the cost of a line in the
full sequence depends on knowing C 3 2 C
2 2 and C 2 3 knowing C 2 3 depends on
knowing C 2 2 c1 2 and C 1 3 and indeed
in general to figure out any cost we
need to note the costs to the west to
the northwest and to the north to fill
out this grid these dependencies form a
directed acyclic graph and we can
linearize them in any number of ways we
might do it in scanline order like this
or in left-to-right fashion like this or
even maybe along the diagonals like this
we'll keep it simple and go in scanline
order first we need to fill out the base
cases this first row in this first
column and then it's just a matter of
passing over the grid and taking the
minimum of the three possibilities
outlined earlier once we've finished we
can retrace our steps by looking at the
west north and northwest neighbors to
figure out what step we took and this
then will allow us to reconstruct the
alignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
