mistakes let's go back to an earlier
example we encounter this example when
we were discussing explanation based
learning so imagine again that you have
bought a robot from the Acme hardware
store and in the morning you tell the
robot go get me a cup of coffee now the
robot already's boost rapid knowledge
about the definition of the cup a cup is
an object that is stable and enables
drinking the robot goes into your
kitchen and can't find a single clean
cup so it looks around this is a
creative robot and it finds in the
kitchen a number of other objects one
particular object has this description
the object is light and is made of
porcelain it has decorations and it has
concavity and a handle at the bottom of
this object is flat now the robot
decides to use this object as a cup
because it can prove to itself that this
object is an instance of a cup it does
so by constructing an explanation the
explanation is based on the fact that
the bottom is flat that it is a handle
that you object is concave and get it is
light let us do an exercise together
that will illustrate the need for
learning by correcting mistakes so shown
here are six objects and their two
questions here the first question is
which of these objects do you think is
the cup mark the butt on the top left if
you think that a particular object is a
cup the second question deals with the
definition of a cup that we had on the
previous screen so mark the button on
the right as solid if you think that
that particular object meets the
definition of the cup in the previous
screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
