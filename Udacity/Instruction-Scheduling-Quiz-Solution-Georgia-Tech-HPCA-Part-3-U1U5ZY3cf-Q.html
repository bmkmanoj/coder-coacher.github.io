quiz solution as is this takes one cycle
to do the load if the load latency was
one cycle then the ad could have
happened the next cycle but because the
load takes two cycles the ad can only
happen in cycle three so we have one
cycle three the ad takes only one cycle
so the store can proceed then we can do
the load it doesn't depend on anything
so we can do the load in X cycle five
the ad however can now happen only in
cycle seven and finally the store
happens in cycle eight so as is this
executes in eight cycles the question is
now can we scheduled is better to avoid
some of these stalls and we had a stall
here and here
to avoid a stall here we need to place
between the load and the add an
instruction that can be done here
without violating dependencies we can
see that this load here doesn't depend
on any of the previous three
instructions except that we will destroy
r1 if we move that instruction here so
the correct solution to this is we will
move the load there but we will rename
our r1 into something else so the
program becomes now load word r10 of r2
as before now we move the other load
there put the result in sum on our 10
let's say now we can do this ad because
in the third cycle we can do it now that
we have done this ad we can actually do
this so the load has already happened we
are now in the second cycle since then
so the second ad can happen the ad was
using r1 now we have to use our 10 next
we will do our store and the last
remaining store as you can see now we
have a processor where whenever we need
two cycles for the load there is
something in between the load and the
use of its result here r1 is loaded we
then don't use r1 and then we add to it
and here our 10 is loaded and then we
don't do anything with our 10 and then
we add to it so this can be done in 6
cycles eliminating both of the stall
cycles that we previously had</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
