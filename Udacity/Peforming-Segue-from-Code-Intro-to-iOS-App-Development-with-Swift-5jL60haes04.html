called recorded audio with two fields
file path URL and title the next thing I
will do is go back to record sounds view
controller and then scroll to this audio
recorder did finish recording function
the first thing I have to do here is I
have to save the recorded audio and I
will do that with the most recent class
I have created so what I will do is
scroll up to the very top and then
create a new object for this class which
is a recorded audio there and then I'll
scroll back to my function and in here I
will initialize the new object there now
I can set the attributes of this object
one of them is file path URL the value
for this can be obtained using the
recorder parameter this is the reference
to the audio file that was actually
recorded on the phone so I can say
something like recorder dot URL then I
will set the title of this object
recorded audio I can get this value from
the recorder parameter also I can say
recorder dot URL dot last path component
this gives us the name of the recorded
file all right with that step one is
done step two is to perform a segue to
the next scene I can accomplish that by
calling the perform segue with
identifier function you should note that
we inherit this method from
uiviewcontroller now Xcode is asking me
for an identifier of the segue and I
recall that the ID of my segue was stop
recording there just as a quick recap
however let me go back to my storyboard
and then select this segue and slide the
utility tray out to see that the
identifier for this segue was in fact
stopped recording okay let me go back to
my code now for this second parameter
sender we will pass in the new object
recorded audio let me do that this is
the object that actually initiates the
segue alright so it seems like step two
is also done by the way at this point I
want to highlight that the name of our
function is called audio recorder did
finish recording successfully and the
way we can figure out if the record
was in fact accomplished successfully is
by using this boolean flag so I will add
an if statement here and then close all
of this code within that if statement if
for some reason the audio recording does
not finish successfully then what I can
do is print out an error message and
update the correct settings on my
buttons all right let's run our project
okay let me record something is this
going to work okay so it seems that the
segue is happening and this time it's
happening through code and now let me
play the sound my mom always said life
was like a box of chocolates hmm the app
is still playing the movie quote why do
you think our app is still playing the
quote and not the recorded voice enter
your thoughts in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
