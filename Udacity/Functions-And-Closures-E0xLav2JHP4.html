a rich playground for future reference
check it out but we'll go through all
the code right here so far it looks like
a closure is a function with some extra
features and a slightly different syntax
not so little grasshopper functions and
closures are exactly the same thing they
just have a different syntax there for
all the extras that closures pack are
also available two functions closures
and functions are just like our alter
egos for the same thing like Peter
Parker and spider-man so the function
enclosure that i'm going to show you
right now are exactly equivalent they
don't just do the same thing check them
out they are the same thing so we have
first a function that takes an integer
and returns an integer and it adds 42 to
it and then we have a closure that does
exactly the same thing they look at
given but actually there are more than
just equivalent they are exactly the
same thing actually when the compiler
finds a function declaration such as foo
over here it will take the following
steps first of all create a closure that
takes an integer and returns 42 plus
that integer and then assign that
closure to a constant called foo sounds
familiar yep that's exactly what you've
done here for bar so the bottom line is
since functions and closures are the
same thing you should use whatever
syntax makes more sense at a given time
it's up to you to choose which one you
prefer at any given point so if closures
and functions are exactly the same thing
we should be able to add functions to a
collection such as an array as we did
with the closures in the previous
playground silently so let's give it a
try I'm going to show you a few
functions and then we'll add them to an
array and iterate through the array and
call the functions just that we did
before so here we have three functions
that take an integer and return an
integer just like those that we've seen
before and now we're going to add them
to an array and see if it works
and it certainly does work here we have
the three functions within the array so
could we add the bar closure over here
to this array think about it yes they
have the same type and it doesn't matter
if they were defined using the closure
syntax or the function one let's add it
and now we can just call all those
functions and closures that are inside
to suit so for and again it works
exactly as expected and we can display
it also as a line graph so now I have a
question for you could we add the
function bass that is here to this array
think about it or try it if you must but
you shouldn't need it by now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
