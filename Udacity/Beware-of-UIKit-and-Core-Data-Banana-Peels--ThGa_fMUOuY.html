background it is said to be thread-safe
however there are several frameworks
that are not thread-safe and can only
run in the main queue there are two
notable cases in the Apple stack these
are two banana peels waiting for a
newbie to step on them these are you I
kit and core data let's start with UI
kit you cannot run anything from you a
kid in the background or your app will
crash intermittently that's the beauty
of concurrency bugs sometimes they show
up sometimes they don't the bottom line
is never use anything whose name ends
with view in the background or else core
data is a bit more complicated and we
will deal with this in greater detail
once we reach core data the thing to
remember here is that ns-managed object
context can only be used in the same
queue it was created therefore if you
created the context in the main queue
you may only use it in the main queue
however if you create a context in a
background queue then you may only use
it in the background my recommendation
is to wait until we feel really
confident with core data and GCD before
you try to mix them together core data
in the background is second and core
data so tread carefully daniel-san until
then wax on wax off remember to breathe
