clicked here it seems like I can access
a bunch of my objects yep
clicked here and this was interesting so
what's going on with these guys yeah so
remember earlier when we overrode the
global action layout to be able to put
in our create a set time action yeah
this is the global layout that you'll
see from anywhere inside this mobile app
if you haven't overrode the global layup
okay so you can create a chatter pose
create a new contact maybe create a task
all of these things are actions that are
quickly available to mobile users to do
from anywhere in the app okay so
presumably that means the the action I
made the make a new set time yep I can
do that from my phone
yeah super easy so how would I do that
okay so close the global actions and if
you scroll down you can see we can click
straight into that Udacity stage record
like we saw earlier but instead of going
that direction let's just use the mobile
navigation by clicking that little icon
in the corner yep and then scroll up to
the show more click that guy and just go
to the stage tab and we'll go straight
to the record this way okay Udacity
stage yep now plus has at a set time
yeah pretty cool okay so if I hit at a
set time as I expect has all these
fields let's say it's just December
first sounds good mm-hmm status is new
oh cool it has that automatic thing yep
nice time I really like how it automates
the pick list it just knows except
Udacity stage and let's pick a band
let's go with you three again all right
so what we're looking at right now is
the Udacity stage you know mobile page
layout it shows us all the fields that
we saw in the computer right but we can
scroll left and right and see different
things on this so in this case on this
first window we can see the chatter feed
and so this is the set time we just
created and here's the set time we've
created in Yap earlier now if we scroll
to the right we can see the related
lists of all the things related to this
Audacity stage so like the set times we
just created makes sense cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
