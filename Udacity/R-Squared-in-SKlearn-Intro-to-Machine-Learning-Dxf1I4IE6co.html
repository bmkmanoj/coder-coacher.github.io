you question you might be asking is this
is all well and good Katie but how do I
get this information you've been given
me an equation for it or anything like
that and what I want to do instead of
giving you a big mathematical equation
which I don't find that interesting and
you could look up on your own I want to
show you how to get this information out
of scikit-learn this is the code we were
looking at a few videos ago when we were
building our net worth predictor now I
filled in these lines that are importing
the linear regression and making some
predictions another thing that happened
was I printed some information to the
screen you may remember two of these
things I explained to you already the
slope and the intercept I access that
information by looking for the
coefficients and the intercept of the
regression these are just lines of code
that I found in an example online but
one thing that I promised we would come
back to and now we are is this r-squared
score that I was printing out and the
way I access that is through the
regression score quantity this is kind
of similar to how we computed the
accuracy in our supervised classifier so
what we do is we pass the ages which are
the features in this case the inputs and
the net worths
which are the outputs the things we're
trying to predict and then since the
regression has already been fit up here
it knows what it thinks the relationship
between these two quantities are so this
is all the information that it needs to
compute an r-squared score and then I
can just print it out so let me take you
over here and show you again what that
looks like I have the same output as I
had before this might look a little bit
familiar so I'm predicting my own net
worth I have my slope by intercepts but
now you understand the importance of the
r-squared score so my r-squared score is
about 0.8 six which is actually really
good I'm predicting I'm doing about 85%
of what the best I could be doing is I
would say 86% is pretty close to one it
can be a little bit of an art to
translate between an r-squared
numerically and saying whether it's a
good fit or not and this is something
you'll get some intuition for over time
as you play with things I would
certainly say that 0.857 is a good
r-squared we're doing a good job of
capturing the relationship between the
age and the net worth of people here
I've also seen high
our squares in my life so it's possible
that there still could be variables out
there for example features that if we
were able to incorporate the information
from additional features we would be
better able to predict a person's net
worth so in other words if we were able
to use more than one feature sometimes
we can push up this r-squared even
further on the other hand there
sometimes really complicated problems
where it's almost impossible to get an R
squared that would be anywhere near this
high so sometimes in political science
for example they're trying to run a
regression that will predict whether a
country will go to war</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
