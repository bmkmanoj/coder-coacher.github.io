building a physical prototype you need
to have a low fidelity app or website
available for customer feedback what is
a low fidelity mean well that's just
kind of my description of you don't need
an entire finished web site but you
should at least have a wireframe and if
you don't have a wireframe you should at
least have a PowerPoint of mock-ups or a
flash demo or something so people could
see not only what you're describing in
words but actually could say oh I get it
now remember don't demo that first your
goal here is to first understand the
problem and I make people sometimes that
would like to give demos leave all that
stuff home when you're first having the
problem discussion but the minute you
get into the well with something like
this solve your problem for a web mobile
app you really want to get feedback on a
low fidelity app as quickly as possible
and when we teach this as a class
literally by the second week of the
class if you're building a web and
mobile app you have to have your site or
wireframe up and running so people can
actually see it and give you feedback
later on you're gonna build what I call
the high fidelity app and that tests
your understanding of the solution this
actually has most of the features might
not have health files the graphics might
not be complete but a high fidelity app
that gives you more resolution on well
we really didn't like that color we you
know that button was in the wrong place
etc this helps you avoid building
products no one wants and it maximizes
the learning per time spent on the
product and on customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
