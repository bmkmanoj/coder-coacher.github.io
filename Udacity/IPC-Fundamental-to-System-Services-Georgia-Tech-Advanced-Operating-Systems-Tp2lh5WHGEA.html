operating system IPC both within and on
the local area network is a crucial
component of Quicksilver and this
picture shows the semantics of the IPC
call in the colonel there is a data
structure called service queue which is
created by the server that wants to
service requests from clients and
clients make a request and the colonel
does an up call to the server to
indicate this as a client request the
server execute the up call associated
with this particular request when it
completes the request the completion
goes back into the service queue and
that is an indication for the kernel to
give the response back to the client so
there is a synchronous client call where
the client is waiting till the request
is actually serviced and the completion
response comes back to the client and
the service queue is a global service
queue just like UNIX socket so any
process anywhere in the network which
has knowledge about the service queue
can connect to it and make requests on
the service queue and similarly any
server process in the entire distributed
system can service requests that are
coming into the service queue and there
are some fundamental guarantees provided
by Quicksilver for inter process
communication which includes no laws or
duplication of requests so if a request
comes in it'll get done exactly once and
it also ensures that there is no
duplication it also ensures there is no
loss of the request and Quicksilver also
takes care of reliability of the data
transfer that is inherent when the
client and the server are on remote
machines and because the service queue
data structure is globally unique for
every such service there is location
transparency for client-server
interactions or in other words a client
does not need to know where in the
network its particular request is being
serviced so that is yet another feature
of the IPC guarantee or the
PC call can also be asynchronous what
that means is the client can make a
request asynchronously and continue with
its own execution whatever it wants to
do it doesn't have a block on this the
colonel is going to take the same action
and that is if there is a server that is
available then the kernel is going to
pass it to that server to execute that
request and when the completion comes
back in it is buffered in the service
queue by the kernel waiting for the
client to come back and ask for the
response so the client at some point has
to do a wheat on the service queue to
indicate that I'm ready to receive the
response that may have come back for the
request that I made earlier and when the
client does the wait if the original
request has already been serviced by the
server and the response is sitting in
the service queue then the colonel will
deliver the response to the client if
not the client will wait until that
response comes back so this is the
asynchronous client call but in either
case as I mentioned earlier the IPC
guarantees hold that there is no loss of
the requests and there is no duplication
of the requests and you can see from the
semantics that I described just now that
quicksilver IPC is very similar to
remote procedure call in fact the remote
procedure called paradigm was invented
around the same time as the Quicksilver
operating system and since all services
are contained in server processes IPC is
fundamental to pick silver the IPC
semantics supported by Quicksilver
allows multiple servers to wait on a
service queue and the way they will do
that is by making a call called offer
which is essentially saying i'm willing
to offer my services for this particular
service queue any number of servers can
make this offer and that essentially
means that if requests come in that any
one of these servers can be called by
the kernel depending on the busyness of
the servers with respect to handling
requests that have come in for the
service queue in the past the
client-server relationship is
interchangeable for example a client can
make a call on a file system server and
the file system server in turn makes a
call
to a directory server and a call to your
data server so in this case the flying
system becomes a client to the directory
server and the data server so in that
sense the client-server relationship is
interchangeable now the only reason for
me to spend some time describing the IPC
semantics of Quicksilver is because the
recovery mechanism it's tight intimately
with the IPC and in fact that's how you
can have the cake and eat it too in
Quicksilver in other words the
client-server interactions have to use
IPC so the recovery mechanism using
transactions rides on top of the IPC
essentially bundling the recovery
mechanism with IPC to get it cheaply
another interesting footnote I want to
mention a pixel where system was first
conceived in the early 80s but the first
paper that described it appeared in 1988
and this is hardly difference between
academic research and industrial
research at least in the olden days
academic research we tend to show it off
and I'm an academic myself so I take
part of the blame but at least in the
olden days industrial research used to
take the approach of publishing a paper
especially in systems design when it is
fully cooked like I said Quicksilver was
designed and implemented in the early
80s 1984 288 but the first paper came
out in 1988 but nowadays i have to
mention that everyone is shouting often
which explains the proliferation of
conferences that you see around the
country in the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
