and BHT quiz this time the question was
how many times do we access the BTB for
each of these instructions we have a
perfect
Bhd and the perfect BTB the BTB has four
entries the BHT has 16 entries this
doesn't really matter in this part of
the quiz what you need to know is that
when you have both the BHT and the BTB
the BTB is accessed only if the BHT says
that this is a taken branch if this is
not a taken branch then we can just
increment the PC because this
instruction is not a taken branch and
because the BHT has perfect prediction
the BTB will never be accessed same
thing here and I can tell that for all
non branch instructions we will just
have zero BTB accesses because they are
never predicted to be taken branches
this branch here is executed a hundred
times and it's always taken so here the
BTB will be accessed a hundred times
this branch is more interesting in every
iteration that stays in the loop
iterations where r1 is 0 1 2 etc until
99 this branch is not-taken the BH tip
is perfectly predicting it so we don't
access the BTB at all only on the last
iteration when we are having r1 be 99
and we wrap around here and try to
compare again and this time we see that
r1 is 100 and jump out is this branch
taken because again we have a perfect
BHT that means that the only time the
BTB is accessed for this instruction is
that one last time when we are jumping
out of the loop so the BTB will be
accessed only once because there is only
one time that this branch is actually
taken</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
