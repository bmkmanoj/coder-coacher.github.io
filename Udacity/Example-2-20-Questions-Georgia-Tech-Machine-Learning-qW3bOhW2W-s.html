how to use these decision trees but this
is a class about machine learning right
so we need to figure out how to make
those decision trees happen as a result
of processing a set of training data so
it's not clear to me how we're going to
make that leap let's see if we can
figure it out together so I'm going to
play a game with you Michael and if we
do the game well then I think we'll have
an idea of what a good algorithm might
be for actually building a decision tree
so we're going to play 20 questions
you're familiar with 20 questions right
that's the game where I'm allowed to ask
yes/no questions to try to guess
something that you're thinking of and if
I take more than 20 of them then I lose
right okay so here's what I'm going to
do I'm going to think of a thing and you
ask me questions and I'm going to answer
them and we'll see if you can guess what
thing I'm thinking about okay I've got
something in my head first question the
typical first question is it animal
vegetable or mineral but that doesn't
seem like a yes/no question
so is it is it an animal or like a
living creature the answer is yes
all right is it a person is it a person
the answer is yes is it a famous person
oh is it a famous person well it's a
deep philosophical question but I'm
gonna say yes is it a famous person that
we both know in the in like directly oh
who we both personally know directly I
do not think so so the answer is no is
it a living person living person no so
it's a dead famous person is the person
famous for say being in the music
industry ah the answer is yes did this
person live during the 20th century the
answer is yes is the genre of music that
the person was associated with say
hip-hop or rap no is the person a singer
singer yes
male or female is the person female
person female no it's ten questions
Michael yes the clock is ticking down
but I feel like I have narrowed it down
quite a bit at this point did the person
die since you've become a professor so
say in the last how long have you been a
professor forever it sounds like feels
like let's see recent death and I'm
gonna say the answer is yes is the
person's name Michael oh the answer is
yes alright alright I think I'm onto it
is it Michael Jackson no woohoo
of course it's Michael Jackson alright
drill up yes Michael Jackson is the
answer alright so that was that was very
fun and I'm very safe lip to solve it
but it's not clear to me how this is
going to give us an algorithm for
building decision trees okay so let's
think about that for a second so you
asked a bunch of questions and you asked
them in a particular order right so
here's a question I have for you why was
the first question you asked me whether
it was an animal or not ah well it
seemed like I needed some way of
narrowing down the space and so I wanted
to get as much information out of that
question that as I could to try to make
progress towards figuring out who
actually was right so animal was the
first question and it was because it
narrowed things down so your goal in
asking questions was to narrow the
possibilities right sure right because I
only have 20 questions and then I'm you
know I'm out of it so if I ask questions
like you know if I started with is it
someone named Michael that would have
been really bizarre right and if the
answer was no it's not clear that it
would tell you anything at all so
actually that's an interesting point you
started with animal you could have
started with Michael and if I had said
yes that would have told you something
but if I had said no it wouldn't have
told you hardly anything at all right so
animal is a better
attribute or feature to ask about that
Michael is a first question you agree
with that yeah because it could have
been like a stapler or something like
that and then I the Michael question
would have been pretty silly exactly so
what about person so first you asked
about animal then you asked about person
why person right because because again
it seemed like of the space of
possibilities that I could think of
person would help kind of again narrow
things down that like if it was the
answer was yes I would be able to focus
there if the answer was no I could focus
on place else exactly and so I think in
fact we could we have a general
statement here that each one of these
questions person famous do we know this
person personally so on and so forth
all makes sense because they further
narrow down the possibilities and that
bit about further is important because
it implies that the usefulness of a
question depends upon the answers that
you've gotten to previous questions so
even though Michael is not a
particularly good first question and
asked it's a perfectly reasonable
twelfth question to ask or however far
down it is given that you already know
this person's this is an animal a person
a famous person we don't know personally
who's not living was into music etc etc
etc okay that makes sense yeah okay so I
think then we have the hints of an
algorithm so let's try to write down
that algorithm and and see if it matches
with our intuition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
