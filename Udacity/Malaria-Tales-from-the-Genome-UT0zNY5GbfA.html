mosquitos and involves a parasite that
grows inside red blood cells now the
parasite that causes malaria called
Plasmodium is able to easily infect
normally shaped red blood cells but the
sickle shaped cells are harder for the
parasite to infect and even when it does
infect it the cell bursts open before
the Plasmodium has finished its life
cycle having even one copy of the sickle
cell mutation or the HBS allele
increases resistance to malaria because
a few of the cells are going to be more
sickle shaped that's providing at least
a little bit of resistance to Plasmodium
infection so although the HBS allele is
recessive for sickle cell anemia it's
actually dominant with regards to
malaria resistance this means that an
individual allele a single allele could
be dominant or recessive depending on
which tray you're looking at I mean
think about it we have one allele the
HBS allele but there are two different
traits we can even think about the
sickle cell anemia trait or malaria
resistance trait in one case this allele
is recessive because you need two copies
before you really see the effect but in
the case of malaria resistance only one
copy is enough to resist Plasmodium
infection making it a dominant allele
hopefully this adds another layer of
complexity to how we've been thinking
about single individual alleles remember
one allele can have an effect on lots of
traits so in this scenario if we have no
copies of the HBS allele we're gonna be
more susceptible to Plasmodium infection
and malaria one copy makes you more
resistant to malaria but may give you
mild symptoms of anemia from some
limited sickling of cells but two copies
of the HBS allele would result in
full-circle cell anemia which typically
can reduce a person's lifespan and even
cause death during childhood so in an
area plagued by malaria like sub-saharan
Africa which genotype do you think would
have the greatest fitness or the
greatest probability of survival H
