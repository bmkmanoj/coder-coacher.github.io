at rods and cones they have a certain
similar structure they have this we'll
call it an outer part but remember the
the pigment epithelium is up here and
the light comes in that way but this is
called the outer part because it's this
inverted retina thing all right and this
inverted part is where you have these
discs shape elements that react to light
and they react to different wavelengths
of light we'll talk about the different
wavelengths in a minute and those
wavelength and those reactions set up
chemical reactions in the in the cell
and of course it is still a cell so it's
got these inner elements these
organelles and a cell nucleus and then
what's important is it has this synaptic
body where it changes the chemical
properties at the synapses depending
upon the light so let's take a look just
at the rod for a minute the rod has this
chemical these discs called made out of
what's called rhodopsin all right and
here you can act these are this is an
electron micrograph of what actually
looks like and this outer segment is
made up of these plates there were
Dobson plates and what happens is is
that the rhodopsin is a chemical that
when it gets hit by photons it splits
into two chemicals and remember both
they're named one of them actually is
associated with vitamin A remember your
mother always told you how to eat your
carrots in order to see well where does
that come from well the vitamin A in
yeah in the carrots is involved in the
chemical that's involved in rods being
able to see light so I'm presuming that
that's why your mother told you that
just ask her all right to stress the
sort of chemical nature of what's going
on there's a slide here that just shows
the same rod and there's sort of this
change in these sodium ions and oh here
I wrote down in the notes that when the
rhodopsin splits one part is called
opsin and the other part is this vitamin
a bit and when light comes in this
change is sometimes referred to as
bleaching the the rods right so they
start to change more in that and how
bleach they are is sort of how adapted
they are right so when they're not
bleached at all a very small amount of
light now coming in will change it
after you believe some a bit now you
need a different you're now operating in
a different light level in fact there
were studies that were done that we're
showing that a single photon so those
are you familiar with the physics of
light a single photon will can make a
change in the cell that this system can
detect which is just remarkable right
the ability of the system detects small
changes in illumination and you can sort
of ignore this diagram over here it's
just showing you that it's understood at
a pretty detailed level how the light
makes a change in the chemistry and that
the chemistry then changes what goes on
in these synapses now we said before
that each of these photo detectors
respond differentially to wavelengths of
light we showed you short medium and
long the one we didn't show you before
it was the one that includes rhodopsin
all right so here's the blue or the
short pigment the green and the red
which we've looked at before and here is
the what the the rod responds to and you
see the rod is relatively broad spectrum
okay which is good it means that if
there's any of this kind of wavelengths
of light coming in at night the rods
will be able to see them even though
they're very very low amount of
illumination that they're sensitive to
we're not going to talk more about cones
and the try stimulus through color
theory of color because we did that last
time but these are the four operating
spectral responses that each of the
photo detectors give you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
