what you can access in memory is really
powerful this is how this we going to be
able to protect the data and code of a
given process and the way we're going to
be able to do it is the operating system
I said is responsible for managing those
phase tables you are talking about
remember you always start with a virtual
address so process a is going to start
with virtual address which has to be
translated with physical address that
should fall in a in a physical page that
we are talking about physical frame so
the operating system will not map
virtual page of a process a because
remember you're going to start with
virtual address that has a virtual page
number and displacement within that it
will not map it virtual place a process
a to a physical page that has been given
to process be ok remember these pages
are reusable resources over time they
get assigned to different processes so
that currently if the a certain physical
page has been assigned to process be
well the operating system is not going
to or it is not going to set up the
phase table of process a such that a
page table entry in that process is
phase table can point to this page that
belongs to be that's our protection
isolation whatever you call it we have
essentially petitioned the physical
memory that we have among the different
processes we have in the system and we
limit these processes to only the the
portion of memory they have access to at
a given time by making sure that they
can only reach those portions through
their page tables and the operating
system is again going to manage the page
tables the trusted computing base if you
trust it to do this right so we keep the
different processes separate from each
other which is what results in there
getting protected from each other and
process a dozen trust process be so as I
explained process a cannot access
process-based memory because it has no
way to read the memory that belongs to
process p this will work as long as this
phase tables are correctly managed and
as I said before
managed by the operating system which is
trusted so let's hope they are correctly
managed unless someone finds a way to
attack and successfully compromised the
operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
