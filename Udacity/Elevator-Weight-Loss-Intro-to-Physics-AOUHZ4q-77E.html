wants to lose weight and he is very
happy because he thinks he's found a
pretty clever way to lose this weight
this man is standing on a scale and as a
quick reminder let's talk about the
forces acting on this man when the
elevator is completely still we can
represent him as a box of mass M gravity
is pulling down with the strength equal
to mg and the normal force is pushing up
with the exact same strength because
he's motionless there's no acceleration
now remember the scale doesn't read mg
it doesn't tell you exactly what your
weight is it tells you how hard it has
to push to keep you from falling through
the scale so this man's realized that if
he can just reduce FN then he can reduce
his perceived weight of course this will
lead to unbalanced forces meaning he'll
have to accelerate downwards in order to
accelerate downwards he's going to need
an elevator this man finds that when
he's at rest in the elevator the scale
says 800 Newtons he wants this scale to
say 600 Newtons now I have two questions
for you first what must his downward
acceleration be to actually see this
target weight of six engines on the
scale next
if he travels at that acceleration for
five seconds and assuming the elevator
started at rest
how far will he travel and this is more
of a review of unit 2 and two your
answers here and here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
