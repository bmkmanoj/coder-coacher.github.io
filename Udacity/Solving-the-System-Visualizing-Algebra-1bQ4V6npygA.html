could come up with two equations for
this problem we used the individual
amounts from each account to equal the
total amount and we use the interest
rates and those amounts to get our total
interest now that we have two equations
we can use them to figure out how much
was invested at each rate i'm going to
show you how to solve the system using
substitution i think it's easier than
elimination because i can either isolate
the X on this first equation or the Y if
i subtract x from both sides i can solve
for y so y would equal ten thousand
minus X now that why I saw four I can
replace this Y with 10,000 minus X this
is my substitution I've made the
substitution in this line then I
distribute the 800s multiplying by
10,000 lose my decimal point right for
places so I get 800 and then I have
minus eight hundred times X for the
second term next i subtract 800 from
both sides I have my constant terms on
the right and then my X terms on the
left next I combine my like terms and i
get negative five thousands times x then
i divide by the coefficient of x to get
x is equal to 2500 but we need to make
sense of what this means let's look back
at our problem x is 2500 well that's the
amount of money I invested at seven and
a half percent knowing this I want you
to finish out the rest of this problem
how much was invested at eight percent
