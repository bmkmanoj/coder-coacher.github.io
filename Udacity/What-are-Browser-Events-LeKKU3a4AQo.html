specific actions occurring at specific
times for instance in the game of
basketball when the ball goes through
the hoop the shooting team gets points
the event is the ball going through the
hoop the resulting action is that the
scoring team gets points the browser has
events as well every time you move your
mouse click on a link submit a form or
do anything really your browser makes an
announcement of the action you just took
I want to show you what the browser is
actually doing Google Chrome provides a
handy function the monitor events
function that will allow you to take a
peek under the hood to see events as
they are taking place you pass to the
function the element on the page that
you want it to watch for events now this
function can only be used in the console
on the chrome dev tools don't try to use
this function in your JavaScript file it
won't work and will cause a reference
error with that disclaimer out of the
way let me show you the feedback it
provides so on this page you can see I
have a simple text field first I'll use
jQuery to select all the inputs on the
page then I'll select just this first
one here next I'm going to call the
monitor events function and pass it the
variable holding the first input field
the monitor events function watches the
element for events and logs them all out
so I'll interact with the text field and
watch Chrome log out all the events as
you can see using the monitor events
function you can observe what the
browser is doing when you interact with
the page elements in different ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
