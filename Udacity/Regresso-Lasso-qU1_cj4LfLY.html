regression can actually make a
regression simpler in terms of the
number of features that it's using so
what it does is for features that don't
help the regression result enough it can
set the coefficient of those features to
a very small value potentially to zero
so imagine that I have up to four
features that are available to me x1
through x4 and I don't know which ones
are the most powerful what are the ones
that I actually want to be using I don't
want to use all of these if I don't have
to and that m1 through m4 are the
coefficients of regression that I get
for these features when I actually
perform the fit so in an ordinary
multivariate regression I would get a
result that looks something like this it
will use all of the features that I make
available to it and it will assign to
each one a coefficient of regression
what lasts over regression will do is it
will try adding them in one at a time
and if the new feature doesn't improve
the fit enough to outweigh the penalty
term of including that feature then it
won't be added and by not added it just
means that it sets the coefficient to
zero so let's suppose that x1 and x2 or
two features that are really critical to
include in our regression they really
describe the pattern with a lot of power
but that x3 and x4 don't improve the fit
by very much they might improve it by a
little bit but we could just be fitting
to noise then what will happen is that
the coefficients for those two features
will be set to zero so m3 will be set to
zero and m4 will be set to zero which
effectively means that these two
features become irrelevant in the fit
and the only thing that's left is x1 and
x2 the original two features that we
wanted to have anyway the power of
regularization the power of having this
penalty term for the extra features is
that it can automatically do this
selection for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
