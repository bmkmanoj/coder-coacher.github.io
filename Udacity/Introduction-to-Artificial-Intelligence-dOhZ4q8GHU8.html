artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence was about creating machines
that were themselves as smart as humans
and along the way the field diverged
into different schools of thought
including cognitive systems which is
focused on thinking like humans and
machine learning which is focused on
creating machines that act autonomously
in general regardless of whether or not
they're thinking like humans do so to
start our conversation about machine
learning let's talk a little bit about
artificial intelligence in general and
where machine learning fits in to do
this we're going to borrow from one of
the classes at Georgia Tech called
knowledge-based artificial intelligence
it's not by show coil and I and the
videos you're about to see are covered
very early in the course if you're
interested you can find a link to the
full course in the instructors notes
