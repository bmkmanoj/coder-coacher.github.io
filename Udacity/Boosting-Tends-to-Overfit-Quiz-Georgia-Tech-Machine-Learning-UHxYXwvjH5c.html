we just tried to argue that boosting has
this annoying habit of not always
overfitting but of course something can
always over fit because otherwise we
just do boosting and we're done and then
neither of us would have jobs and we
don't want that to happen so here's a
little quiz to see if we can figure out
the circumstances under which boosting
might over fit or tends to over fit so
here are five possibilities
let me read them to you tell me if they
actually make sense so here's possible
the number one boosting will tend to
over fit if the weak learner that it's
boosting over always chooses the weakest
output that is among all the hypotheses
that it finds that do better than chance
over the training data with whatever
given distribution it will always pick
the one that is still nonetheless
closest to chance while still being
better well why would it do that just to
be difficult alright and so you want to
know whether that makes it over will
tend to make it over fit will tend to
make boosting over 50 ok all right ok
the second off the second one is a weak
learner actually ends up using or the
weak learner itself that boosting is
using is in fact a neural network
learner and just for a little
specificity let's say this is a neural
network that has many many layers and
many many nodes so you know it's a it's
a big powerful neural network alright
the other option is boosting has a lot
of data so you're trying to learn your
training data is actually very very very
large you have lots and lots of examples
the fourth case is that the true
underlying hypothesis the true
underlying concept is in fact nonlinear
so you can't just draw a line and then
the fifth case is that we let boosting
train much too long whatever that means
let's just say we let it train a lot not
just a thousand iterations but a hundred
billion iteration ok ok
billions and billions of iterations ok
you got it
yeah all right go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
