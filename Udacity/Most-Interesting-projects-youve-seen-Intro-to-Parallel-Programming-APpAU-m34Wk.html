projects that you've seen done with CUDA
from from the beginnings all the way
till today yeah you know one of the
great parts about this job is that I
continuously learn about it fields of
science and computing that I had no idea
existed whether it being a defense or
oil and gas or finance one of my more
favorite projects is the work being done
in like CT scanners a CT scanner is
actually a I don't know if you know how
this works but it's a series of x-rays
they take at different angles and you're
taking 2d x-rays and the Machine
actually composites the x-rays together
and it actually recreates the 3d model
of what's going on inside your lungs or
heart or body or whatever well it's
really cool to get the 3d vision the bad
part of x-rays is the radiation is kind
of harmful in fact you want to kind use
the least amount of radiation but more
x-rays you get the better the view of
the problem you have so what one this
one group is doing is actually they're
using GPUs and they've been able to
reduce the amount of x-ray radiation by
something like 20x really making it much
more safer as a procedure and applying
the power of the GPU to take many more
lower dosage radiation shots and combine
them together to not only get a clearer
picture with less radiation but you get
it really quickly in one setting you
don't have to go home and come back to
figure out if you have XYZ problem or
issue so it's really cool to see that
kind of stuff truly affecting lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
