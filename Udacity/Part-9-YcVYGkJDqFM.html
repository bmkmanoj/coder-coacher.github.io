building coding standards are we
building coding standard for debugging
code I don't know it seems to me that
I've been blamed on a lot of things that
just you know depending on the fact of
having a standard or not but it's a
research setting standards significantly
reduces the number of errors and
software and so we should make note that
there are no standards existing in this
group and then they ought to be done
here's some suggestions but that's a
bigger problem than over interesting
here cream above is noting it let's
continue dr. bot at this point we just
you know there's just the brackets to
close a case statement and then the
method and then the class and then
that's it the code is what is the exit
status if everything runs correctly I
just acted fine shouldn't we be setting
an exit status of zero think that
probably by default is it I don't know I
don't know I think I thought it was by
default that's what walk told me yeah
that was great and I job you have to be
Oh while we're drinkin all was mentioned
praying to a log shouldn't we for the
printing the characters in the wall
illusion that isn't a debug information
does it use of you need to see that they
just really need to see the account
right should we be worried about what's
being print to a kind of a logger and
then what's printed to standard out well
if you're kind of changing the specs on
me but yet if there's has to be a logger
then yeah the code will have to change
well it says here the purpose count the
number of blanks in a sentence right
doesn't say purpose write out all the
things you know as you're going along so
it's the comment wrong or the spectrum
well that's it that's an excellent
question i would say that the
I believed what i read there but I could
be incorrect yeah that's it this becca
this is a program without a
specification I think he just invented
it you know just suggest that I need to
do this he said okay I can do that I
papi code from various places and hack
the same as this way it was nice for the
users to see what gets actually ready
but it doesn't have to be the killer
what kind of users you've been around oh
you know users that can put a period at
the end of the Senators been made very
very very fraught and dr. bug anything
else that's and unbreathing the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
