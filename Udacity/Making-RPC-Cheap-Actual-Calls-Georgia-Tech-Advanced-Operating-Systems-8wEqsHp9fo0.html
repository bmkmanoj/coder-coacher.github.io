the actual calls between the client of
the server and you will see that all the
kernel copying overheads are eliminated
in the actual calls what the client stub
does on the client side is when the
client makes that call as that foo the
client stub is going to take the
arguments and put those arguments into
the haystack
ignore this result for a minute so that
the stub is going to the client stub is
going to prepare the haystack with the
arguments of the call and then the in
the in da stack you can only pass
arguments by value not by reference and
the reason is that this a stack I
mentioned to you is mapped into the
client address space and shortly it's
going to be mapped into there it is it
is mapped into the server address space
as well by the by the kernel and since
only the a stack is mapped into the
address space of both the client and the
server if this has pointers pointing
into other parts of the client address
space server is not going to be act able
to access that so it is important that
the arguments are passed by value and
not by by reference and the work done by
the stub in in preparing the haystack is
much simpler than what I told you
earlier about the general RPC mechanism
of creating an RPC packet where it has
to feel realize the data structures that
are being passed as arguments in this
case it is simply copying the arguments
from the stack of the client thread into
this a stack that's what is being done
by the stub then the client traps into
the kernel making a procedure called s
dot foo that results in a trap and at
this point the the client stub is
presenting to the kernel the binding
object associated with s dot foo so the
binding object I told you is the
capability that this client is
authorized to make calls on s dot foo
so once the be oh is validated by the
kernel it can then see what the
procedure descriptor associated with the
do is and this procedure descriptor is
as I told you the information that is
needed by the kernel
in order to pass the control to the
server to start executing the server
procedure corresponding to this
particular RPC call being made by the
client now recall that the semantics of
RPC is that the client once it makes
this RPC call
it's basically blocked it's waiting for
the call to be complete before it can
start resuming its execution therefore
is an optimization what the kernel could
do is borrow because all of this is
happening on the same machine the kernel
can borrow the client thread and doctor
that client thread to run on the server
address P so what do I mean by doctoring
the client thread what I mean is
basically what you want to do is you
want to make sure that the clients
thread starts executing in the address
space of the server and the PC that the
client thread is going to start
executing in is the entry point
procedure that is pointed to by the
procedure descriptor so you have to fix
up the PC the address space descriptor
and the stack that is being used by the
server in order to execute this entry
point procedure and for this purpose
what the kernel does is it allocates a
special stack which is called the
execution stack I'm not showing you in
this picture
an execution stack or east stack and
that is the stack that the server
procedure is going to use in order to do
its own thing because server procedure
may be making its own procedure calls
and so on so it is going to do all of
that action on the east stack so the a
stack is only for the purposes of
passing the arguments and the e stack is
what the server is going to use in order
to make do its own work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
