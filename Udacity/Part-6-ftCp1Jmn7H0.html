from the lava which means that we
encountered the sentinel which is marked
the end of the of the sentence or are we
directly to the exit well you know we
will have to fix the condition that we
identified but assuming that we we fixed
it what happens if last character is not
a simple well but we tell the user right
that issue follow the initial enter
sentence ending with a period oh that's
right the users are always right with
their responsibility right you have to
take care of all the possibilities here
as you might recall in a keyboard on a
computer to keep the period in the conga
right next to each other and frequently
people punch the wrong one it's called a
slip and in the cognitive world and they
put a comma in and then this thing
Luke's forever i was thinkin hey if
there was an end-of-file without a got a
sentinel at the end even better yeah i
guess then what will get an exception
and will exit right i'm catching the
exceptions without printing anything up
well you know that the user will figure
out that what they did wrong we gave
them instructions I mean I don't know if
we want to count for all the possible
behavior sure I mean just you know let's
agree to do that hey listen son this is
avionics software rubel and hairnet
means planes crash if we can't show your
characters in a sentence it's fine we've
been on my back the whole time but
that's fine main field before we should
account for the for this thing will
welcome for that you want to mark it
down as a as a problem we might be Bob
if you don't mind maybe we need to send
this guy back to the IT department I
think we are really
when I think we have 80 point dr. Burke
gets the point right now look I get the
Pakistani together reiterate that we
have like three or four times but
anyways okay so where was I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
