statement is true and it shows that the
empty problem is undecidable the
reduction is straightforward the output
machine just runs the input machine on
the empty string and if it halts it
accepts if the input machine is in H bar
that means that it loops on the empty
string and so will the output machine
and it will accept nothing on the other
hand if the input machine is not an HTM
that means it does halt and then the
output machine will accept everything
use pencil and paper to confirm that
this reduction works for yourself if you
try to use a similar argument for these
neck reductions you'll find that the
machines output by the reduction except
when you want them to loop or reject and
loop will reject when you want them to
accept but proof by lack of imagination
isn't very satisfactory so let's
actually show that if these statements
were true then we would get a
contradiction if you could find these
reductions then this one would directly
imply that the halting problem is
decidable and this last one would imply
that the empty problem is decidable
let's erase the rest and focus on this
contradiction here we'll let R be the
reduction such that the description of
the machine M is in H if and only if R
of M is in E then we let a be a
recognizer for the complement of e the
complement of e is the set of machines
that accept something we talked about
how we can recognize this language with
the dovetailing strategy before so
assume that a implements that so to
decide H we run M on the empty string
and a on R of M in parallel if M halts
on the empty string we recognize that
fact and if it does not
well then R of M must be in a complement
so a must recognize that and running
these in parallel allows us then to
decide the halting problem one way or
another we're gonna get an answer from
one of these two machines overall then
the moral of the story is that you can't
mapping reduce a recognizable language
like the halting problem
to a co recognizable language like the
empty problem a co recognizable language
by the way is one whose compliment is
recognizable and vice-versa it doesn't
work either keep this in mind when
you're trying to prove undecidability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
