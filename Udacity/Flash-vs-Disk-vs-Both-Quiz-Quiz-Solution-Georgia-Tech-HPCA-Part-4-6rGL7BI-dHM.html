storage comparison quiz the total access
time with the disk will be when we play
a game we will read two gigabytes at a
hundred megabytes a second so we will
spend 20 seconds reading these two
gigabytes and we will also spend ten
seconds writing to the 10 megabytes so
we will spend 30 seconds here and then a
sequential read of the one gigabyte here
will be another 10 seconds so over the
four hours we spend 40 seconds reading
and writing unit using the disk we
repeat that four times and we get 40
seconds times four equals a hundred
sixty seconds with flash we get one
gigabyte per second so we'll get two
seconds and change and another one
second so you get 3.01 seconds times for
we get 12.04 seconds which is way better
than the disk but if all we have is
flash we had to buy a lot of flash and
we probably paid thousands of dollars so
now let's say what happens with the disk
and the four gigabytes of flash the
first time we read these two gigabytes
and another ten megabytes we will read
them in 30 seconds because we are
accessing our disk but then we move them
to the flash the next read is going to
be the one gigabyte again 10 seconds but
we move them to the flash so we spend 40
seconds accessing the disk in the first
round of this and we spend 3 point 01
seconds copying this data to the flash
after that we're having the flash access
time so altogether we have 40 seconds of
disk access time plus one quarter of
this for copying to the flash and three
quarters of this for actually reading
off the flash the same as here for a
total of fifty two point oh four seconds
so although it's slower than pure flash
it's still much faster than pure desk
and this is about as costly as a single
disk because four gigabytes of flash are
not going to cost us that much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
