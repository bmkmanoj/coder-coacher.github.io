Doug
prisma the chief scientist at the office
of the National Coordinator for health
IT and the person as much as anyone
responsible for many of the innovations
in health IT we've been discussing
during this course Doug I imagine you're
probably the busiest person of all the
people i'm interviewing for this course
so i really appreciate you finding the
time particularly when you're on
vacation to be with me in the students
this morning you've sort of been i think
the the futurists the thought leader
when it came to health IT in the future
of health IT at the office of the
National Coordinator I guess we're now
six years into high-tech adoption has
certainly gone up dramatically how do
you feel about where we are at this
point are you satisfied so mark let me
just first say I'm delighted to be here
and have an opportunity to have this
conversation and you know I say hello to
you and to your students and I hope that
we have a good opportunity today to sort
of talk through some of the challenges
that we've had at the office of the
National Coordinator so with respect to
kind of where we are now and where I
think we need to go this has been no
meaningful use was established through
Congress and have very tight timeframes
and we really took the meaningful use
program and divided that into three
different stages roughly speaking
meaningful use stage 1 was about
adoption there certainly you have to
first get people to use electronic
health records and put that information
into electronic formats and before you
can actually go to the next step
meaningful use to is really about
exchange and it's about once it's in an
electronic format is there a way that we
can begin sharing and leveraging that
information so that as patients have
their medical record or their care
delivered in lots of different settings
it's possible that that medical record
and that information can follow them as
they move through the healthcare system
and then when we think about meaningful
use stage 3 we really are talking about
making that information useful making it
useful for doing quality assessment
being able to pool and aggregate and
learn about how it is that we're taking
care of patients so if you think about
meaningful use as being adoption
exchange and then using that information
to improve quality that really defines
the kinds of things that were that we're
trying to accomplish I think it also
fits into what our definition of
interoperability has been and as you
know that is a the Holy Grail if you
will or the thing that we've been
striving to achieve an interoperability
is really about exchanging information
and then using the information that's
been exchanged and so our meaningful use
our approach to meaningful use really is
driving towards this notion of an
interoperable electronic healthcare
record system that will help enable
patients by getting adoption first then
going and making sure that we can
exchange that information and then
making sure that we can use that to
improve quality so we're early in the
process we've really only completed the
first first phase if you will have
meaning to use which is around adoption
and as you've said we've really made
some good progress there we've gone from
about seventeen percent adoption of
electronic health records among sort of
general practice upwards of sixty
sixty-five percent of adoption at this
point and certainly among all of our
academic medical centers and things
we're really approaching ninety
ninety-five percent adoption of
electronic health records and so I think
we can say that meaningful use stage 1
has achieved many of the goals that we
had which was getting people to begin
transferring or transitioning from
paper-based records to electronic locks
meaningful use stage 2 is harder we've
raised the bar interoperability an
exchange of information is a more
complex problem that involves not only
the technology making sure that we've
got systems that can talk with one
another but having the right business
processes and a bit right business
drivers that will make that something
that people will want to do naturally
and so I think when we think about
meaningful use stage 2 it's harder I
think we're early in the process and the
pace is very very fast and so I think we
need to see where we are with meaningful
use stage
two and see what sort of progress that
we've made and I think regardless of
kind of where we are this is a course
that is inevitable I think as we get the
right technology in place and the right
business drivers it's going to become
important that that medical record
begins to be distributed and used to
help support patient care and care
delivery well traditionally the sharing
of health information has involved
something called a health information
exchange which the students won't yet be
familiar with when they see this
interview but they learn that one of the
key problems has been achieving a
sustainable business model for health
information exchange ONC is invested a
lot of money in helping the state's
launch health information exchanges at
the same time the technologies that
people might use to exchange information
or changing dramatically so as you look
ahead what do you see happening in the
in that area sure well I think when we
think about exchange the health
information exchanges really are going
to be a central player in making that
happen I think one thing to remember is
is that the United States is a big place
there's lots and lots of different
organizations and participants in the
healthcare ecosystem if you will and so
it's really not going to be I believe a
one-size-fits-all solution you know I
liken it to the way in which we
currently communicate and exchange
information for example with our family
I'll use email i'll use the telephone
i'll use text messages there's lots of
different mechanisms by which i might
communicate with my family and i think
when we think about the complexity of
the healthcare system we have to
understand that it's not a
one-size-fits-all solution so to that
end I think part of the early work that
we did was to say listen if I'm a doctor
and I just want to send it down to my
local pharmacy it seems a little hard to
say well we have to send it to some big
database centrally and then it has to
come back to that pharmacy and things
like that and so sometimes what we need
are simple ways of exchanging
information like you know
replacing the fax machine if you will
and I think part of what we've tried to
do is with the direct project try to
create mechanisms but that i can send
things directly to someone who needs to
get them whether it's for a consultation
or electronic prescription or the like
but i think that is unnecessary but not
sufficient for the kinds of things that
we'd like to do remember our goal is to
eventually get to the place where we can
exchange and aggregate and analyze and
learn from the information that's there
and I think health information exchanges
are going to be tremendously valuable
particularly as we think about
accountable care organizations and we
think about care that's delivered across
the continuum that includes not only
your primary care doctor but includes
other sub specialists and perhaps there
are home health services and other
things like that that need to be
involved and health information
exchanges I think can really help us
there what we've found though is that
those health information exchanges that
rely simply on paying a toll to send the
information from one place to another if
that's their business model they
struggle that is a hard business model
to sustain because there's always
simpler and easier ways to get around
that so for example although the
telephone company may want you to have a
landline and keep that working in your
in your house you could circumvent that
with your a cellular phone or you could
come circumvent that all entirely by
using Skype or other ways of doing
things so I think business models that
are predicated on just what paying a
toll within the hie s are somewhat
problematic and they will struggle I
think to try to make make sure that they
can provide value those that we've seen
that have been successful however are
those that have been able to move up
what I would call move up the value
chain so rather than just providing a
toll road for information to flow on
they provide additional services so they
are able to find information because
they've got aggregation features that
otherwise would be difficult to get
vaccinations registries for children
that are going to off to camp for
starting school that's oftentimes a hard
thing to sort of find information on and
hie s that provide that as a service I
think we'll find
selves providing additional value to the
to the the folks that use them I also
think with the ACOs it's going to be
very very important the accountable care
organizations it's going to be very
important that people understand where
the high cost patients are being taken
care of and if there are ways that they
can reduce those costs and that's going
to take the aggregation of lots of
different pieces of information and so I
think hie s that can kind of move up
from being just a toll road in which
information flows to something that
provides a lot of additional value with
analytics and connecting the dots and
making sure that doctors have a full
picture of the patients that they take
care of I think those are the ones that
are going to succeed as we go forward
well those are great comments I hope the
students keep those in mind as we move
into the topic of health information
exchange in as we look at the Indiana
health information exchanges maybe the
premier example of value-added services
well let's get back to this topic of
interoperability I remember when
high-tech was first announced I was very
surprised to hear pushback about doing
it then from long time a chai tea
advocates who said that we'd be
deploying a whole bunch of non
interoperable systems that might be
frozen in place forever making an
interoperability impossible to achieve
contrast that with the recent JSON
report which the students don't actually
know about yet but a report by a group
of distinguished scientists that points
the way toward what they call a robust
interoperability framework for
healthcare in the United States how do
you see this unfolding how are we going
to turn these hundreds of different
brands of electronic health and personal
health and other record systems into
something that is robust as the Jason
report envisions yes and you know this
has been one of the fundamental issues
that we've been working on I think
within the office of the National
Coordinator so we've had a number of
years probably 10 or 12 years in which
there are organizations that have worked
on developing standards and
specifications that would support
interoperability we have organized a
like the integrating the health
enterprise or IH e which does a
tremendous amount of work on trying to
develop all of the pieces that would
allow interoperability to occur both
within an enterprise and across
different enterprises hl7 as a standards
organization has also worked on both
creating interoperability within the
enterprise as well as between different
organizations but we've done that
oftentimes by developing the standards
first and then hoping based on our best
guesses that this will serve the needs
of the folks that are outfit some have
been tremendously successful and others
I think have languished or have had head
struggles and I think when we started
with opposite the National Coordinator
and down this path towards
interoperability we were faced with a
conundrum do we wait until the systems
are perfect and that we've been able to
demonstrate interoperability or is the
best way to achieve interoperable
solutions is to get things out there and
to try to make sure that people have
things that are electronic and then
begin struggling about creating that
interoperability I think what we decided
was that it's difficult to predict or
develop interoperable solutions in a
committee you really need to get it out
there and you need to make it work and
that's how you're going to be able to
sort of struggle through the complexity
because interoperability is the devil is
in the details it's really a good
concept but you have to be able to
define it again if you think about the
definition the I Triple E definition of
interoperability it's it's it's it's
about exchange and it's about use and so
the use of the information means that
interoperability can't be defined in the
abstract it has to be defined in
actually doing something and so I think
we decided early on that the way to get
to interoperability was to get things
out there and to try to get them working
and then struggle if you will to try to
make sure that we get those pieces right
not to try to make the whole system kind
of top-down perfect but to try to figure
out ways that we could let real uses
bubble up and provide the mechanisms for
interoperable
so to that end one of the things that
we've done is we've also tried to
mitigate our risk and we've modeled a
lot of what we've done off of the way in
which the internet is organized so when
they created the basic functionality to
support the internet what they didn't do
was create some big system that had
perfect ways of representing information
that these physicists wanted to use and
created kind of the the system that
everybody would have to interact with
one giant database if you will well what
they did instead is they said let's
create a standard for how we format
information let's create a way that we
define specific keywords so that the
computer and the browsers can understand
that let's let's provide specific
formats for how we move information
around and how we secure that
information and so our approach has been
to break the puzzle up into really five
fundamental building blocks that support
interoperability and that are modeled on
the way in which that the Internet has
been established so we try to
standardize five things we standardized
meaning through vocabularies and
terminologies we standardized formats
through hl7 and other kinds of
structures that allow us to move that
information around we standardize
transport using specific ways of moving
that information money of them based on
secure email or based on web services
and then we standardize security so that
I can equip it encrypted on my end and
you can decrypt it on your end now if
you take those four things meaning
structure transport and security and you
package them together you get
essentially what would be the
fundamental pieces of an application
programming interface or an API and in
the Jason report which hopefully people
have an opportunity to read about they
really talk about using api's as the way
of creating this framework for how that
information can flow and many of their
api's are also organized according to
the layers of that particular stack you
know so a stat
that helps us with meaning and
vocabulary another one that helps us
with how we access data in structured
ways another that helps us with
authentication and with security and so
in fact many of the things that we've
been working on within ONC creating
those building blocks are also mirrored
in the JSON report that's coming out so
it's not a perfect system in fact we
still have a lot of work that we need to
do and we have to move forward but we
don't think we can get to
interoperability from a top-down
approach we really need to kind of not
not even a bottom-up we have to do it
from the middle out and by creating
these fundamental building blocks many
of them that look like those that are
used in the Internet by taking an
incremental approach where we focus on
those things that have high value again
related to the conversation around hie s
and then incrementally over time build
out the various api's and the various
standards that we need we think that we
can achieve interoperability at least
around some things and that we can over
time make it more and more interoperable
as we go forward within the internet we
are at HTML version 5 and so we've had
five iterations and the standards that
we use to describe that and i would say
that within healthcare we're really not
even quite to HTML version 1 and i think
we're still going to need some time to
get some additional work done and it's
going to be students and people who are
trained in in informatics that are going
to be able to help us get them as you
look out over the next few years what do
you see happening from ONC and a chai
tea in general well i think you know as
we come into meaningful use stage 3 i
think there's a tremendous number of
people at CMS and at ONC and others that
are really trying to define what the
specification should be within them it's
it's there's a lot of conversations that
are ongoing at this point it's difficult
to really know kind of where we're going
to land with that but I think what we
want to do is we want to make sure that
we've learned the right lessons from
meaningful use stage 1 that we are
looking at meaningful use stage 2 to see
what's working there
what's not working there and trying to
make refinements that we need to do and
then to look ahead to where it is that
we want to go one of our one of my
favorite phrases is that we you know in
addition to not letting perfect be the
enemy of good we don't want good to be
the enemy of better and what that means
is is that we sort of want to take this
path of least one to go down a way that
we can create that incremental approach
to getting to where we want to go and
not get in the way of getting to a
better place as we as we move forward so
as we look at meaningful use stage three
we really want to make sure that people
who were early adopters of electronic
health records that have supported the
meaningful use stage 1 and meaningful
use stage 2 programs continue to be
successful than the things that they're
working on and then what we want to do
is we want to say are there other things
that people are telling us are
significant value added propositions if
you will that would allow us to get to a
better place and how can we make sure
that as we create this incremental path
that we continue to move towards that
that better place that we'd like to like
to be you have to remember too that
meaningful use is really composed of two
different kinds of regulations the first
is around the electronic health record
in this and the kinds of technical
capabilities that that the electronic
health record needs to have to support
the doctrine to support information
exchange and to support the other goals
and then the second part is having the
doctor use that information and
demonstrate that they're able to sort of
provide increased quality or that
they're providing better access to that
information as well I think as we look
at meaningful use stage three we really
have to think about adoption exchange
and then what are the important uses
that we'd like to see that and i think
one piece that's that's important also
to consider is the work that we've done
on making sure that patients have access
to their information as well and that's
I think a fundamental need to make sure
that we include the patient in this
health ecosystem because otherwise I
mean to me it would be
a tragedy if what we ended up with was a
separate but equal system one system for
the health care system and one for
patients and consumers and others that
are interested in proving their health I
think when we think about accountable
care organizations when we think about
how we take care of all these patients
we have to make sure that the patient is
considered a first-order participant in
their healthcare and their healthcare
delivery a dog I want to thank you again
for taking the time with us I suggest
the students may want to watch this
interview again toward the end of the
course because you've sort of woven
together many of the themes that we we
pursue throughout the whole course so
thank you so much for taking the time to
be with us thanks so much mark and I
wish you and the students well as they
sort of help us get to a better place
with health information technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
