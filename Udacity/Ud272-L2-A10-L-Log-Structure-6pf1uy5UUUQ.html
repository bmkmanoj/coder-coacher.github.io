command line interface running the
Heroku logs command will list the last
100 lines of logs that Hiroko has
recorded you can also pass the dash n
flag followed by number to retrieve that
many log lines up to 1,500 here you can
see we are retrieving 300 lines at first
these logs can seem like gibberish but a
closer look will reveal a pattern the
Heroku logs are broken up into four
parts the timestamp the source the dyno
and the message the timestamp is the
first thing you'll see it'll show the
year month and day followed by the time
in 24-hour format after the timestamp
you will see either the word app or the
word Heroku this is a source of the log
the source will allow you to
differentiate between things that your
application is doing and things that
Heroku is doing in brackets following
the source will be the dyno the dyno
specifies the kind of process that is
taking place a few examples you might
encounter our web run API and router
finally you will see the log message the
message will look very similar to log
messages you've seen in your development
environment sometimes it's difficult to
remember exactly what you were doing at
a particular time when an error occurred
thankfully you don't have to Heroku
allows you to run the logs command and
keep it listening for log output by
using the dash dash tale flag with this
flag you will be able to see the
application collecting log output in
real time here we can see what happens
when we click on the new art piece
button and to stop the logs from
collecting simply press ctrl C</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
