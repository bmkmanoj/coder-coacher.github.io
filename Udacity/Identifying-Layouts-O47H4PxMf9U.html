UI you might recognize this as something
similar to Gmail how would you go about
constructing this UI in most situations
where you have stacked content like this
one on top of another it's likely you'll
want to use a linear layout now the red
toolbar at the top which we'll go into
in a bit later on in the course is going
to have a fixed height and the second
view in the linear layout whatever that
is should take up the remaining space
here you can see if I stretch it out the
red toolbar remains the same height but
the list expands to fill the space so
the way we do that is we set a weight of
1 and a height of 0 DP the 0dp height
tells us that we aren't using a fixed
value here and all be worked out later
now below this toolbar is this list and
this floating red button here which
we'll go into again later now because
these elements overlap each other will
want to use a frame layout for the list
we use a list view or a recycler view so
that will be the first child and it will
have a layout width and height of match
parent the button will then be the
second child with a gravity of bottom
end and a generous layout margin
something like 16 DP to move it away
from the edges and in case you're
wondering the frame layout should be the
one that has the zero dip height and
layout weight of 1 here's another
similar example based on a contacts app
say for creating a new contact now in
this situation you again have a toolbar
at the top with a scrolling section
below it since we have a fixed set of
form fields instead of a ListView we're
going to use a scroll view that holds a
grid layout the grid layout contains a
left column with icons and which
identify the form of sections and then a
right column containing the form fields
themselves now when using a scroll view
you can only contain one child view and
that child should have its height based
on its contents that's why we use wrap
content
for the height of the grid layer one
quick note here if we want the toolbar
to scroll off the form would simply move
the toolbar inside of the grid view as
its first row and set its layout columns
span to two so it fills both columns
let's look at one final more complicated
example this resembles an app's detailed
page in the Play Store we can see
there's a banner image at the top with
an overlay toolbar on top of the image
below that there's a scrollable white
pane with details of the app now the
overall composition is a frame layout
because we want the toolbar to overlay
the image banner and the entire screen
to be scrollable the first child is an
image view because we wanted to be
behind everything else it has a fixed
height but its width can vary so we use
a scale type of Center crop to ensure
that the image itself always covers the
entire banner area next is a scroll view
which contains a vertical linear layout
because we want this to appear in front
of the image when scrolling but behind
the toolbar the linear layout itself has
a white background but it's offset by
200 DP using top padding on the scroll
view this makes the image visible behind
it but as you scroll the image becomes
obscured by the scroll B's background
the final child of the frame now is this
toolbar which sits on top of everything
else with a transparent background now
when composing this kind of UI you'll
likely want to do some tricks to slowly
move the image at a different rate to
scrolling or perhaps fade in a
background on the toolbar and the title
as we scroll there's some common
techniques that we'll going to go
through later in the course on how to go
about doing this now finally for the
things inside the linear layout we can
use nested layouts such as I never
horizontal linear layout for these
buttons across here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
