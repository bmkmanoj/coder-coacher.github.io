and as much as I like cake especially
chocolate cake let's see how else we can
use our fractions even if I spend all
that time baking I'd probably want to go
outside so let's see our fractions in
another context walking so here's our
next problem with fractions you walk two
fifths of a kilometer and then three
tenths of a kilometer how far did you
walk when they eat about this problem I
know I need to do something with these
fractions I'm trying to figure out the
total distance I have to walk so I
should probably add these fractions
together so i have two fifths add it to
the three tenths here again i don't have
common denominators I can't just add
these together so let's see what we can
do but you might be wondering what's a
kilometer a kilometer is a measure of
distance we use the letters km to stand
for kilometer there's also the word kilo
kilo means a thousand so we know one
kilometer is really a thousand meters
and you're probably wondering what's
that distance like so here's a picture
of about a kilometer in New York City
Central Park is about 849 meters across
849 meters is just shy of a thousand
meters so we know Central Park is about
a kilometer but a little bit less than
that if you wanted to see for yourself
how long the kilometer is you could go
outside it takes about 12 minutes to
walk a kilometre depending on how fast
you walk all right now that we know what
a kilometer is let's get back to problem
solving okay I've rewritten our problem
at the top you walk two-fifths of a
kilometer and then walk three tenths of
a kilometer how far did you walk let's
picture this using a kilometer I'm going
to draw a bar that represents a
kilometer so this distance or the full
bar would be one kilometer two-fifths of
a kilometer it would only be this much
let's do the same thing for three tenths
let's split up our kilometer bar into
tents so I have a full kilometer bar I
have tents and three of them are shaded
to represent three tenths of a kilometer
if I wanted to add two fists and
three-tenths together it looked like
this I would have the two fifths and
then the three tenths don't follow the
trap of thinking this is five out of 15
I don't have 15 equally divided regions
here even though I have five of them
they're not equally spaced I can't add
two fifths
and three tens together because I'm not
dealing with the same dimensions or
links I know one-fifth of a kilometer is
actually longer than one-tenth of a
kilometer so I can't simply add fifths
and tents together remember I need to
get a common denominator so what do you
think what would be the common
denominator for two fifths and
three-tenths you can enter your answer
in this box here just give me only the
denominator what would you change tents
and fifths into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
