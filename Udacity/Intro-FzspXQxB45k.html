welcome you back to introduction to
computer vision as you can tell I'm sort
of energized and I've taken some time
off about a year or two so anyway I what
we're going to do this time is start
working on tracking so the last unit or
at least some previous one hopefully
that depend upon the order in which
you're viewing these we were looking at
motion which was sort of the change in
imagery between two successive frames
and that change could be due to a change
in viewpoint multiple cameras or change
in time you're watching something move
or for a while this unit is going to
focus on tracking where objects are
moving over time and the computations
that we're doing our to keep track of
them and it is sort of a fundamental
part of computer vision these days
although a lot of what we're going to be
talking about will eventually get into
things that are come from the domain of
robotics because there there's been a
lot of work done on sort of how you keep
track of things over time we'll do a lot
of modeling also want to say again a
bunch of slides dapped it from kristen
graham endeavor ramen and it's about a
lot of lube nick and i spent lana if i
messed up your name i'm sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
