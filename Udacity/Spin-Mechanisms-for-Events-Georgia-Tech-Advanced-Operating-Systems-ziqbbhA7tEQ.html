events for example external interrupts
that may come in when a process is
executing or the process itself may
incur some exceptions such as a page
fault or it may make system calls all of
these are events that needs to be
fielded by the operating system and spin
has to support such external events and
spin supports such external events using
an event based communication model
services can register what are called
event handlers with the spin event
dispatcher and spin supports several
types of mapping it supports a
one-to-one mapping between an event and
a handler it also supports one-to-many
mapping between an event and the
handlers and it also supports many to
one mapping many events may map to the
same Handler and let's look at concrete
examples to illustrate the power of this
mapping and how it might help in
building system services and what this
picture is showing you is a typical
protocol stack and you may have several
different interfaces available on your
machine and therefore a network packet
may arrive through one of several
interfaces let's say you have an
Ethernet interface and you have an ATM
interface a network packet may arrive on
the Ethernet port or an ATM port those
are events and both of those may be IP
packets in which case there's an IP
handler that needs to see the events and
so here is an example of many events
mapping to the same handler Ethernet
packet arrival as an event ATM packet
arrival of an event different events but
they map to the same handler which is
the IP handler that's an example of many
to one mapping the processing of the
packet by those IP handler results in an
IP packet arrival event and there will
be several clients of the IP layer of
the protocol stack there may be a UDP
transport
maybe TCP transport the ravine ICMP
layer that are all sitting on top of
this IP network layer so when an IP
packet arrival event is triggered by
this handler there are multiple clients
for that and this is an example of a
one-to-many mapping one event to
multiple handlers that need to get
triggered and the spin dispatcher allows
any number of handlers to be registered
as handling a particular event type and
when that event type is raised then all
the handlers associated with that event
type will get scheduled by the spin
dispatcher the order in which they get
scheduled is not something that the
designer can count on because spin has
freedom in the order in which these
event handlers may get scheduled when a
particular event arrives but all the
handlers that are associated with an
event will get triggered when the event
is raised that's an example of one too
many mapping and finally here is an
example of a one-to-one mapping if it's
an ICMP packet the ICMP handler
processes the IP packet and if it is an
ICMP packet then it raises an event that
an ICMP packet has arrived and maybe
there is only one client for that
particular event and that maybe the pink
program so that's a one-to-one mapping
even handlers may also be specified with
guards for finer green handler execution
for example this handler could specify
that only when IP packets arrive it
should be executed so that's a guard
that the IP packet handler could specify
so that even though different kinds of
packets may arrive on these interfaces
this handler will only get triggered
when the packet that arrived on these
different interfaces is an IP packet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
