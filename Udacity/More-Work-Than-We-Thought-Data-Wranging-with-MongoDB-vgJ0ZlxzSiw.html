data we need we need to look at how we
programmatically construct requests in
order to pull each page of data that
we're going to need remember each time
through we're going to be passing a
carrier value and an airport value so
the best way I think to do this is to
use the browser to tell us how it makes
requests to the site because the browser
is obviously successfully making those
requests and receiving the results now
to do that we can take a look at the
network tab now I've just opened this so
at this point there are no network
requests captured in order to get those
what we're going to need to do is submit
our request again now it's possible when
you do that if you've had the page open
for a while that you'll actually get an
error page instead if that's the case
just copy this into a new tab and load
it as if you're loading it for the first
time simply trying to reload the page
won't work for you alright so let's
scroll to the top here and we can see
right here that a post request was
submitted if we click on that that will
allow us to actually take a look at the
HTTP that was sent across they request
itself as its encoded as HTTP in order
to retrieve this page full of data this
is the same page we've been looking at
all along now what I'm interested in is
exactly what data is submitted for this
particular form so going back to the
network tab what I want to do is scroll
down until I find form data and right
away I realize that we have more work to
do than we might have originally
expected this is a perfect example of
why we want to use the browser to figure
out how to construct our requests to
this point we've been operating under
the admittedly naive assumption that all
we were going to need to submit or the
carrier and Airport as the form data in
order to fetch each page you're
interested in but we can see right here
that there are at least three more
fields that we're going to need to
submit and it's not clear at all to us
at this point where this value comes
from so that's more work to do for us
but this is exactly the type of
situation that this particular class is
about in some sense we're essentially
bending the web to our will
this is where we're really getting into
the meat of data wrangling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
