implementing this Andrews system which
is intended for a campus environment
user community consisting of students
who can login to workstations anywhere
on campus and those workstations are
connected by unsecure Network links to a
central server and that central server
is the repository for all the files of
the entire user community so the
challenges include authenticating a user
that is when a user says I'm Kishore the
system has to verify unambiguously
that the user indeed is Kishore a second
challenge is authenticating the server
that is if I as a user log into a
workstation and I get a message from the
server I have to be assured that this
message is actually coming from the
server and not some Trojan horse that is
pretending to be the server the third
challenge is preventing replay attacks
and what that means is that even though
we're using encryption to secure the
data that is going on the wire someone
that is sniffing the wire could grab a
packet and then resend that same packet
and that should not fool either the
sender or the receiver that's what is
meant by replay attack and the fourth
challenge is of course ensuring that the
user community is shielded from one
another either due to unintended
interference of one user on another or
malicious interference both of those
situations have to be avoided so that is
what is meant by isolating the users so
these are the design challenges for the
Android system so in the Andrew file
system they decided in order to make
sure that all of these challenges are
met they have to use a secure RPC as the
basis for client-server communication
and in implementing the secure RPC they
also decided to use private key crypto
and I mentioned that the public key
cryptosystem does not have the key
distribution problem but on the other
hand for a close community like a campus
environment the key distribution problem
is not as big a challenge and therefore
the designers of and refined system
decided to use private key cryptosystem
as I mentioned earlier in the private
key cryptosystem in order to identify
what key used to decrypt a message that
is coming in the identity of the sender
has to be known so this has to be sent
in clear text if you take a traditional
operating system like UNIX you have
username and password which is the way
you aught Senta kate yourself with a
system but in a campus environment if
we're going to use secure RPC as a
mechanism for communication between the
client and the server that can be lots
of communication that is happening
between individual clients and the
server's
and if you're going to use username and
password
all the time for such communication such
overuse will result in a security hole
one of the things that I mentioned as a
principle proposed by Jerome Saltzer
is you publish the design but protect
the keys but you publish the design but
protect the keys and what is meant by
protecting the keys is making it
computationally hard to break the key
but over exposing the key allows someone
to take a long time to crack the key and
therefore overusing username and
password as the basis for all
communications in a secure RPC will
pause a security hole so the dilemma
that the Andrew file system designers
had to face was what to use as the
identity that needs to be sent in clear
text and what to use as the private key
so that we don't overuse any pair of
identity and private keys for a long
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
