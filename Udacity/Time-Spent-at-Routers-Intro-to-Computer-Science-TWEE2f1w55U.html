question instead of doing it by hand I'm
gonna let - do the work what I've done
is I've collected together the data from
the question the total time of the
round-trip for the data which was 75
milliseconds the one-way distance which
was two and a half thousand kilometres
the speed of light in our optic fiber
which is two hundred thousand kilometers
per second now note that this is
kilometres per second but the total time
is in milliseconds which means I'm going
to need a conversion between
milliseconds and seconds let's think
what do I need to calculate well what I
want to know is the total time at
routers working backwards from what I
want to know let's see what I need to
calculate well the total time spent at
the routers is equal to the total time
minus the time at on the wires how am I
going to calculate the time on the wires
that's on the fiber while it's in the
fiber optics rather than actually at the
routers so the time on the wires well
that's equal to well how do we calculate
time when we've got distances and speed
well it's simply distance divided by
speed now what distance are we using
well the total time at the routers is
equal to total time now that's actually
the time for the round-trip so we need
to know how long the data is on the
fiber optics for the round-trip which
means we need to go twice the distance
and that's the one-way distance twice
the one-way distance and we're going to
divide by the speed that the data is
traveling in the wires which is the
optical speed now at the moment we've
got what have we got here we've got
kilometers divided by kilometres per
second which is going to give us an
answer in seconds but our times are
measured in milli
seconds so that seconds at the moment
when we want to convert it into
milliseconds so we have to do it as we
have to multiply it by the number of
milliseconds per second so that's our
conversion factor which is milliseconds
per second let's see what happens
75 that's a bit weird isn't it because
the total time was 75 so what's gone
wrong well let me just print out here
the time on the wires zero well that
doesn't make sense does it because it's
been somewhere let's come back it can't
have taken zero time so what's the
problem here
well the problem is this division what
we have in Python at least before
Version three is that division is
integer division so if the number is
less than one which it will be here
because the one way distance is only two
and a half thousand and we're dividing
by two hundred thousand Python just
rounds it to the nearest branch it down
to the nearest integer which is zero so
in order to deal with that I'm just
going to make it into a float which
means that it does division normally and
gives an answer which is a decimal you
can convert all of these into floats but
really we just need to do one of them
and if I run it now I find that the
first value here 25 is the amount of
time on the wires and the total time
arouses is 50 milliseconds so you need
to be a little bit careful to make sure
that you're doing float division floats
just a decimal division instead of
integer division</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
