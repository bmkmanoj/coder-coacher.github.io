multiplying complex numbers together but
what if we have a situation like this or
we have one complex number divided by
another complex number since right now
both the numerator and the denominator
each have a real and an imaginary
component and one is not directly a
factor of the other one we can't do
anything with this expression we often
encounter fractions like this and
usually what we do to manipulate them
differently is to change the denominator
in some way what I'd like us to do then
is to figure out how to change the
denominator of this fraction so that it
ends up being the smallest real number
we can make it other than 0 of course
since we don't want to divide by 0 so
think critically about the past few
because as we've done and what you can
multiply one complex number by to get a
real number fill in whatever we need to
multiply the top and the bottom of this
fraction by to come up with an
equivalent fraction that has a real
number in the denominator I know this is
new and it probably feels a little bit
difficult right now but just give it a
shot and if you feel like you need to
review a little bit to be prepared for
this question you can go back and watch
the past couple of videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
