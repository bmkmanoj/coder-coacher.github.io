the contradiction we checked that in the
two quizzes and we didn't make any
mistake here one thing that could be
wrong is that we just cannot run the
program inverse hold on itself but again
this is perfectly fine because inverse
halt is a program and because it's a
program we also have its source codes so
we can easily feed this program to
itself so let's go back one more step
step number three the program inverse
halt how we wrote that did we make any
mistake here well no we didn't we just
use the algorithm halt we gave it a
valid input so we gave it a program to
check and we give it also an input for
that program sometimes it might be
confusing that the program is both an
input and an actual program but it's
perfectly fine again because the program
here is a source code so we can take it
as both the rest of the code is fully
valid so it's deterministic there
doesn't really go anything wrong here so
this contradiction here cannot be due to
step 4 it can also not be due to step 3
what about step two well that there is
an algorithm halt for the halting
problem was a direct conclusion of
assumption number one so there also
cannot be something wrong with number
two unless of course number one in
itself was wrong and since we checked
two three and four and there must be
some sort of error in the proof the only
place where this error can be is here in
step number one so what does step number
one say step number one assumed that the
halting problem is in fact decidable and
since this logically leads us to
contradiction this assumption here must
be false so the halting problem cannot
be decidable it is in fact undecidable
and that of course means that there is
no algorithm that will tell you for any
given program and any given input if
that program will ever stop now the
technique that we used here at least if
you are not used to it can sometimes be
a little bit confusing I would therefore
like to give you a second illustration
of exactly this proof here just to make
sure that you understand it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
