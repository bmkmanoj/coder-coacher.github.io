number come from how do we get 85% and
the calculate percent error is a pretty
straightforward calculation all we do is
look at the absolute error so in this
case the absolute error was Plato's
guess 74,000 minus the actual
circumference of the earth
40,000 so we look at this absolute error
and we divide by the true circumference
so in this case 40,000 kilometers when I
do this I get 74 minus 40
so 34,000 over 40,000 the absolute error
over the known circumference and we can
see we can do something canceling we're
left with 34 over 40 reduces to 17 over
20 or 85% now this is something we'll be
doing quite frequently in this class
when we want to talk about error now
Plato wasn't the only person to make a
guess about the circumference of the
earth after Plato another famous and
brilliant thinker made a guess at the
circumference of the earth and that was
Archimedes now Metis guessed that the
earth had a circumference of 300
thousand stadia I want you to tell me
how far off was Archimedes
what was his percent error you can enter
your number here and you don't need to
include the percent sign some additional
information you may need to use to make
this calculation is that the true
circumference of the earth is 40
thousand kilometers one stadium is 185
meters and one kilometer is 1,000 meters
and to your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
