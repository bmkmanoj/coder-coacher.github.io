believe I can so the first thing to note
is that because we're sticking with just
0 and 1 and not all possible values in
between we aren't thinking about a
binary function and the output is also
binary which makes me think of boolean
functions where 0 represents false and 1
represents true which is a common trick
in machine learning alright so let me
let me mark those on the picture here so
we're talking about the only four
combinations are here and you're saying
in particular that we're interpreting
these as combinations of true and false
so right false false true false false
true and true true exactly and if you
look at it the only way that you get
something above the line is when both
are true and that is called and I'll
also take conjunction right exactly so
exactly so so this is even though we're
you know we're setting these numerical
values but it actually is it gives us a
way of specifying a kind of logic gate
right so here's a question for you
Michael could we do or that that's a
very good question or looks a lot like
and in this space it seems like it ought
to be possible so let's let's do that as
a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
