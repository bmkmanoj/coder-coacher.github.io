okay so we're going to use its it's
referred to as probabilistic PCA but
we're basically going to use PCA and
given some possible location we have to
evaluate that observation is saying well
how likely is it that that's the right
place and what it's going to mean is how
well can i generate that and the map
that was done here this is the math to
sort of justify this idea of distance
from facespace all right so here's the
idea let's suppose I have some I ghen
vector subspace this is face space and
that's written as B here ok and so
that's just shown as this plane in 3d so
the idea being I'm only using two
dimensions let's say so I'm assuming
everything's in a plane and furthermore
it's got some mean value there and in
this plane is I'm in facespace all right
and what this little lips shows you is
this is sort of the probabilistic
distribution of how the faces fall
within that space and now I have some
observations II hear what this equation
is saying here is that the probability
of getting some point Z our observation
okay is distributed about the mean okay
so then what's the most likely face the
most likely face is the mean face the
mean is the average right that's the
most like that's the center of the
normal distribution and what this
equation says is that the probability
sort of breaks down into two parts
there's a distance that has to do with
sort of your your covariance or your
variances in the face space and then
there's a distance that's sort of out of
phase space the amount of difference
from the reconstruction so that's
written like this where the idea is that
this BB transpose that's the covariance
matrix sort of within face space and
then we're going to just say some
epsilon I I is an identity matrix
epsilon is some small number so things
get to come out of that plane a little
bit okay so faces are mostly in phase
space and they move away a little bit
now what happens is
is as epsilon goes to zero or just as
epsilon becomes small or another way of
saying that is that the variance within
facespace covers most of the faces and
there's only a little bit of variance
left what this says is that really you
can think of that as this variance
becomes bigger and bigger that the only
thing that matters is how far you are
out of phase space so it's mostly a
function between the point Z that you've
observed and the facespace that's
spanned by these vectors so the math
behind this can be written as the
following way what this says is that P
of Z given B so the probability of some
observation given facespace is an
exponential so it's going to be a
decreasing as a function of the square
of this term and what this term is is
it's the difference so Z minus mu is
this okay subtract off the
reconstruction so this little blue thing
is the reconstruction so if i subtract
that off all I get is this distance to
face space and so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to evaluate the distance to
face space for the reconstruction and
you later when we're tracking something
else is going to be the distance to
whatever my eigen space is so a question
is why is that term the reconstruction
why is that term the projection of Z
onto that plane well it's actually
pretty straightforward so if B is d by K
all right B transpose just K by K by D
all right so what is Z minus u z minus U
is just the vector of the new
observation minus the mean okay so B
transpose times Z minus you that's just
the dot product of all the eigen vectors
with Z minus you that's just the
coefficient vector so this thing right
there B transpose ax minus you that's
the coefficient vector and we can call
that gamma all right well given the
coefficient vector I can reconstruct how
do i do that i just multiply that I'm
multiply B times the coefficient vector
that will be the each coefficient times
each of the eigenvectors summed up so
that's the reconstruction so when I'm
all done this Z minus mu minus the total
reconstruction gives me just the amount
that you're out of that plane that
you're out of the facespace or the
eigenspace another way of saying it is
that's how much of the signal you cannot
reconstruct using the vectors that are
just in that basis set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
