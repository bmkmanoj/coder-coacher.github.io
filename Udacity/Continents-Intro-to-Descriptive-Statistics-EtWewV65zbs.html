frequencies in each country belonging to
the different continents there are two
students from Canada three from Mexico
and ten from the US so if we add them we
get 15 students from North America and
similarly 4% are from Canada 6% from
Mexico and 20% from the US so if we add
them we get 30% we have 12 students from
China 8 from India
8 from Japan and 1 from Pakistan so if
we add them we get 29 students from Asia
24 plus 16 plus 16 plus 2 is 58 and
finally we have 2 from England 3 from
Germany and one from Sweden making 6
from Europe 4% + 6 % + 2 % is 12% so now
we have even more simplified data while
this is interesting and provides new
information now we can't know how many
people are from individual countries
just by looking at this table creating
this table was convenient because it
gave us fewer categories to look at 3
categories in this case but we lost
information in the process
in other words information about
specific countries when creating
frequency distribution tables there can
sometimes be a trade-off between
convenience and informative nough snow
one right way of presenting the data it
all depends on what kind of question you
want to answer in this case if you want
to know how many students are from North
America organizing it like this is best
but if you want to know how many
students are from India or other
specific countries organizing it like
this is best the key is to know how
you're going to organize your data based
on the questions that you want to answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
