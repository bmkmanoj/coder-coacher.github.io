mysterious words start showing up every
now and then fault if you see log
messages about folds set your worries
aside it's not your fault and everything
is ok before we explain what a fault is
and why it makes score data such a
useful tool for iOS development let's go
back to table views for a second a table
view never loads all the cells at once
that would be incredibly wasteful think
of a fetch request that returns 1
million objects and you try to display
them in a table view would 1 million
cells be created at once of course not a
table view is smarter than that the
table view by using its data source will
only load the cells that are visible in
a given moment this means that cells are
created on a per need basis which
optimizes performance and memory usage
this is such a brilliant idea that it's
using many other places in cocoa such as
collection views let's take a look at
one when I scroll up and a cell
disappears it gets removed from memory
this is only the view but wouldn't it be
great to have the model object being
displayed in the cell to be removed from
memory once it's not needed anymore
that's exactly what core data does by
using folds so hang on there and we'll
explain it in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
