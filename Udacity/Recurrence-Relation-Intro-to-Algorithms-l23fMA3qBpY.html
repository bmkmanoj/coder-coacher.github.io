recurrence relation which is a kind of
recursive mathematical function which is
a good match for this recursive
algorithmic expression for a rec Russian
so rec Russian recurrence relation
looking at the structure of rec Russian
if a is 0 then it's gonna execute one
statement basically the test to see
whether it's zero and then returned
otherwise if a is bigger than zero and
even let's take a look at what rec
Russian does in that case so we come in
here with a number that is even and
greater than zero it's going to execute
the condition of this if statement which
fails so there's 1 of that then one more
to do this plus it's going to
recursively work out the value of this
quantity and then one more operation to
multiply that by 2 I call it a total of
3 plus however long it takes to multiply
a over 2 times B now we don't know what
that is we're imagining that we're going
to be able to create a function T that
is going to give us the answer to that
so let's just leave it at that for now
and finally in the case where a is odd
it's going to execute the condition of
this if statement the condition of this
8 if statement both of which will fail
then it will recursively compute the
product and then basically execute the
return so a total of 3 statements plus
however long it takes to do the
recursive call so three statements plus
this particular kind of recursive call
so this now is a as a mathematical
specification of a function we don't
know at the moment what the relationship
is between a and T of a but at least
it's fully specified now it turns out
that you actually can solve this pretty
easily by using what we already worked
out about the number of times you can
divide a number a in half rounding down
if it's odd before you get down to zero
see if you can put that together to try
to answer the question what does T of a
equal from these set of choices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
