before that works correctly except for
with this assumption that all months
have 30 days so the first step is going
to be to define a stub procedure days
and months that gives the number of days
in a month but for our stub procedure
we're just going to always return 30 and
I'm gonna modify next day to call days
and month that's pretty simple but I
should start testing and I'm gonna write
some code to do testing we don't want to
have to keep typing the same test cases
in the shell we want to write some code
for testing for the problem is provided
there were some provided test cases I'm
gonna write my own starting now and I'm
gonna make sure that now these test
cases we don't expect the correct result
yet because I'm testing with 30-day
months so I'm gonna test two dates that
are the same it's a boundary case it's a
useful one the test I'm gonna test from
one day to the next that should give us
one day and these are test cases four
days between dates I should really be
writing some test cases for next day the
reason for that is that if they fail
well it's gonna be more easy to
understand what went wrong rather than
just writing all my test cases for days
between dates so let's try some next day
test cases I've got one where the day
advances let's get one where the month
advances and I will use a month that has
30 days so it will be correct in 38
months but will still be correct once we
fix this and I'll use advancing the year
a few test cases probably we should have
more but let's try that we should save
and let's run this and we'll run our
test and something failed not too
surprising this happens let's see what
failed and the failure is a type error
that I'm calling days and months not
passing in the right number of
parameters in fact I passed in zero I
should have passed in both the year and
the month so this is one of the reasons
for writing things in stubs we can find
these kinds of errors quickly so let's
try again and now our test passed and
our test case is using assertions I'm
gonna be a little more careful and print
something out when the test finishes
because it's a little bit dangerous to
have nothing tell us when the tests
finish maybe we didn't get any up up for
some other reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
