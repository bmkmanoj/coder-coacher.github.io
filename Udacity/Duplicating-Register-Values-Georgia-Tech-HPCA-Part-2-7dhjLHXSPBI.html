false dependencies is to duplicate
register values let's see how that would
work we have an instruction here that
adds R 2 and R 3 and puts the result in
R 1 then we have R 1 minus R 5 goes into
our 4 then we have our 4 plus 1 goes
into our 3 then we have R 8 minus R 9
goes into R 4 and some time later we
have an instruction that uses our four
here we have what happens in some cycle
let's call it cycle 100 and in the next
few cycles and let's assume that cycle
100 is when this instruction can execute
now what happens is after we execute
this instruction it can supply the
register value r1 to forwarding to the
next instruction so we have that this
instruction can execute here and then R
4 can be supplied to the next
instruction so it can execute here
however this instruction which is doing
RA 8 minus or 9 could actually execute
here so the problem with false
dependencies occurs in that r4 is
written by this and also this
instruction so let's see which final
value of R 4 ends up in the register so
that it is used much later here well if
this is in execution stage let's say
that we have the memory stage next and
the write register stage next meanwhile
this instruction goes through the mem
stage here and then write register here
so as you can see we first write this R
4 and only then write this R 4 which
means that the final value of register R
4 and that is the value that will be
read by this instruction is actually
going to come from this instruction and
that should not be happening so in order
to fix this one way is to again
duplicate register values so the idea is
that when this instruction writes to the
register R 4 it writes to a version of
register R 4 and then another value is
stored to another version of our 4 but
we remember
version so that's why it's called
duplication pretty much we don't store
only one value for our four we store all
the possible values that are for head
and then an instruction that once are
four we'll have to search among all the
possible versions of our four to find
the one that is before it but the latest
one before it so in this case we will
search for our four and find this one
and this one and this is the latest one
that we should be using that requires
two versions of our four to exist
meanwhile this instruction here when it
executes will look for versions of our
four and again find that there are
really two versions that it might be
using our four here and our four here
but because this one is coming after
this instruction it should be ignored
and thus we use this value so everything
will be correct but it requires us to
keep multiple versions of each registers
which is really complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
