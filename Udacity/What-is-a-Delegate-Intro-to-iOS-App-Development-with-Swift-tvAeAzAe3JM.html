students is that the word delegate makes
them think of the relationship between a
boss and an employee perhaps you've been
in a situation where your boss has
delegated some work to you or given you
some work
the idea of delegating work is similar
in iOS here you can think of av audio
recorder like a boss it knows how to
record audio it also knows when the
recording is done and is ready for
playback in fact if you look deep enough
in the code for av audio recorder you'll
find a function called audio recorder
did finish recording this is the
function that gets called when the
recording has finished now honestly this
seems like a method we could use in our
class record sounds view controller
remember the situation where our user
would record a 5-minute long
conversation with a friend on our app if
somehow we had access to this method it
could tell us exactly when the audio was
recorded successfully so then we could
do things with that audio for instance
play it back so then why doesn't a V
audio recorder just tell our class that
hey audio has been recorded successfully
well one reason for that is that we
wrote our class today and this class av
audio recorder was written by an Apple
engineer years ago at the time they
wrote this class they had no idea we
would be writing our class and that we
would call it record sounds view
controller one way Apple decided to
overcome this problem was by delegating
the implementation of methods like this
to classes like ours our class record
sounds view controller can take
advantage of this method if we become a
delegate of av audio recorder so to make
this boss employee or delegate
relationship work in our code we have to
do two things the first thing we have to
do is to change the definition of record
sounds view controller by adding this
thing av audio recorder delegate to it
the second thing we have to do is
somewhere in our class we have to write
this line of code audio recorder
delegate equal to self self here means a
record sounds view controller and what
this statement is saying is that record
sounds view controller is now the
delegate of audio recorder after we have
done these two things we can then
implement the function audio recorder
did finish recording inside our class so
in the next video we will add these two
things to our code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
