for focused behavior because they're
automatically inserted into the tab
order based on their position in the Dom
to give you an example I've written a
little bit of HTML here I've got three
button elements and then you can see the
output over here on the right so there's
three button elements rendering inside
of my browser now because the tab order
corresponds to the Dom order when I go
and press the tab key you'll see that
the first button element gets the focus
indicator around it and as I keep
pressing tab you'll see the next item in
the Dom order gets focused and tab again
now the last item in the Dom water is
focused now it's important to note that
using something like CSS it's possible
to have things appear in one order on
screen but actually exists in a
different order over in the Dom to give
me an example of that what I've done now
is I've just added this inline style to
my first button element and I'm telling
it that I want it to float to the right
now what this is going to do is it's
going to visually change the ordering of
these buttons here such that our first
Dom element is now appearing last on
screen visually so even though the
visual order has changed the Dom order
remains the same let's see how that
affects tabbing when I press the tab key
the first Dom element is still focused
but now visually it's the last element
in this group which is kind of weird if
I press tab again now we see that the
second Dom element which is the first
visual element becomes focused and
pressing tab again I've got this middle
element now being focused even though
that's the last dumb item so the moral
of this story is be careful when you're
using something like CSS to visually
change the position of your elements on
screen this can cause the tab order to
jump around seemingly at random and for
users relying on a keyboard this can be
extremely confusing for this reason the
webbing checklist specifically States in
section 132 that the reading and
navigation order as determined by code
order should be logical and intuitive
in your application that's just sort of
a general rule of thumb i like to tab
through my page every so often just to
make sure i haven't accidentally messed
up the tab order it's a good habit to
adopt and it's one that doesn't really
require a ton of effort on my part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
