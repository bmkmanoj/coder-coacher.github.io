a language that we want to be able to
execute using computers we want to be
able to create programs that we can
actually run it's also a language that
we use to describe programs that's the
main thing we want to express with the
programming language it's designed to be
easy for humans to write and for
computers to execute it's also designed
to be read by humans they're written by
computers is a little tricky we haven't
talked about that yet but many programs
are written by other programs and we've
seen our first example of that that the
Python interpreter takes as input a
program and runs that program and
finally it's a language that's designed
to be read and written by humans and
executed by computers and this is really
the best answer that we want the
programs that we write to be things that
we can use to show to other humans to
understand the process to be able to
understand what's going on we also want
to be able to execute those programs by
computers so this is one of the
challenges in designing a good
programming language that in order to be
easy for humans to read and write it
that makes it harder for computers to
executed and one of the nice things
about Python is it works well for both
of these properties that it is designed
to be easy for humans to read and write
and with the Python interpreter it
executes swell on computers it doesn't
execute as quickly as some other
languages that are less focused on being
easy for humans to read and write but
certainly for a first language to learn
about programming it's an excellent
choice and focusing on being easy for
humans to read and write is a lot more
important than making it easy for
computers to execute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
