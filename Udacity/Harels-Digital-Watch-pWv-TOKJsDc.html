her L came and gave a talk and as in the
paper in the talk he talked about his
digital watch and he presented a model
of the digital watch he in fact had used
that as a way of stressing his
diagramming technique to see if it was
capable of representing the features of
the of the digital watch from the paper
here's here's the example of the digital
watch from a high-level view notice that
there are really two states here one is
the dead state and one is the alive
state separated by whether the battery
is placed inside or so on and then there
are five concurrently executing sub
machines inside the alive state each of
which has their own activities going
going on and there's even further
nesting down in the lower right hand
concurrent machine the fact that state
charts support nesting means you can
pull out any of these sub machines and
consider them independently you can even
provide details in the pulled out
version that weren't visible in the top
level version here's an example of the
stopwatch state it's makes use of a
history state you'll notice there it had
his own default state for the for the
stopwatch itself in the zero step
there's also guarded transition using
the in keyword that I mentioned before
here's a pull out on the display state
notice that the state itself has a self
transition over on the left that
indicates that there's a two-minute
timer what this is saying is if you were
in one of the displaced states other
than the default state after two minutes
you will it will flip back unless you
were in the stopwatch state in which
case it'll keep keep you looking at the
stopwatch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
