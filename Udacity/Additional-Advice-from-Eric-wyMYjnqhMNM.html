for Android position I think it's
important to have and spend some effort
in putting together a portfolio of what
you built a lot of times people just
like refer you to their github account
and they'll have a ton of repose none of
them have been touched or they're not
like complete so I think when you
structure it structured maybe if you can
build a portfolio page of apps that
you've developed in your github page
think of them the same way so put in
screenshots not everyone's going to
build your apps but people are going to
look at your code so put in some
description of in the readme that people
can see initially of what the app does
what it was targeted why you built it I
think those are all important things
because when i get a developer one of
the first things i do after after i
talked to them or even before hand is
look at their github page and look at
our code because i think i give you a
sense of they have no restrictions like
this is how they would program on their
own and in the quality of the code they
produce when you're interviewing for a
job you're also looking for a company
that's right fit for you so I think it's
important like and depending on the
company they might be willing or how
willing to do it but getting a sense of
the culture is important and also if you
can getting a sense of the code base if
you can look at the code and kind of see
how developers are developing within
that company and if you think it's
something where it looks promising and
that you could learn a great deal from
you should definitely go into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
