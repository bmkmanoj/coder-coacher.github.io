and like I said we're gonna be given
some training let examples and we want
to predict the labels okay I need a
little bit of invitations because we're
gonna do a trivial amount of math this
little notation for 29 means an object
is really a 4 but I call it a night
we're going to talk about the costs or
the loss you're gonna see L for loss you
know what's the cost to me of calling a
four and nine or calling a nine of for
all right and one of the things we're
going to assume for the rest of today
and it's really not a big deal you can
factor this internet we're going to
assume the cost of calling an X and X 0
okay so nobody gets upset if I call a
spade a spade so to speak so let's
consider the to class binary
classification problem member we just
had fours and nine so we have two kinds
of losses alright so that's what this L
means and L of 49 is the loss of
classifying a 4 as a nine and conversely
L of 924 is the loss of classifying a 9
as a four okay pretty straightforward
risk is your expected cost ok so if I've
got a particular strategy s classifier
strategy s we want to talk about what's
the expected loss alright and for our 49
example the risk of our strategy is
what's the probability that i'll call a4
a9 how often is that going to happen ok
using this particular strategy and i
multiply that by whatever the loss is
the cost of calling a 49 and what's the
probability of calling a 9 of 4 and
what's the loss when i call a 9 of for
all right and that's the risk and the
probability is you know fifteen percent
of the time that I'm running this thing
fifteen percent of times I'm gonna for
is going to come up and I'm going to
call it a nine okay that's what
probability of calling for nine means so
this total quantity that's what's
referred to as your risk and remember
what we want to do is we want to
minimize the expected risk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
