two of the most commonly used methods in
psychological science correlational and
experimental designs in correlational
studies two variables are studied such
as the amount of housework and the
number of sexual encounters as it turns
out these two things were related but
remember that correlations tell us only
about the strength and direction of the
relationship not whether one causes the
other in experimental studies if done
correctly can shed light on whether one
variable causes another but true
experiments have to have two conditions
met first random assignment of
participants to either a control or an
experimental condition and if these two
conditions are treated exactly the same
except the experimental group gets the
treatment or the predicted cause whereas
the control group does not and serves as
a baseline comparison by giving two
groups different amounts of something
we're manipulating a variable and this
leads to the second condition of an
experiment so the second condition of an
experiment is manipulation of an
independent variable and an independent
variable remember is something that the
investigator manipulates so for instance
the amount of caffeine given experiment
also has a dependent variable or an
outcome variable in this case could be
reaction time so if the amount of
caffeine really does have an effect we
can say that our independent variable or
caffeine is the cause and the dependent
variable or reaction time is the effect
and it depends upon the independent
variable so psychological scientists use
these and many other kinds of research
methods but the key is that psychology
makes use of the scientific method to
answer questions about human nature
human thought and human behavior so
psychological scientists can't do
whatever they want in their research
they have to do what's ethical and their
proposals always have to be approved by
an ethics board or an IRB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
