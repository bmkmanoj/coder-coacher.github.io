asked to list their race performed well
and as for the students who were asked
to list their race they found that
african-american students became really
anxious and performed poorly on their
tests this is what we meant earlier
about stereotypes possibly perpetuating
themselves here we see that stereotypes
can influence an individual to behave in
a way that confirms the stereotype so
why is this important well think of a
stereotype such as girls don't do well
in math or science or men aren't
emotionally aware if you're in one of
these categories for example a girl and
you're aware of the stereotype it can
actually influence your overall
performance this is quite fascinating
and important to be aware of because the
stereotype girls are not good at math
might prevent girls from going into a
field that's heavy in math or even may
cause individual girls to perform poorly
on math exams can you think of any
stereotype groups that you may belong to
and how this could possibly affect your
performance on different tasks this is a
great topic for the discussion forums
however it's a sensitive topic so please
be respectful now let's go to Susan who
has an example for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
