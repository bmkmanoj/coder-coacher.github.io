this one is kind of tricky because now
we're subtracting some of the terms and
adding some of the terms especially if
you're going to be rearranging terms
before combining them it might be
helpful to think of this kind of problem
as adding positive and negative terms so
we can rewrite the expression as x
squared plus 3x plus negative 9 plus
negative 3x plus 5 now this will be a
little easier to rearrange we can see
that 3x and negative 3x are like terms
and they can be written next to each
other and negative 9 and 5 are also like
terms so they can be written next to
each other too and then x squared can
just stay as it is because it doesn't
have any other like terms and what we're
left with is 3x plus negative 3x plus
negative 9 plus 5 plus x squared
combining 3 x and negative 3x we get 0 X
and then 0 times anything is 0 so really
that's just 0 and then combining
negative 9 and 5 we get negative 4 keep
our addition sign and then bring down
the x squared because that doesn't have
anything to combine with we shouldn't
include a 0 and so we should rewrite
this as negative 4 plus x squared or it
can be written as x squared minus 4 if
we don't want a negative in front note
that in a simplified expression we don't
include zeroes whether we're adding a
zero subtracting a zero or multiplying
by zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
