accurately fill on this concept map here
in lesson 4 we learned that the human
genome can be divided between the
non-coding DNA and the protein coding
DNA the non-coding DNA represents about
ninety-eight percent of our genome
where's protein coding DNA represents
about two percent no matter how you
divide it you've got two copies of the
human genome in every cell now
non-coding DNA includes three main types
of non-coding sequence that we discussed
one type was a promoter another type was
an enhancer now enhancers are bound by
activators so that's how we knew
enhancers went here instead of here we
know that if it promoters and enhancers
are two of the types then the third type
silencers silencers are bound by
repressors and activators and repressors
are types of transcription factors
transcription factors specifically bind
around the Tata sequence which is
essential to drive initiation of
transcription via the promoter so
everything in this lesson really centers
around the promoter sequence because the
promoter is the main effective
non-coding DNA region that regulates
transcription of a protein coding gene
now transcription factors generally are
proteins that bind any regulatory region
of DNA activators and repressors are
very specific types that bind certain
regions like enhancers that promote
transcription initiation via promoters
and repressors that bind silencers which
silence or inhibit transcription from a
promoter region but no matter what
promoters sit in front of protein coding
genes which are essentially the
divisions of protein coding DNA here now
our transcription factors that bind
regulatory regions of DNA thus regulate
the expression of protein coding DNA or
genes we also learn very specifically
that just like in lesson 3 that
different sequences of protein coding
DNA can be called alleles the same is
true for non-coding DNA we can have
different sequences called alleles
and are these all originated from
mutations which we'll learn about more
in less than six overall in the human
genome both protein coding DNA even
though it represents only about two
percent or less and non-coding DNA which
represents the vast majority of our
genome they work together to specify
thousands of different cell types and
together these are organized by the
process of development that makes us who
we are all of our complexity all of our
trades</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
