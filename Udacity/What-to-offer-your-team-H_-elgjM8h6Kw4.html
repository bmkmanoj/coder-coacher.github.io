can do in the early days trying to get
people to come work for you is beg
really well and you know some truth to
that really but the thing you can offer
people at that stage of a company is
impact and vision and passion and that
they can't get anywhere else I mean sure
you need to set up incentives and
compensation so that it makes sense
they're going to make a sacrifice
joining you early in this journey almost
certainly right there's some opportunity
costs for you there's some opportunity
costs for your early employees and that
could last year's so you want to set up
incentives in such a way the
compensation in such a way that it's
fair and equitable and equity but the
thing that you really offer them you
can't I mean everybody offers equity and
it's worth the paper it's printed on
literally what you can really sell
people on and really get people excited
about is the impact they'll have and the
vision that you have and the product
itself and the changes that you can make
even if it's just a you know it doesn't
have to be a world-changing product but
the ability people want to have an
impact the kind of people you want to
hire desperately want to have an impact
and that's what you can give them that
they can't they go to a larger company
that impact isn't necessarily diminished
and so I always talk more about the
impact and the learning and the roles
and that you know the the fact that they
will be making more decisions than
they'll probably make it any other time
in their life and the right people for
those early hires will just gravitate
towards that and the sort of
compensation and dealing with the the
sort of sacrifice that they're making
the opportunity cost that they're
incurring is just details just get them
excited about the impact that they can
have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
