concept of a pennant so what's that
here's a formal definition a pennant is
a tree with 2 to the K nodes and a unary
root and that route has a child and the
child is the root of a complete binary
sub tree okay that was a lot of words
here's a picture this pennant has a root
and one child and notice that the child
is a parent of a complete binary sub
tree now pennant has to have a power of
two number of nodes now remember that a
complete binary tree has to have almost
a power of two number of nodes in
particular two to the K minus 1 and
therefore when we add the route we get a
power of two ok now let's see how we can
quickly do interesting operations on
penance let's call the root little X and
let's call its complete binary subtree
child capital X sub s now suppose I give
you a second pennant this pennant has a
root node little Y and a child subtree
Capital y sub s and let's further
suppose if these pennants have exactly
the same size even though I haven't
really drawn them to scale so how do you
quickly combine these two pennants into
a new pennant here's one way let's
choose one of the roots to be the new
root of the combined pennant let's pick
X for example so let's chop X off and
let's make it the root of the new
pennant let's take the other route and
let's make it the new only child of X so
that X is unary now since we have to
complete sub trees left and the sub
trees are both exactly the same size I
can make them both children of Y and
together they'll still be a complete
binary sub tree now notice that this new
blob is still a pennant it's got a unary
root and it's got a complete binary sub
tree now both are the original pendants
were size 2 to the K so that means the
combined pennant will have 2 to the k
plus 2 to the K or 2 to the k plus 1
nodes so combining two equal-sized
pennants into a new pennant is pretty
quick and easy similarly you can split a
pennant into two smaller pennants and
it'll be just as easy essentially by
running the same steps in reverse and
rearranging pointers accordingly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
