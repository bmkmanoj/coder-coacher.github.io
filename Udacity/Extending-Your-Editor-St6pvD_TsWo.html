is like that steak knife that was built
to fulfill a specific purpose well that
wasn't the entire truth it's true that
most editors have figured out how to do
a great job with basic editing but
almost all modern editors can be
extended with functionality in sublimes
case all of it comes from a healthy
community of developers like you that
were missing something and build it and
indeed right now your sublime is a
generic text editor it doesn't care
about you being a web developer the next
step you customize it with the help of
James so it becomes up front end
development editor sublime doesn't have
a built-in plug-in repository so the
first thing we'll need to do is install
package control it's the only town will
need to manually install a plug-in will
take the scary-looking block attacks
from the notes and paste it into
sublimes terminal and with that it's
fetching the plug-in and installing all
of the dependencies let's test whether
it worked type command shift p to bring
up sublimes command palette this
drop-down menu is useful in many ways
because it contains all the actions
sublime can do I generally use it to
discover stuff I didn't know about like
this toggle comment action and to
execute actions that don't have
shortcuts or have crazy long ones but
right now type in PA c and you'll see
many new commands associated with
package control the one we really care
about is install package this one right
here this is the list of all the
packages in the repository so now that
we're prepared let's install a few of
our favorite plugins this list of
plugins is also in the notes for you to
quickly copy and paste through package
controls install command please install
Emmet sidebar enhancements color picker
and color highlighter some plugins
require restarting the editor so to make
sure do that after you've installed
everything Emmet dramatically extend and
improve Sublime's built-ins hex nip
'it's its craziest feature is the
ability to use CSS selectors to create
new HTML markup and no that sounds a bit
confusing but let me tell you what I
mean
let's say I need a list with four items
in my index.html file I can do that by
typing the cs selector shown here then
pressing tab expands the selector into
the HTML be specified em it comes with a
lot more built-in magic that you should
definitely check out in the link in the
instructors notes the sidebar
enhancements plugin has a pretty
descriptive and spot-on name it mostly
extends the right-click menu of sublimes
usually pretty bare-bones sidebar with
all the stuff you would expect the
leading files new folders and so on but
also some nifty stuff such as copying
content as a data URI now these last two
color picker and color highlighter work
together to make editing and working
with colors and CSS much easier pressing
command shift C opens the system color
picker and allows you to quickly choose
a color and when the cursor is placed in
or around an existing color picking a
new one will update it the highlighter
outlines or underlines colors it finds
in your CSS with a preview so you always
have an idea what you're looking at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
