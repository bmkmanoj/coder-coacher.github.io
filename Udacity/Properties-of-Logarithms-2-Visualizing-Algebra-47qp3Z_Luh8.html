log base B of 5 great work if you got
this right again I think it's best to
think about splitting this up into two
logarithms log base B of five and log
base B of five we're adding three
logarithms together right here so we can
really just multiply these arguments
together so we'll have log base B of 3
times 5 times 5 that's how we can
combine these three logarithms through
addition and then we'll have minus log
base B of 15 on the end and finally to
subtract two logarithms with the same
base will divide the second one into the
first one so we'll have log base B of 3
times 5 times 5 / 15 we have the factors
of 15 which reduced to 1 which leaves us
with log base B of five now there was
one other way that we could have solved
this problem and it involves using the
power rule let's see what that would
look like we could have started by
moving this to back up as an exponent
for the five so two times log base B of
five would equal log base B of five
squared now we can apply the same rules
for adding logarithms with the same base
and subtracting logarithms with the same
base when we add these two logarithms
together we'll have log base B of three
times five squared we simply multiply
these two numbers together and finally
here we'll divide this number into this
number so to combine these logarithms
when subtracting will have log base B of
three times five squared divided by 15
notice that 5 squared is the same thing
as 5 times 5 so we're really back to
what we ended with last time our factor
of fifteen simplifies to 1 so we're left
with log base B of 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
