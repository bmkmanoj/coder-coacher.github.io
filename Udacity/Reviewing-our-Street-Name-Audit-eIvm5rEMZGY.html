having iterated through the entire data
set millions and millions of tags okay
then what I'm going to do is print out
the data that I found for my audit okay
so it actually takes a little while for
that to run so I've run it already okay
and here's what the output looks like
okay so there actually aren't really
that many unusual values what I find is
so in the United States and this is
going to vary from one country to
another in the United States we number
certain types of road so this would be a
US highway United States highway the
same thing with 53 59 and so on all
right so that's why I'm seeing these as
keys all right now this is odd my guess
is these look like zip codes to me your
postal codes all right another Road
number okay and then I'm seeing
different forms of Avenue all right and
as I move through this okay so here's a
good example of a set for this
particular key value here for Court okay
so these are all of the different uses
of CT as an abbreviation for court in
this particular data set okay and as I
scroll through this I see the rest of
the unusual Street types okay now what I
have to decide and basically this is the
process that you're going to follow
through the next few exercises is which
of these are okay and which of them do I
need to do something about South Avenue
well that's actually a correct way of
representing a street name there's
nothing wrong with that it's just that
it wasn't expected in my audit it's ok
though I would probably not want to do
anything to change how this is
represented on the other hand I don't
really like all caps abbreviations so I
would probably transform all of the
abbreviations into the specific word
that that represents so for example pkwy
is an abbreviation for Parkway ok so
that's what I would probably use they're
all right and the same with other
abbreviations that we find here Street
terrace and so on okay so your general
process for the exercises that follow is
going to be to write some code to audit
the data and then decide
what type of fixes you want to apply to
that data and then write the code that
actually performs the fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
