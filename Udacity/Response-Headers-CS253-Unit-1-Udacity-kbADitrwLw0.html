and just like the request the status
line is followed by a number of headers
I'll give you a few examples here are
some headers that are commonly included
of HTTP responses now just like the
client requests the headers that you see
aren't always the same some of them are
required and when I say required I mean
usually they're but the web has evolved
organically over time so many of the
headers that are you know required are
you know often not there or things will
work without them but anyway okay so
date is there all the time that's when
the request happens you know no surprise
there server this is similar to the user
agent header on the request this is the
generally the name and version number of
the server that's handling the response
now personally I try to never include
this or if I do include it I make
something up because otherwise you're
just giving free information to you know
a would be it would be hacker who wants
to know you know what's vulnerabilities
work against you content type very
popular this is the type of document
that's being returned this is so your
browser knows how to display it so text
hTML is a common one obviously you know
that that's what an HTML page would be
you could see image PNG or you know
image gif you know if it's an image that
sort of thing in content length is how
long the document that follows is
contact length is often included but
it's not strictly required because the
browser will know when the documents
done receiving data because the
connection may close most all the ways
of also in you know telling the browser
that I'm done sending data but it's not
super relevant right this second we've
discussed the basic requests and
responses let's let's play around on a
terminal a little bit and you know it
practice with these a bit okay so open
up a terminal if that is not
straightforward on your machine we'll
have some class notes on on how to do
that
you Windows users might have some
challenges in front of you so we're in
our terminal and we're going to use a
program called telnet to make some
Internet requests to web servers and
watch the HTTP go by so we can see it in
practice okay so let's make a request
okay I'm making a request to Udacity
comm
80 this is the request your browser will
be making if you were loading Udacity
calm in it we connected UIC comm port 80
which if you recall 80 is the default
okay so I'll hit enter we connect and
now I'm going to send the request line
that we've talked about before now I'm
going to send an HTTP 1.0 and I'll
explain why in a second and I'm gonna
include the host header Google wants
this because as we discussed before it's
hosting a lot of different web servers
on that machine
now let's scroll back up to the top of
this you can see the request we made get
slash HTTP 1.0 hosts Udacity comm know
why did i do 1.0 because the default
behavior and 1.1 is 2 is for the server
to not close the connection to allow the
browser to make multiple requests for
multiple things which is an optimization
but when you're testing by hand it means
the connection stays open and then you
have to close the connection on your
machine which is you know when you're
using telnet is sometimes a little bit
of a pain so we see our response or our
request 1.0 hosts Udacity calm and then
you see the response from the server
here's the status line HTTP 1.0 200 ok
so that means it worked and now you can
see a bunch of headers some of these
headers we've we've seen and discussed
before
here's date here is the server it's
Google front-end here is the content
type text HTML that means we're
receiving HTML which is no big surprise
and if we scroll down following the
status line on the headers we see the
actual response document and this is
HTML this is this type of stuff we were
working on before this is complex but
you get the idea lots of HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
