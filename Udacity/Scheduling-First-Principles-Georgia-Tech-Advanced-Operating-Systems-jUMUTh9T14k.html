synchronization and communication issues
in parallel systems the next part of the
lesson will cover scheduling issues in
parallel systems you'll notice once
again when we discuss scheduling issues
that the mantra is always the same
namely pay attention to keeping the
caches warm to ensure good performance
we're going to look at scheduling issues
in parallel systems fundamentally the
typical behavior of any thread or a
process running on a processor if you do
the following compute for a while and
then make a blocking i/o system call or
it might want to synchronize with other
threads that it is part of in the
application or it might be that it is a
compute bound thread in which case it
might just run out of the time quantum
that it has been given by the scheduler
on the processor but fundamentally what
that means is this is a point at which
the operating system in particular the
scheduler piece of the operating system
can schedule some other thread or a
process to run on the CPU so how should
the scheduler go about picking the next
thread or a process to run on the
processor given that it as a choice of
other threads that it can run at any
point of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
