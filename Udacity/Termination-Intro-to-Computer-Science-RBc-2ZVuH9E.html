to determine whether they terminate for
all inputs which are natural numbers 1 2
3 4 and so on when we have a while loop
and its condition is true that's always
going to mean that the block underneath
is performed so the loop will just keep
going and going and going it will never
fail at the condition so the only way
this will terminate is if something
within the block causes it to terminate
and we see we have a break here now what
we have to determine is where that break
is always reached here we have N equals
n minus 1 and when n is a whole number
it just steps down one step at a time
each time it goes through the while loop
and eventually it will reach zero so
this condition here will succeed and the
break will be reached for all natural
numbers N and the procedure will return
three so for this one it does terminate
for inputs and for procedure to we can
give an example when N equals 4 let's
see what happens is then equal to 0 no
it's not so we return 1 plus the
procedure four minus two which is too so
then we look to see if we put two in
here fan then no n isn't zero we return
1 plus the procedure of 2 minus 2 which
is zero and call it again with zero and
is 0 so it returns zero so that works ok
but what happens if N equals 5 when we
get here n minus two is three so we call
the procedure again with N equals three
and it's not zero so we come to here
again this time we have n is 3 3 minus 2
is one call the procedure again with n
is 1 and is not zero and we come to hear
again and we call the procedure with n
minus 2 which is one minus 2 which is
minus 1 with Miss Sarah
and we're never going to get to zero
because we're always decreasing n so
this procedure will not terminate for
some men and in fact it won't terminate
for any of the odd numbers so for the
final procedure will this terminate we
put in the value of that and we call it
again we can see that we're decreasing n
x 1 x 2 and x 3 for large n we don't
need to think about it but what happens
when we get near the base case are we
going to always be able to terminate or
not so if input is 6 we're going to get
five four and three so the three will be
okay then on the next round when we have
five if we input five we'd have four
three and two well that would be ok
because two will be less than or equal
to 3 if n is for then we're going to
have three and two and one and that's ok
all of these are small enough and so
when and gets small we don't have a
problem because of the less than or
equals which means this is going to
terminate for all natural numbers n as
well so the correct answer is that
procedure one will terminate procedure
to will not terminate for all N and
procedure three will terminate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
