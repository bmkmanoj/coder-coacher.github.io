work together we can only shift if the
next input token and the one we're
currently looking at exactly matches see
the next thing we expect to see now you
might have been tempted to have an AI
plus one in here but remember that in
Python lists and strings are indexed
from zero so tokens bracket zero is
actually the first element of the input
so one of the first things we have to do
is check and see is CD empty or is it
something well if CD is not empty then
we can take a look at its first element
C and we'll just check to see how that
compares two tokens I if they match
exactly then we can shift over that
token so we're going to return a new
parsing state that still has X at the
front but now instead of a B it should
have a B C because we're shifting the
red dot one remember that see was the
zeroth element of CD we've shifted the
red dot over one and now instead of CD
on the right it's just going to have D
on the right we want to peel off the
first element of this list we can use
pythons range selection to peel off all
but the zeroth element let me just make
my writing a bit more clear there this
was really from Jay and we are also from
J if the stars did not align either if
CD was empty or if it didn't match up
the next token then we were supposed to
return none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
