remember the homework scores classroom
before here's a slightly modified
version of it we had it collect all of
the scores so that we could do
computations with them later but if all
that we want is to add all of the scores
in and calculate the total without the
lowest one we don't need to collect all
of the scores so here's the outline of
what we want to build a homework scores
class with an ADD score method and to
get total excluding lowest method the
only method that should be a mutator is
the ADD score method in earlier lessons
we had a method for removing the minimum
score but in this version we won't
remove any we'll just find a way to not
count them when we're calculating the
total there are a few corner cases I'd
like you to think about that have
special behavior if there are no scores
yet say that the total is zero if
there's one score say the total is that
score if there are more say the total is
the total excluding the lowest now
remember I'd like you to do this without
collecting all of the scores in an
ArrayList or an array try this yourself
and if you'd like a hint
there'll be hint links over here they'll
show you more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
