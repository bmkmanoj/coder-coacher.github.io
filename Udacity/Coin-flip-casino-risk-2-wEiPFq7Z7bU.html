this thought experiment is to consider
the standard deviation of all those
individual bets so again consider we
have a thousand different betting tables
out there and we have the opportunity to
allocate our bets however you like you
know we could put 200 tokens on one
table 5 on another and so on we're
looking at the two extreme cases here of
course but in any case what is the
standard deviation of the results of all
those individual bets so we're going to
look at standard deviation after the
fact in other words we're going to
assume we bet already and we're looking
at the outcome so if we have one token
per table we might have a loss of one
toke on one table again on another
another loss and again and again and so
on all the way across our 1,000 tables
now we don't actually have to spend much
time doing the math here but it turns
out that the standard deviation for this
case is pretty easy to calculate because
for each table the result is either
negative 1 or 1 and it turns out that
the standard deviation in this case is
easily calculated as 1 point 0 so it
doesn't matter what the particular
outcome turns out to be we know we're
either going to lose one or gain one in
every single table and so our spected
standard deviation there is one the
outcome for the second scenario where we
make one bet with a thousand tokens and
then essentially zero bets on the other
tables turns out a little bit
differently so on this first table where
we bet 1,000 tokens we either win a
thousand or we lose one thousand and on
all the other tables the outcome is
exactly zero same for this case where we
lost on that first one so again we bet
on one table a thousand tokens and we
bet zero tokens on the other 999
reasoning it out this way enables us to
calculate the standard deviation
whichever way it goes whether we win or
lose the standard deviation on this
event is the same and the answer is 31.6
to key point here is standard deviation
or risk is much much larger well as you
can
about 31 times larger when we make that
single bed on one table and no bets on
the other tables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
