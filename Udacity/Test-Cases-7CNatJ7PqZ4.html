a nun object and maybe even an empty
matrix is that right right hmm so we
have our regular matrix that we're
taking in but it contain zeros and ones
nothing else right that's true so this
is also another input we can have so
here he started thanking through testing
edge cases for inputs into the algorithm
as you may have noticed when he was
creating edge cases he thought of the
possible weird inputs that he would have
to handle right if there were other
values that could have been used in his
matrix he would have to account for
those it's always a good idea to think
about how your code handles null and
empty inputs since not addressing them
could cause your code to crash you
notice is great about this stuff in the
approach is I have a feeling it might
help in future steps let's see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
