be asking as you're outside the building
now talking to customers is competition
competition kind of exists outside the
business model canvas
think of the canvas now floating in a
world where other people's business
model canvases that are floating as well
and so just kind of take a step back and
go well who else is out there and what
are they doing the next thing you want
to be asking again outside the canvas
why is this problem so hard to solve or
why is this service not being done by
other people it might be that hopefully
you really do have a insight or
breakthrough where it might be you're
hallucinating
and so if you really do need to keep
asking that question not on it to
yourself
go ask it to the people you're talking
to ask them has anybody done this and
I'm thinking you know we've never seen
it ask them why why do you think you
might get some insight like oh yeah
there have been nine vendors in the last
you know three and a half years who
tried this and they all failed warning
you might want to investigate why that
happened hopefully you have a different
approach or a different insight than
anybody else and as we kept talking
about earlier market size we're gonna be
talking about how to size the market at
the end of this lecture but you really
do want to understand how big is this
problem and is this what we want to
spend our next couple years doing and
then finally as we said how do you do it
once you understand the customer needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
