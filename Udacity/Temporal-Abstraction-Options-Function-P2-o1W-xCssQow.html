I've drawn is an MVP and a particular
trajectory through that MVP so here the
dots are States and the little lines are
sort of the actions that you took to
move between those states and whatever
rewards you happen to pick up along the
way so I'm in some MVP a Markov decision
process and I am moving through States
taking actions and receiving rewards and
I'm sort of moving through that and
that's kind of what we've been thinking
about before right this is what the
bellman equation sort of captures for us
we're going to be in a state take an
action and up in the next state maybe
getting rewards I should accumulate all
that and use that to update my estimate
of the value of being in a particular
state right then I look at something
there that is a diagram of Saur Saur
Saur Saur Saur all right this is sorry
so special
forever and ever now we know how this
works
one of us probably both of us at some
point or another actually sort of
explained the math behind here and how
you would back up values and why this is
a way to do learning but in this space
where we have these temporal
abstractions we have these options we're
actually violating everything that we
know about mdps and I think it helps
there to draw a slightly different
picture so because we have these
temporal lis abstract options we are not
having very simple time steps right so
here kind of implicit in this is we're
in state we take an action and there in
another state we're in a state we take
an extra another state so on and so
forth and how much time passes between
visiting each of these states Michael
I'm gonna call it one time step one time
step which I'm gonna claim you may not
agree with this my T's will be the same
thing as zero time steps in some sense
we treat the actions in an MDP as if
they are instantaneous and perhaps to
drag on more of the computer science
analogy we treat them as if they are
atomic okay I'm along with you for the
atomic idea I definitely am NOT along
with you and the it takes zero time idea
but I guess I guess zero time in the
sense that there's no I know there's no
crack in it there's no window that
anything else can jump in it and and
that's really the idea of atomic so I
think we agree yeah I think we do agree
I mean you're you're basically we're
picking constants you want to call it
one I want to call it zero we can vote
that but that that's like me saying tea
and effort the same thing zero and one
are not the same thing there with
they're the same thing within a concert
not a multiplicative constant fair
enough
I the the point here is that in some
sense atomic instantaneous what really
is happening here I was in a state I
took an action in another state nothing
else can happen we treat that time step
it may be a year it may be a day but
whatever it is we treat them all as if
they're the same and we're just moving
along in fact we talk about time steps
and implicit I think in the way we've
been talking about time steps so far is
that they're all the same length
whatever they are which is why you can
call them one as opposed to seven it
doesn't really matter the fact is that I
take this there's an atomic action take
and I end up somewhere else nothing else
happens in the middle I can reason about
everything by contrast once we have
these options I mean think about this
this this picture up here think about
the upper the Northeast room if I'm in
this little pink state here I just
entered into the room I'm gonna get from
here the the East door to the South door
in some amount of time right it's going
to be made up of atomic actions because
all I really have is up down left and
right
and I don't know how long that's going
to take let's say it takes 50 time steps
it doesn't really matter it's gonna take
some number time steps but if I'm in
this little space down here near the
bottom already near the door that's
going to take fewer time steps so what
I'm actually seeing with respect to the
underlying MDP is I start in some state
I take one of these options some amount
of time passes often more than the
single time step and then I end up in
another state and then I take another
option and if in another state
take another option I end up in another
state and so on and so forth and the
amount of time that I spend in each
option is variable potentially and it's
not necessarily at the same as the
atomic actions that we have before Oh
interesting ok so variable time steps
right does that mess up everything it
does because if you think about the way
bellmen works is it assumes a discount
that happens at every time step and it
accumulates information along the way so
we need to have a way to capture all of
that that allows us to get all of the
neat little features of an MDP well I'll
still allow
us to use these variable time actions it
turns out that's pretty straightforward
to do I'll just write out the equations
for you and hopefully it'll be easy to
see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
