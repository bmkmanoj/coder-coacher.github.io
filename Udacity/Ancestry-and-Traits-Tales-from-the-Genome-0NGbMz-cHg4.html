grandmother and the reason is because
only the paternal grandmother Cher's the
chromosome segment with the her see to
gene not the maternal grandmother and
the significance behind this is actually
pretty exciting we know that Sheamus
must be homozygous recessive and his
parents Joanna and Heyward must be
heterozygous dominant but he inherited a
her see to gene containing segments of
his chromosome 15 from his paternal
grandmother that means from Susan even
though she had brown eyes she must have
been heterozygous for the her see to
gene which was passed down to hayward
which he then passed down to his son
Sheamus so even though hayward and susan
both had brown eyes his paternal
grandmother was responsible for giving
Sheamus the allele that made his eyes
blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
