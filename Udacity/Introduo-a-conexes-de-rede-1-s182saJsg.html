ordered a hostess right awesome they
look great
looks awesome and dig in here oh wait a
second this doesn't look like a lion
burger and where's my ruddy egg oh yeah
and they kind of got the wrong bun on
mine didn't they dude but did you tell
them what kind of burgers we were no I
just called and said I'd like two
burgers to go please and they said it'd
be ready in 15 minutes
dude really you got to be more specific
I figured they just know we get the same
thing every time maybe I should have
told them who I was when I was ordering
hey you think making an HTTP request is
like ordering a burger at a restaurant
you don't specifically order the
cheeseburger medium rare with a fried
egg that you might get a turkey burger
on sourdough instead yeah HTTP requests
likewise specify explicitly what content
you're looking for and how you'd like it
delivered in this next lesson we'll talk
about how HTTP requests are used to get
the information that we need over the
web HTTP requests are a basic part of
how devices get information from other
computers on the Internet
the idea is you ask for some information
you get a response and then you extract
the information in a way that's useful
every time you visit a page like Google
comm on your computer the web browser
sends an HTTP request to the address
that you entered because received by the
computers on the internet that Google
owns which process the request and
create a response to send back to your
device then the browser on your device
interprets the response and updates the
screen which is the Google home page
that you probably recognize now check
this out I'm give you a little sneak
peek into some neat developer tools in
the chrome web browser feel free to try
this out on your own to access Chrome's
developer tools I'm going to activate a
context menu
that's a right-click usually and choose
inspect now you can see chrome developer
tools has a lot of information about the
page and how it's drawn it's got you
know HTML CSS all this stuff here in the
elements tab but what we want is the
network tab the network tab is going to
show us what loaded to create the web
page there's a lot of different
resources and we'll see HTML CSS
JavaScript and images and that's
thing all getting loaded into the page
at the same time so let me do a refresh
on this page and you can see all these
files just loaded themselves you can
even see the timeline here of how long
it took for each one to load if I scroll
up you can see here's the main Google
com resource that we got with a used a
get method to retrieve the page and the
status response was 200 and it even
tells us the size and how long it took
to retrieve the page and if I resize
this window of that so I can see the
content down here I can even see the
request headers that made up the request
that came from my device and was sent to
the Google servers now the same
communication and transfer happens when
you request data on a mobile device
whether it's the web browser app viewing
a website or any other app using an API
apps can fetch data from some remote
source across the internet such as
computers owned by the USGS alright
let's explore HTTP in a little more
detail when we make an HTTP request
we're basically including very specific
directions and what information we want
from another computer on a network in
the request we include a Uniform
Resource locator or URL which is the
address or location of the data source
that we want the URL tells us that we
need to communicate with computers at
USGS as opposed to the computers at
Google or any other organization a URL
should look pretty familiar to you it's
a string of character as you type into
your web browser whenever you want to
visit a web page like google.com or
audacity com let's take a look at this
example URL the first part is called the
protocol or scheme this is usually going
to be HTTP or HTTPS the next part is
called the host domain or authority
these all pretty much mean the same
thing
the main identity of the web resource
you're connecting to like ooh - ooh comm
or Google comm the next part is the
resource path this is analogous to a
file or folder structure on your
computer or some other hierarchical
organization of information the final
part is called the query the beginning
of the query is indicated by the
question mark the query is an optional
way to include in
information about things you're looking
for like search terms or categories of
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
