webcasts I'm goji I'm John and today
John is going to help us set up grunt
yeah so for those of you don't really
know it grunt is it's a task runner fill
tool it does like all this super awesome
stuff for us and it's going to really
make your workflow just that much faster
it kind of takes care of all the grunt
work time totally intended to it takes
care of all this sort of like mundane
boring things that you kind of have to
do when you're developing front-end code
but don't really want to spend all the
time doing so things like minifying your
files right file size is a big big
problem in web design and you know you
want to get rid of all that white space
and make it as small as possible run
will handle that for you it'll handle
like compiling any sort of special code
you use so if you use any sort of CSS
preprocessors like stats or stylus or if
you use any sort of compiled like
JavaScript language like coffee script
or time script it'll handle all the
compliation of those it'll also you know
concat like your javascript files
together so users don't have to request
a bunch of JavaScript files all at once
they can just set healthspan
optimizations to yes optimizations to
optimize images for you you can even set
up like you're getting workflow with it
so you can you know link it up to github
add some git commands and do it and it
all you can just type in like grunt get
it all you know login push images merge
changes so if you find yourself
basically if you find yourself doing a
repetitive task over and over again in
your front-end development you could
probably get correct to do it for you
okay sorry I feel like there's a lag
might be a little bit of matter we'll
see if that comes up yeah um but yeah so
that that's kind of the cool thing about
direct it just lets you really focus in
on what the most important part what you
should really be focusing on which is
your coding and then you kind of get to
avoid all the sort of boring stuff that
you
really want to do oh but there is a bit
of a learning curve to grunge and I
think a lot of people kind of struggle
with us at first it's actually a really
simple tool once you get a set up and
once you kind of start playing around
with it and so I'm going to pretty much
spend probably the next 30 to 40 minutes
kind of going over how to install grunt
on yours this time you how to set up a
basic rut file and and some other kind
of little cool things you can do in
front 0 and then Greg will come in handy
if our students mon Dieu exceed specs /
project for ya yeah website performance
optimization project and also the
neighborhood project yeah and I mean it
pretty much as a fairly standard tool
grunt or the other popular on this goal
yeah you lay though in many ways i like
you i do like to go better yeah and i
won't dive into the all the reasons why
i like better gretsch still is a very
very popular task runner mmm it's in
fact more popular than gulp still and
it's really easy to use so so how about
we switch over to my screen and and
we'll start talking a little bit about
how to use grunt so um bring the lovely
brain oh yes my awesome woman is very
motivational and now because this
sucking at something is the first step
to being sort of good at something I
think that's like really how I feel that
runt totally sucking courant at first I
used it for like one thing I couldn't
even get it set up the first time I ever
used it and then the more I started
using it the better and better and more
useful a tulip you can yeah so just
something to like you all know that we
posted the github repo that John is
going to work off of yeah so in the
front end broadcast section of the
discussion forum about this event I
included a spill down a little bit a
post there and I don't know why this
opening twice is a grunt work flow guy
and so you can go ahead and clone this
download it as a zip for get whatever
you
want to do this is going to kind of be
the repository that I'm working through
today yeah and the link is also posted
in the description section yes yes and
so in particular the thing you're
probably going to want to look at is the
commits I'm going to be going through so
each of the commits is kind of like a
different step and what we're going to
be doing today and the first commit is
the star commit and if you want your
project to start at this commit I should
have done this before Johnny of the
student would seem love it burns you Oh
awesome i love it I apologize if Tron
I'm not sure how to pronounce comtron
yeah i love this wallpaper so if you
want to start at the beginning as well
after you clone this repo or you
download it as a zip or whatever if you
do get or actually let's let's make this
a little bit easier if you go to the
grunt work flow guide on here and just
hit this little convinced thing and go
to the very first commit here I'm just
making this as easy as possible you can
do it all from the command line using
like get longer okay graph and things
like that but you just copy this commit
number in the top right and you do get
check out and then that commits number
and then natalja don't give us just all
the base base star files but this pretty
much just has to my source directory
which has a j/s and sass holder and in
my J's folder there's just two little
JavaScript files which really don't do
anything fun and one little sass file
that just has one little style in it I
kept things simple so we're not doing a
whole lot but it's easy to just sort of
like expand these ideas to the bigger
topic so let's take a look then at how
do we actually install grant so the
first thing you actually need to do is
you actually move you installed note j/s
so nodejs is a fancy asynchronous i/o
language that
some very very smart people wrote it
basically does a whole bunch of stuff
I'm not going to go into all the details
it's pretty simple to install you just
click the install it's going to download
something on your computer and then you
just run sort of the will install wizard
and it sets itself up pretty well and
it's pretty ok on both yeah so on Mac
it'll basically install itself right
into your user bin folder so you can run
it right from the terminal usually from
the get-go so from here if I type you
know which NPM it tells me which NPM i'm
using on windows i believe it installs a
node shell client like node powershell
and from there you basically just open
up that sort of basher GUI or whatever
they call it i did a while since i've
taken a look at it but you basically
just do all your note work from there
it's just like having a terminal mostly
commands are the same and yeah so that's
the first thing you need is the first
thing you need is no the next thing is i
would always say you know take a look at
the grunt website they have a great sort
of follow along getting started guide
but it may be doesn't explain a lot of
things the most important thing though
that you need to do is you need to
install the command line interface and
you do that pretty simply after you
install node you'll have access to the
node package manager sorry young group
but this is just grunt Jas com yes yes
if you want to open that and so you want
to do NPM install and then you can
choose to not install it globally so
this command here this type and g is
going to install this globally on my
system and then you just type in grunt
CLI and so npm is the node package
manager it's going to handle you know
getting all the files that you need
installing them to the proper
directories and if you guys do run into
any trouble at this step for whatever
reason like ink it says npm
isn't find where you're getting any kind
of errors feel free to post in the
forums I'll be happy to help sort of
debug what's going on it's a little hard
to do over video chat just because it's
kind of different for every user
sometimes your NPM doesn't get installed
correctly or it does get installed but
the system variables aren't set
correctly on your environment so then
you just run this I'm not going to do it
I already have it installed and then
you'll have grunt or the grunt CLI out
easy so now the first thing we want to
do I can actually go back till I know
it's here is in our folder we want to
run mpm in it I'm going to make this a
little bigger so all the files are all
the plugins we're going to be using with
grunge are actually installed through
the node package manager and they're all
know jazz modules so the first thing we
want to do is we want to create what's
called a package.json file which node
basically uses to track our dependencies
it's pretty straightforward if you use
NPM in it it just kind of takes you
through this little walkthrough guide
I'm going to name it that give it that
version my grunt demo it's my
description you probably don't need to
define an entry point or test commands
that's get repository you can give it
some keywords you can find out what all
of these mean just by googling and PM an
it you know to walk through or tutorial
or whatever and you can find a little
bit more details about what all these
are on the author sure let's give it is
e license and then it's going to
basically give us this JSON and
basically a summary and JSON form just
as does this look good yeah sure that
looks good and now if we take a look we
see we have a package.json file and
rendering so basically what that allows
us to do is if we share this if I put
this up on github of the package.json
and a user just downloads eight or
clones the repo and just type
an NPM install it'll just install all of
the dependencies you need to use for
that project from the package.json file
looks like we had a question here so
Robert was asking could you explain why
me we might need right sudo before her
ok so sudo is basically just like a
super user command if you typically it's
if you don't have an administrator
access or root access you have to put
sudo before this can because it is
installing it writing to the hard drive
or you know writing to the system that's
typically when you're gonna have to use
sudo if you own the computer it's
probably not a problem but if you're
using like a work computer and they're
certain you know things that are locked
off and using an install specific
software you might have to go to your
system administrator to give you access
to install these things typically
they're pretty lacks about installing
software like this especially when
you're a front-end developer but yeah
that's typically why you have to use to
go to commands just because you might
not have administrator access to it's
basically Google very MN basically it
just says I am the admin let's do this
and usually you'll have to type your
password so you do a sudo command it
will just ask for your password yeah
thanks Robert cool so we have our our
package JSON setup so now to actually
install run we're going to do the
command npm install saved em and so the
same dev thing is basically or this
command is going to save this dependency
to our package JSON as a developer to
pendency and so developer dependencies
are just anything that your website
doesn't necessarily need to run but you
as a developer are going to use to
develop your lesson I grunt is one of
those things right it's not a dependency
that our clients need to use it's really
only a dependency we're using to run
grunt so I'm going to attention this
command it's going to give you a little
warning that
there's no Rini data and then it's going
to install a bunch of stuff if I take a
look inside I now have a node modules
folder and inside that node modules
folder is the grunt node module alright
so we have grunt it can't really do
anything exciting yet because we need a
grunt file so I'm just going to make a
grunt file here and it's a JavaScript
file and let's actually open up our
project in sublime now alright hopefully
that is big enough for everybody to see
I don't know if I can make my gutter my
sidebar bigger but that's okay so we
have this grunt file now and there's
absolutely nothing in it and we also
have write our J's file we have to
JavaScript scripts and our Sassenach yes
very very advanced JavaScript going on
right here in a very you know advanced
style going on here this is actually a
sass file this is sort of a
pre-processed CSS which we're going to
use grunts to convert into usable CSS
hey if you want to learn a lot more
about you know sass feel free to do so
on your own I'll probably post a post on
the forums detailing how to go through
sass it's a really really great language
but it's a low and CSS first so I'm
going to scroll down my notes here I
real quick so the first thing we
probably want to do is we want to
compile a like I said our SAS into CSS
that's going to be a great first step
and in order to do that we're going to
have to install a grunt plugin so it
runs isn't all about plugins really I
mean you can do a lot of the stuff in
grunt without using any plugins but
people are already written a lot of code
to a lot of these things we want to do
and it's just easier utilizing plugins
so we go to the grunge is calm page and
go to their plugins section you can
search through all the plugins that they
have and any of the ones with a star
next to them are built by the grunt team
and they're typically
they're fully tested they work they're
always up to date and then anyone that
doesn't have a star next to it is made
by somebody else but there's also some
like really really good ones like I
really like the SVG min 14 I mean for
people who like using SVG it's fantastic
as you can see I mean there's like grunt
plugins for everyone um there's a total
of four thousand four hundred three
different plugins yeah and they do
everything from watching for changes to
been a code to LinkedIn to
catching and we're gonna do some of that
today so the one we're gonna want is
grunt SAS her was it what do I would i
call it because yeah good Ryan isn't SAS
Oh Harold but no matching records let's
try SAS there you go yeah yes here we go
so we're going to use this one it's not
built by the grunt team but I like it a
little bit more and so it gives us a
takes us to NPM the package manager
website and it gives us a little
direction here on how to install it and
also a few Corrections on how to use it
so in order to install it we got to go
back to your terminal and we run the
command npm install saved a front sass
right okay so this is going to save it
to our developer dependencies so when
someone else picks up our package JSON
they'll be able to install all of our
project developer dependences as well
and what that magic happen did you do a
little slow all right and it's
installing this might take a minute all
right cool we're all installed we're set
up and we're ready to start using grunts
ass so let's go back to sublime text and
actually I'm going to make this full
screen and let's start with how do we
actually had we actually start at run
file so it's obviously a blank slate so
the first thing
to do is we need to actually load our
sort of grunt module and so the first
thing we need to do is we need to create
a run basically file wrapper and so this
is pretty much what you're going to
start every grunt file you create with
it is basically just a imports grunt to
make it usable in your file this is just
basically saying I'm going to use this
crab module alright so that that's
pretty straightforward that's the direct
rapper pretty much like I said any grunt
file we write is probably going to start
with this the next thing we need to do
is we actually need to load our plugin
so to do that we use the command grunt
load npm tasks and then grunt sass so
that's going to lower our new node
module which is in our node module older
grunts ass and now we can use this in
our project so now we need to actually
configure the task so we've loaded it
now we need to actually give it some
directions so we're going to do grunt
dot an it config and this defines the
initial configuration for this grunt
task so we're calling or if we look back
at the guide here gives us a little
directions on how to define things so we
basically just call SAS we define a SAS
method and then we define our files that
we want to agree from so in this case
we're going to make our SAS
configuration we're going to say this is
the directories we want to look in and
then we have our source directory which
will be source SAS style scss and the
output destination is going to be our
disk CSS style that's the SS so you have
to have the dist folder ready mm-hmm
sorry the destination folder doesn't
need to be there early so we can see
that
yeah it'll automatically make this dist
/ CSS style without CSS file for me
alright so now we're configured and now
there's only one more step we actually
need to register the task so to register
the task what we're going to do it or
going to say grunt register dot task and
we're going to call this our default
task and our default task is going to
take takes two parameters this task
method it takes the name which we're
calling default and then it takes either
a list or a function in this case I'm
going to pass it a list and in my list
or array whatever you want to call it
I'm going to give it the name sass and
this is basically just saying call this
call this grub configuration so it's
going to call richest your task today oh
you register task there we go thank you
for catching my typos so this is
basically just saying go and execute
this task which is basically going to
load this grunts ass task and it's going
to run it so let's see how we run this
so we go back to our terminal and all we
got to do is just say grunt whew all
right running sass dist sass task done
without errors alright so let's see what
that did oh so we now have a
distribution folder with a CSS folder
and some file called style dot CSS so I
basically took my stss which I'd
by here and basically compiled it into
CSS so pretty straightforward you're
pretty simple let's let's try one more
thing so so let's follow this pattern
again except now we're going to do a
different task so we're going to
concatenate our to javascript files so
we have a to javascript files and i want
them to be one javascript file so our
users only have to do one west so this
is a pretty common practice it you know
save space to save you know bandwidth
and everything so to do this we're going
to say we're going to first install our
plug-in so we're going to say npm
install save dev and the plugin i'm
going to use his grunt contributes to
install awesome it's ready we're going
to load our task grunt the load NPM
tasks grunt can trim I could spell and
then we're going to configure our task
so we're going to have a concatfile in
this case we're going to give it our
JavaScript folder and we're going to use
what's called globbing so globbing is
basically using wildcard characters and
this gives the asterisk to say I want
you to look for any file in my
JavaScript directory that ends with a
dot jas the stars but just don't yet you
want to get all things yeah and if you
want to know well like what other sort
of wildcard characters you can use for
globbit you can feel free to google
grunt globs it'll give you a nice
outline of all the different ways you
can sort of target specific files the
asterisk just tends to be the most
common one because usually you just want
to hit all the files and specific folder
you can also hit like all subfolders so
maybe if I had like Jas in the lineup
earn trips up folders in my
this folder I can do something like this
and this will say our every folder in my
JavaScript order in any file that ends
at jas I want you to do this too but we
don't have any sub folder so we're not
going to do that and then we're going to
set a destination so we're going to put
this in our distribution fuller Jas and
I don't remember what i called it um i
think it was just call it act up jas for
fun and then the last thing is to
remember to register our task there have
been plenty of times where I've gone
through all this step all these steps
and i forgot to register it and I'm like
why isn't it running why does it run if
i go back i think i'm like like
everything looks right and it's all
because I simply didn't register a task
so we'll save that we'll go back to our
terminal and we'll type in front and we
see that it ran our SAS task arkin cat
task and finish without errors and if we
look back here we see you have a
distribution folder a jsf older and our
distribution folder and a nap j/s which
concatenated our to javascript files so
really cool so again right that was that
one that one and now they're combined
into one yes now if you want to run a
task individually so right now I have
this default task and so when i type
grunt and it automatically looks for the
task name default and runs whatever is
in that but say i just want to run my
concat i can do the grunt cacat and that
will run as we can see just my cat task
and that can be pretty useful when you
have like really big grunt files or you
begin defining a lot of like really
complex tasks and grunt can be kind of
slow if you try running like a whole
rent file it could take you know a
couple of minutes and all you really
wanted to do was compiled JavaScript
mirror sorry compile some coffee script
or can cats and JavaScript so usually if
you name your tasks correctly it's
pretty easy to just say okay just run
the cantata just run the yes
I'll task all right so that's sort of
the basic setup with Brent um you can
pretty much get away with following this
workflow um it's pretty useful I think
if you kind of stick to this workflow
but can get really unorganized and
really messy and you may end up with
like a you know a single grunt file
that's 10,000 lines long just because
you're going to have to load these tasks
at a time right every time you install a
plugin you gotta load it it could get
confusing in here like what each of
these is referencing like is this
working on my javascript is this working
on my stock pals or whatever the path is
can get confusing like say i need to
change a path or something or filename
and then I'm referencing it under times
in my file like a sublime you know it's
pretty easy because I can select you
know multiple lines but it's kind of a
pain in the ass to do with that way so
let's modularize this a little bit let's
let's make this a little bit easier to
use so the first thing and probably the
most useful thing I suggest everybody
does is use a plug-in called load grunt
tasks so we're going to say npm install
save dead because we pretty much always
have to do this load grunt tasks tasks
with an S we're going to let that
install all right so we see these two
lines up here and I probably don't want
to have to use these every time as I
start installing more plugins I don't
want to have to keep saying right load
this task grunt load this task front
load this tab it's going to get really
repetitive and annoying so with that new
plug-in what we can do is we can simply
just say require load grunt tasks and
give it our grunt object and make sure
we put a semicolon
or volunteer is going to complain me
that presence learning about that either
um so what this is going to do is this
is actually going to look at our node
modules folder it's going to look for
our dependencies and it's going to
import anything that's grep related into
this project so if we take a look back
here and we run run we can see that
everything runs fine just like before
and now anytime we have to install a
plugin we don't have to remember that
lovely lovely so that saves you know
easily won 10 15 25 tons of plugins
lines wrap code so that makes it really
simple and in that way it's less of a
step to remember right there just like
having to register a task it's easy to
forget to low the task and just like
dive right into the configuration this
saves a lot of time i feel like and i
personally like using this event grow
file when i use grant oh so that's the
first sort of thing we can do to sort of
organize our code clean it up a little
bit more additionally what we can do is
we can create a configuration file to
handle our directory so I mentioned
before right if we have a bunch of tasks
and they all have you know they're all
referencing style dot sdss and maybe I
want to change like specific tasks I
probably I'm going to want to be able to
rename these quickly make it a little
easier looks like we actually have a lot
you haven't on and uh what's great with
Stevens question and she confessed this
is a make you bloody a little bit it's a
little bit like I make utilities so make
utilities if i remember correctly are
primarily from this t c++ station wrong
and there more for you know compiling
the code optimizing the code things like
that so it's a little bit like a make
tool i think it's a little
different though I'm not super I haven't
played a lot with make files yeah but
it's kind of the same thing yeah thank
you been one is another question can you
explain when with Khun Kat be useful
would be would there be any performance
game yeah so potentially it depends um
so you may not necessarily want to
concatenate all your files together but
all your if you have multiple JavaScript
files say I'm I want to keep my coat
like you know production code like
fairly organized and modular so I can
just have open up a JavaScript file know
exactly what I'm working on um it's
going to help a lot in the end to just
concatenate all those files into appt
j/s and that way when the user it's they
can request only just one javascript
file right off the gate it gets cached
whatever and then they don't have to
keep calling that calling for different
JavaScript files every time they're
trying to run a different task they'll
have to make a bunch of requests on the
flip side sometimes it is nice to be
able to just like cut a little bit of
fat out if it's a JavaScript or
JavaScript function that's not going to
call a lot and um and then just
requested it only when the user um i
would say it depends but typically come
hat is very useful I tend to try to
concatfile as I can to just kind of get
that initial page request done um and
typically you don't see like a huge hit
to performance initially on the initial
page load um so yeah I say it's pretty
useful for pretty much anything will be
doing in this class and foremost big
projects it's pretty useful uh but yeah
just kind of play it by ear i guess and
as the web off and browser performance
optimization classes is always saying
editor measure measure measure get angry
always measure thanks man
a couple of more questions John damasks
does grun contrib gonca work with minji
S&amp;amp;J is- do without errors or do we need
to keep them ugly minify our other JSP
ID separate yeah so good i should work
with Minjae s5 I never I don't really do
a problem with it with anything yet oh I
feel like he's asking for contaminating
files that are minifying and bugs that
are not medically yeah yeah so that
won't work um I don't think I'm a very
great time out here but basically what
would end up happening is if you know
this was a min ified file please it
would basically just shove itself into
the single line and so line for would
just be like this big long unified file
and then this would be sort of like the
onion if I'd care healthy you can use
rut to actually do minification as well
and your files already unified it'll
just run it through the minnow fire
again really fast but yeah they although
they play pretty nice together basically
all it does is it just sort of my pens
on the javascript files together there's
a little bit more that goes on there but
that's sort of that the rule of thumb
okay thanks Tim for the question couple
of more yeah and breeding my favor is
still mourn fill another reflection okay
sir richard ass says the seams
decorative but does grunt or any dust
support convention over dimension over
configuration for example dope dope does
he likes golf oh yeah so let's all very
there's over here so for example if you
wanted to use image matic to former
transform images and images folder does
it support using that convention verse
declaring the source and dest yeah so
with grunt you can do a little bit of
like just strict jas coding however it's
really all about a config file I mean
grunt is very much configuration over
convention whereas goal if you want to
dive into
open are interested in learning that
that you're right pure JavaScript it's
like strict like no JavaScript and
everything instead of writing this big
configuration file where I'm basically
just defining a giant JSON object yeah
yeah so uh grunts is pretty much the
philosophy would grunts his
configuration over thanks Richard hey
Andrews question is I know gold with
something similar and run how are they
different in what are some pros and cons
a few things okay so besides this I
think I mentioned the the grunts takes
the kind of configuration over coding
approach gulp is more you're writing
JavaScript unless about writing a giant
config file the other kind of major
differences between them two is gold is
a lot faster since it is all sort of
running asynchronously the way to really
utilize this node and it's just sort of
streaming through node whereas grunt
until I'm not sure there's a let me lay
back tracker mr. Brent in its current
form is very slow um behind the scenes
it kind of sets up like a bunch of
temporary folders and handles all these
tasks in there runs a bunch of stuff and
kind of clears that out and then it just
runs like a lot slower because of X it's
performing a lot more operations whereas
gulp is just much more streamlined
however grunt has a much bigger
community you're probably going to more
easily find help with grunt and there's
a lot more packages although it's
starting to become a little bit closer
both is gaining popularity the only
other thing I can think of is with grunt
it's easy to hand it over to someone who
doesn't know JavaScript that well and
say like have them like set it up and
use it whereas we gulp it's a little bit
harder to like handle
all over someone who doesn't have
JavaScript and for them to look at it
and understand what's going on hey
thanks Andrew ok I guess door at three
more questions I guess Alexandra wanted
to know getting fast a list of source
files instead of using white cars when
you're Bobby yeah yeah i believe so
let's take a look let's go back i think
if you do i think you can give this a
list uh-huh 1 i'll see source yes script
I can spell I'm just I think that works
it's been a while since I've tried that
see ya yeah so you can provide them as
an array alright list or less whatever
you want on yeah so you can do that
instead of using wildcards um yeah so
you can be a little bit more precise in
what you're passing along hey Adam
wanted to know why not just use nvm
directly from you and I actually
recommend yeah yeah it's maybe just a
little bit more I think I think grunt
and gulp simplify things a little thin
um and they do have a lot of support
like they're really great tools you can
do it all from NPM directly though uh
it's just a little bit more work yeah
hey well putting very fast do it that
way one last question before we can go
back so that asks is there a grunt
plugin for adding unit desks yeah yeah
unit testing with grim as possible I
don't what does the plugin I mean
there's a bunch of them I mean I guess
it depends on what testing environment
you're using so i'm using karma there's
a karma test runner chai
there's one maybe there's control unit
which lets you know you get unit tests
so yeah there's a bunch of them and as
you can see it i mean you can just go
through and search for all kinds of so
yeah there's a lot of plugins to set up
unit tests with grunt say Michael hey um
yeah we're done with session so we can
go back to its we're talking about what
was I talking about me right oh yeah so
um dealing with all these pads and file
names that are cluttering up our yeah
our fire directory sorry I regret file
here so what we can do is we can create
what I like to call a mammal or you'll
yell whole file so I'm going to make a
grunt file dot yml and this is going to
be a file that I pretty much keep all my
directories in so I'm going to have an
scss dÃ¼rer and I'm going to source ass
I'm gonna have my Jess source directory
which is gonna be right source j/s got
really bad typing today cat dirt she's
going to be our distribution for our
concatenation and also my CSS directory
which is going to be my distribution for
my CSS so I'm going to find these in
Miami file and in my a grunt file i'm
going to import this configuration our
config equals grunt file dot read gamal
i'm going to read in my grunt config yml
so now I have this configuration
variable which contains any sort of
configuration i define in this file now
you can do you can do a lot more than
just setting up to
varies with this so it's pretty portable
and it makes kind of making this a
little cleaner nice and now instead of
if I have you know 100 different tasks
tasks or something and I need to change
the name or directory for something
simply just change it changes all of
them in here without having a mess
around too much with everything and if
you miss one or make a typo somewhere um
so now I could just say okay I want this
to be my my source directory something
that I call it my scss they're actually
going to do this to make things a little
easier so I can see that and then our
sorry uh neck poppy yes I'm gonna say it
config because my config variable there
we go and then the scss der and then my
style uh dot J yes I believe right
that's just directory yes the silo j/s
there we go and then my destination now
is just config dot CSS dirt plus style
dot CSS accept this is not it jas file
okay and then the same thing here we can
just simply say config and then we're
going to do our Jas source stir plus
whatever you type rjs files and then
here we're going to say just our config
dot j askin cat directory and that's
going to be captain is so that makes a
little bit easier to go in and sort of
change where things output or input from
you know you can also like I said do a
lot more sort of your configure your
yellow file huh
I don't know I actually probably don't
want to call that grunt file I wanted to
call it grunt config otherwise it's not
going to work right because I call me
for anything so now if we run run we
should see hopefully everything my
mother that I are all right cool so one
cool thing we can do now if Francis do
you know now that we have this defined
we can easily like lint our files as
well not in both sort of our source and
help it directory this is good practice
because often times you have coding
mistakes in your source directory or
maybe you know when you concatenate
files or something happens if break some
little rules that you don't want it to
break so we're going to install a linter
here in particular we use jazz hint so I
shouldn't have to say this again but
we're going to say npm install save dev
dev grunt contribs as hints and that's
going to install and so now right we
don't have to load our task we can just
say we're going to create our j/s hint
yep and we're going to say let's Lin to
everything we're going to let our grub
file she's usually good practice and
we're going to lunch our source
directory getting next time yes so we're
a little more files and we got to
remember to register it otherwise it's
not gonna run I'm gonna get mad um so
now we can run drugs oh and you got a
warning i'm missing a semicolon in my
grundle
where am I missing my semicolon online
32 yeah so cool i thought that and so
the nice thing about that too is in fact
you should probably call your mentor
first before you do any of your other
javascript asks that way they don't
compile so basically this didn't run
anything because it aborted because
there was a literary so now if i do
grunt it should work done without errors
cool now let's stay with 10 where was
the specific rule with our linter let's
say for example we want to enforce that
we have to use turtle equals 0 time like
we don't want people to use double
equals in this case we can define in
options attribute so this is good in the
winter this is within the winter class
or JSN furnishings in class rjs can't
mention that and so in this options
we're going to give it a full equal
equal is true so ge'ez hint has pretty
comprehensive documentation on what kind
of flags and options you can put up i
think if you go to their docs or list of
all j's int options you can go in and
read about like all the rules you can
force and the one we're enforcing is e
QE QE q this option prohibits the use of
double equals and not equals in favor
and triple equal signs and not equal
equal so let's see if this worked so
let's go into our script let's save that
and let's run drugs and there we go a
cop that error it tells us that you know
a equal equals be expected triple equal
and instead saw don't equal so we can go
fix that run grunt into ray everything
wrong is just fine so that's pretty
awesome
so the last thing I want to talk about
before you're out today and actually
this repository I give you guys goes
even a little further than this but the
last thing I wanted to talk about was
defining from watch task and what tasks
are really really cool so as we're doing
before basically a red code and then I'd
go in and run through out to every time
I wanted something to happen but saying
hey I just wanted to focus on coding
right and I wanted you know maybe to add
some more JavaScript here and I wanted
when I saved this to automatically run
my current tasks so what we can do is we
can create what I can watch tasks and as
always we need to install plugin so
we're going to do npm install say dev
grunt contribute install its installed
we're good to go and you don't need to
load it don't needs a lot of it hey they
already did that and so now what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
watch task and so in our watch task
we're going to watch or to have
different watch tasks in this case I'm
going to have a sasquatch task and the
files that I'm going to define here are
the files that were watching so in this
case we're going to watch our source our
SAS directory we're going to be
specifically looking for anything any
sub directory or file that ends with s
CSS okay then we have to define what
tasks we're going to run again this can
be a function or I believe it actually I
think it has to be an array and we're
going to call or SAS function we can
also you know call other function so i
can call jess in tazewell on here you
know execute both of these on a change
but obviously since we're editing a sass
file we don't need to print it so let's
do that and also don't forget to
register it so before when we ran a task
right and said done without errors let's
see what happens this time so I called
grunt hopefully no yours all right there
you and now he says now it says
running watch task waiting so let's see
what happens let's go in here and get
rid of this important tags we probably
shouldn't be using those I save it and
we see that file has changed running
this task done with that errors and now
it's waiting again for more change if we
take a look here we can see that are
important is let the building let's add
another thing let's say block let's do
HTML height 100% save it go back to our
style and there we go automatically
compiled grand that task because we're
watching that file so watch tests are
really really really awesome um you can
even set up watch tasks that will watch
you know your JavaScript you can set up
watch tasks that will basically just
recompile or in any task you want when
certain files change it becomes really
really useful when you want to just be
able to focus on coding and not have to
worry about you know minifying
everything all the time and now we can
switch back and forth between those so
that's about what we have time for today
yeah I had actually a lot more planned
but i'll put those up on the forum so
you can feel free to follow along with
the rest the rest is a little advanced
you don't necessarily have to do that
what i showed you here in the day is
probably enough to get you started with
grunt and get you using it pretty
reasonably if you have any questions
though feel free to post on the forum
and you can add me directly in the post
at john nav that's Jo HN and maybe and
yet and unless we have any other
questions I think we might call it a
wrap for today how did that go did I do
good job there is wonderful I hope you
also the same way as I did yeah so the
like I said
once it's going to be really useful in
the future I don't know front and work
full stack developer who doesn't use it
or something similar um like I said
grunt and gulp are the two most popular
but there's millions of them out there I
know kind of an up-and-coming one that I
haven't really had a chance to use yet
is broccoli yeah but it looks pretty
promising but it's still very new it
doesn't have a lot to support yet so
then probably is not as easy to learn
about but there's you know hundreds of
these different your vegetable I forget
there might be another vegetable one
here did another one that's okay yeah
all these crazy it is crazy things
granite cold broccoli oh thank you adam
and says reach out oh thank you alright
cool so thank you everybody for joining
us today uh why are you next Monday next
Monday yeah and we're going to meet
another feature yeah more teachers yep
oh alright thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
