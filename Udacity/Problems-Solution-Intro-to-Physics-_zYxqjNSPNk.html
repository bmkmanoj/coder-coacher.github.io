problems I don't want to only be able to
tell time at night on those special
instances when the moons are passing
behind a planet furthermore telescopes
are going to be almost impossible to use
on a ship as it bounces around on the
waves this is going to wind up being the
biggest problem that telescopes are so
hard to use on a ship so Galileo
actually invented something that he
thought would help address this problem
well he invented was this ridiculous
contraption called the cell atone which
you can see here in the black in the red
and it was basically just a helmet where
one I had the telescope over it and the
other I was just an open hole and the
idea was you could cite and find the
idea for where Jupiter was through this
hole and then really zoom in and focus
and watch the transit of the moons
through the telescope as you can maybe
imagine this didn't work so well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
