portion of the globe we can see CNA and
Alexandria
now here the sun's ray strikes
vertically which by vertical we mean
perpendicular to the earth here at
Alexandria it doesn't strike vertically
if I drew a line perpendicular to the
earth I can see there's some angle here
which we don't know just yet now we're
trying to find the circumference of the
earth we found out that as we move
further north from Alexandria this angle
actually gets bigger and the shadow gets
bigger as well so it seems like there's
some relationship hopefully a
mathematical one between this angle and
the circumference of the earth let's see
if we can figure it out so I'm actually
going to start by making a wish list and
this wish list is going to contain
everything that I wish I knew in order
to solve this problem and hopefully
we'll be able to come back to it later
and address everything on it so I wish I
knew this angle and I'm gonna call it
the Greek letter alpha we're dealing
with the Greeks why not use a Greek
letter and it's pretty common to call it
angles alpha in physics okay so on my
wish list I wish I had that angle the
angle alpha now what are we gonna do
with this angle alpha let's not even
worry about how to calculate it yet what
are we gonna do with it well whenever I
get stuck on a geometry problem I start
drawing lines and they usually help me
and since a circle is involved here or a
sphere but we're only looking at a
circular cross-section of it drawing
lines from the center is usually a good
idea so I'm going to draw a line from
the center to CNA and from the center to
Alexandria
okay now there's still not a ton jumping
out to me maybe I'll extend this line
that sometimes helps me see what's going
on
ah okay something just jumped out to me
this angle alpha shows up in more than
one place I'll tell you there are other
angles on this drawing that are equal to
alpha maybe one maybe more I'm gonna
mark some contenders and once you tell
me which ones are correct what about
this angle is that equal to alpha check
that box if you think it is well what
about this angle is that equal to alpha
this one or what about this one so for
this quiz just go ahead and check all
the angles that you think are equal to
this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
