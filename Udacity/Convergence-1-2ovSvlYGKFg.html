a statement of the theorem we're not
going to prove the theorem that's really
up to people like chubba seviche body
but we're going to state the theorem and
understand the theorem well enough so
that we can apply it to showing that
q-learning converges okay so the first
thing we're going to do is just to make
things simpler to write down we're going
to say that Q learning and update
algorithms like that are going to update
all state action values on all time
steps however if it's a state action
value that doesn't actually correspond
to the current state action pair that we
just experienced then we just set the
learning rate to zero right so that just
means leave the Q values alone except
for in the state action pair where you
actually just experience and got a
transition okay this is the beginning of
the statement of the theorem so we're
going to say B is going to be some
contraction mapping so this is going to
this is going to be the bellman operator
ultimately Q star equals be Q star
that's the fixed point that's the
solution to the bellman equation so Q
star is like Q star okay and let's
imagine that we've got some sequence of
Q functions that starts off with Q zero
and the way we're going to generate the
next step from the previous step is
we're going to we have a new kind of
operator B sub T be sub T is going to be
applied to Q sub T producing an operator
that we then apply to Q sub T and that's
what we signed QT plus one to be so in
the context of Q learning this is going
to be a this is essentially the Q
learning update but we're going to
separate out the two different q
functions that are used in the queue
learning update one is the past Q
function that we're using to average
together to take care of the fact that
there's noise in the transitions and
then the other Q function is the one
that we're using in one step look ahead
as part of the bellman equation but
we'll get to that in a moment but here's
the cool thing that this sequence of Q
functions starting from any q0 that we
want as long as we keep applying this is
going to go to Q star yay as long as we
have certain properties holding on how
we define these beasts of tease</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
