non-deterministic polynomial time
decidable problems that is to say that
it's a problem that can be solved by a
program that runs in polynomial time but
has non deterministic elements in it now
I'm gonna explain what that is in just a
moment but first what I'd like to do is
give you a handle on intuitively what
this means I like to say I like to say
that n P stands for nice puzzle problems
so let me explain what I mean by that so
think of a problem like solving a Sudoku
problem you might phrase this as a
decision problem by saying here's a grid
can this be filled in to complete the
Sudoku problem and it has to satisfy
that if you don't know this is a very
popular newspaper puzzle that involves
you're given a bunch of numbers and a
nine by nine grid and you have to fill
in more numbers you have to fill in all
the grid cells and ultimately the
solution that you fill in has to have
the property that every row and every
column has the numbers one through nine
and each block each of these dark blocks
also has the numbers one through nine so
I can give you a Sudoku like this and it
could be very very challenging to know
whether or not this can be completed to
satisfy the Sudoku constraints but the
next day in the newspaper or if it's a
puzzle magazine maybe at the back of the
puzzle magazine it's very easy to
convince you that the if the answer is
yes so if the answer is yes then I can
prove it to you by simply giving you a
small what's called sir accepting
certificate which in this case just
means a filled in Sudoku board so if I
fill in the Sudoku board you can very
quickly do two things check to see if
it's correct if all the rows and columns
have the numbers one through nine
that's a polynomial-time decision
problem that you can that you can write
really easily and also check if the if
the the cells that you're given match
what was given in the original puzzle
and that also is a very fast thing to be
able to check all you have to do is run
through the cells of the original
puzzle and each time there was something
that was filled in check if it matches
in the answer so even though it may be
very difficult to answer the question if
you're given the right kind of
information you can check it very fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
