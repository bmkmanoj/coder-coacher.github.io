games of pig what is doubling well if
you're familiar with the game of
backgammon which is a gambling game with
dice doubling is a way to end the game
early and the idea is that when we start
out each game is worth one point but in
the course of the game if one player is
winning then he can propose to double
the stakes of the game so that it's
worth two points that it say costs two
dollars to the that the winner wins from
the loser rather than one dollar or two
euros or whatever currency were playing
with then when the player makes that
move of doubling then the opponent has a
choice he must immediately either accept
or decline if the opponent accepts then
we play the game and it's worth two
points if the opponent declines then the
proposer of the double immediately wins
one and the game is over now in
backgammon doubling can go on infinitely
from one to two to four to eight to
sixteen and so on for pig we're only
going to round allow one round of
doubling so the games are going to start
off being worth one point and can go up
to two points but no more than that so
we're going to define a a whole new game
the top level function will be called
play pig dd4 double and all our
functions will end in that d a state in
this game will be just like before with
one new value for the doubling amount so
a state will have the player to play the
score for me the score for you the
pending score and an extra field for the
double and the double can either be one
for two and we said we're not going to
allow it to go higher than that or it
can be the string double and it takes
that value only at one point during the
game when the first player proposes a
double and then the second player has
the choice of accept or decline that
player will see a double in the state
field and then we'll have to reply so
what I want you to do is write these two
functions Pig actions d which takes a
state and returns all the legal actions
from that state and here's the
description of what they can be and I
want you to define some strategy
function strategy d that gives a state
which is
in the doubling pig game and returns a
good action and what do I mean by good
well it's got to be better than this
strategy function hold 20 d which holds
at 20 and 0 is accepts when offers a
double never doubles and holds it at 20
or rolls otherwise and you should define
a strategy that's better than that if
you want you can try to define the
optimal strategy but you're not required
to do that and I've defined for you the
main function play big d it's similar to
what we had before except the result
that's returned is two values now both
the winning strategy and the value of
the game which will be either one or two
and then the other difference is we got
rid of the roll and hold functions and
now we replaced it with just one do
function which takes an action and a
state and it passes along the die rolls
and then does that action so this is
really the definition of how the game
works where the actions can be rolling
holding doubling declining and accepting
then die rolls are as before we define
the clueless function which just takes a
random choice from among the legal
actions you should definitely be able to
beat that but you also got to be able to
beat the whole 20 strategy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
