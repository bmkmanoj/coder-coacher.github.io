question we have of how hard is
factoring and we saw that it was
possible to factor 129 decimal digits in
1994 and the computing resources to do
this were about sixteen hundred machines
collaborating on the Internet
certainly that's much less than many
people have access to today there are
larger numbers that have been broken
since the largest challenge that's been
broken so far was RSA 768 which was a
challenge and those are bits instead of
decimal digits so that's equivalent to
232 decimal digits and that was done in
2009 using about 2000 years of
computational power so if we want to
know that RSA is secure we need to
understand how the cost of factoring
depends on the size of the numbers that
we need to factor we'd like to know that
if we pick a large enough key even an
adversary with a large amount of
computational power and as the years go
on adversaries will have more and more
power still won't be able to factor the
number and break the RSA we don't know
any way to actually prove a problem like
this is fundamentally hard the best we
can do is look at the best known
algorithms and have some confidence
because people have worked very hard to
find better algorithms and progress has
been slow that barring some very
unexpected breakthrough it won't get
much faster this is quite unsatisfying
but it's the best we can do so to talk
about this I want to measure the size of
the input and that's the number of bits
we'll use be for that in the modulus so
we could try a brute force approach
which would go through all the numbers
from 2 up to the square root of n
checking whether each one is a factor if
it finds a factor then it returns that
let's be optimistic and assume
unrealistically that we could do this
factoring test which could be done by
finding the greatest common divisor of
the two numbers in constant time well
then we're going to need to go through
this loop square root of n times which
means our running time will be linear in
the square root of n but B is the log of
n so our running time will be
exponential in B over 2 so this clearly
is not going to work for large D but
this is not the best known factoring
algorithm
the fastest no in factoring algorithm as
of 2012 when I'm recording this is
what's known as the general number field
sieve and this little bit faster than
the brute force but it's still
essentially requires trying all
possibilities so it's running time is
exponential and B to the 1/3 log B to
the 2/3 which is still much worse than
being polynomial one important caveat
this is the best known factoring
algorithm assuming a classical computer
if you have a large quantum computer
which no one does yet there's a faster
algorithm which is known as Shor's
algorithm which was created by Peter
shor in 1994 and that actually has a
running time that's polynomial in the
number of bits so this development which
we won't go into more depth in this
class is both why there's a tremendous
amount of practical interest as well as
theoretical interest in quantum
computing it seems to allow for some
problems that seem to be hard a way to
compute them more efficiently so this
means that factoring is in a complexity
class called bounded error quantum
polynomial time known as bqp
what's unknown is whether factoring is
in the class np-hard which are the
hardest problems that can be solved by a
non-deterministic Turing machine in
polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
