criteria for what constitutes likely or
unlikely if we get a sample mean in the
critical region here for a one-tailed
test or here or here for a two-tailed
test then we decide that most likely we
did not get this sample mean by chance
note that in the case of a two-tailed
test the Z critical values are the same
used to calculate confidence intervals
here you're just applying the same ideas
to different situations when we do
statistical tests we'll set our own
criteria for making a decision in other
words we'll choose an alpha level and
then we'll decide that if the
probability of obtaining a particular
sample mean is less than that alpha
level then there's evidence of in effect
usually we're going to stick with an
alpha level of 0.05 at an alpha level of
0.05 we have two possible outcomes in
either situation one-tailed or
two-tailed either the sample mean will
lie outside of the critical region or
inside the critical region we notate
these two outcomes as the null
hypothesis which we call H naught or H
Sub Zero and the alternative hypothesis
H sub a other ways of notating this
could be H sub 1 but I'll just stick
with H sub a for alternative the null
hypothesis assumes that there is no
significant difference between the
current population parameters and what
will be the new population parameters
after some sort of intervention so we'll
notate it like current population
parameter mu is equal to the population
parameters after the intervention where
when we say equal we don't mean exactly
equal we just mean they're not
significantly different
the alternative hypothesis guess is that
there will be a significant difference
either the current population mean will
be less than that after the intervention
or the current population mean will be
greater or that it'll just be different
and we don't predict a direction of the
treatment for the null hypothesis when
we're guessing that there is no
significant difference between these two
parameters our sample mean will I
somewhere outside the
erricka region in this white space note
also that for a one-tailed test the
critical region could be on the left
tail not just the right and the
alternative hypothesis guess is that
there is a significant difference and
that means that our sample mean will lie
somewhere in the critical region</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
