to a different category of mental
disorders and those are dissociative
disorders these disorders produce
extreme disruptions or gaps in memory
identity or consciousness and the dsm-5
puts them in their own category this is
a condition in which cognitive processes
are disjointed and fragmented this
disorder often stems from exposure to
trauma or extreme stress and even
physical or sexual assault that occurs
and it's most likely to occur during
childhood individuals with dissociative
identity disorder will develop at least
two separate independent identities now
this used to be called multiple
personality disorder these individuals
experienced two or more distinct
personality states amnesia and
self-destructive behaviors here a person
may find themselves at a hotel and not
remember how they got there
they may injure themselves or not be
able to remember a particular experience
in their life this is reportedly due to
the fact that the other personality is
the one engaging in these behaviors this
disorder is another example of a
position that psychologists disagree on
some psychologists don't agree that this
is an actual diagnosis some even suggest
that the separate personalities are
ultimately produced by the therapist so
we see here that some psychologists
state that this is a real disorder in
some state that it's not now let's go
back to Susan to talk about disorders
that affect the body and the mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
