discussed in this lesson first we
discuss the components to an effective
information visualization they were
visual cues the coordinate system the
scale and data types and the context
after that we dived a little bit deeper
into the various different ways that we
can encode data of Julie these included
size position color and many more we
also discussed various scales and data
types such as numerical categorical end
time series we took a deeper dive in the
time series since that's what most of
the data for our assignment will look
like and finally we went over the basics
of creating graphics using ggplot a
library for python for this week's
assignment you'll use what we've learned
in this lesson that is the basic
principles of data visualization and the
basics of how to create a graphic in
ggplot you'll create a few basic
visualizations that describe things
about the New York City subway so you'll
want to communicate to people our
statistical findings from assignment 3
but also maybe just some general
information regarding the subway
ridership at various hours of the day
how many people are going into and out
of different stations etc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
