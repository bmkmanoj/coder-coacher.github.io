I've thought about in the past I think
makes makes for good illustration so
we've got four underlying states these
four here the four circles and we've got
two actions the actions essentially move
the agent left and right all right along
this kind of hallway type thing with
some exceptions so from the Green State
any action just resets you randomly to
one of the blue states and otherwise
things move left and right at the end of
the hallways here these two end States
if you try to go right when there's no
more space to go you just stick where
you were and if you try to go left when
there's no more space to go you stick
where you were and just to you know to
ground it the rest of the way out
actions that take you to the Green State
give you a reward of one so is that does
that make some sense to you do you do
follow how this would go I do and it's
uh I just realize if I don't know which
blue state I'm in this is a scary scary
little problem to try to solve good so
that was the thing I guess I neglected
to point out I'm showing the
observations in this diagram with the
colors so let me just number the states
just for ease of referring to them we've
got three states one two three and four
state one is blue state two is blue
state four is blue based on the
immediate observation alone we don't
know really where we are and we could be
a place that's to the right of the goal
so we should go left to get reward or we
could be a place that's the left of the
goal which means we're gonna have to go
right to get reward and so we're kind of
in a tricky spot yeah this is uh this is
unfortunate you trapped like a rat in
the maze oh I see I see yeah you're
pointing at the two to you this looks
like a rat drawing but it really is not
supposed to be a rat this is not the
nose this is not the tail it really is
just transitions I think you death
protest too much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
