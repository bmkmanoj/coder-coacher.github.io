problem that's commonly known as a time
bomb a time bomb is an infection in the
code that's just waiting to explode into
your face as a failure here's something
that's definitely wrong and it's in
there and it's sleeping it can be there
for millions of cycles only when it's
being accessed or processed that's when
the time bomb explodes and this is hard
to debug because you have to figure out
where the time bomb originally was
planted and set
that's where assertions save the day an
assertion prohibits time bomb by
checking whether the data is sane at the
very moment it is being stored when we
are creating a time object we could for
instance use assertions to make sure
that the arguments actually are all
within specified ranges for instance we
could say the hour must mean between 0
and 23 at the same time we give a hint
to the user that time uses 24-hour
format we also want to make sure that
the minutes and the seconds are within
the proper ranges between 0 and 59
respectively this special syntax you see
over here is a speciality of Python
which allows to curse multiple
comparisons into one actually now that I
think of it 59 is not correct here
there's years in which there's leap
seconds and if there's a leap second
then they can actually be 61 seconds in
a minute so in order to be perfectly
correct this needs to be 60 up here this
is still a very simplistic time class it
just assumes say local time for instance
we don't care about time zones or
calendars or daylight savings times or
anything at this point a real time class
is way more complicated than this one
now let's see well these assertions help
us in avoiding time bombs we still have
the string passed in here let's see
whether our assertion catches this again
press and run and see as we put in two
minutes after midnight as a string the
assertion failed because the string is
not between the values of 0 and 23 what
happens if we pass negative values in
here say ours is valid minutes is
negative second to the villain press on
run and again we get a failing assertion
now we get the feeling assertion that
the minutes is not within the right
range which is exactly what we wanted to
catch with these assertions appear any
attempt to set any time object to an
illegal State will immediately be
detected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
