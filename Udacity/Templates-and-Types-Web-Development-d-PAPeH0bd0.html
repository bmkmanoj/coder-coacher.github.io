we're treating it like an it let's take
a look at our code again so in our code
here we're getting n from the request
and we're just storing on the variable n
here now the problem is when things come
out of the request
they're always strings so if we want to
if we want to be an integer we need to
make it an integer let's go ahead and do
that so basically if n was specified
convert it into an integer now let's see
if it works in our browser okay here we
are n equals 1 I'm going to hit enter
and indeed equals 1 and if we set it to
something else and there's not equal 1
and if I set it to a string we don't get
anything and actually what really
happened is we got an error because we
tried to convert the string Steve into
an integer and Python did not like that
we're not going to go ahead and fix that
but what I wanted to show you was that
when expect an integer as a parameter
from the user you need to actually
convert it because the web application
or the browser's or the HTTP it has no
idea what's an integer and what's a
string so you have to actually do that
check yourself and if we want to make
that previously example work we would
have to check to see is the string all
digits first and then only then convert
it to an integer so it's a common
mistake I actually I made it when I was
doing this lesson in the first place and
so I thought I would let you see it as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
