advanced persistent threat they tend to
target specific organizations well as
Barnett's tend to have parts all over
the internet apt is advanced which means
that it uses special malware sometimes
the malware is specifically crafted for
the targeted organization but whether
often the malware is actually a special
version of a common malware that has
been used in other botnets by starting
from a common malware the attackers
behind apts want to have both chimeneas
and deniability that is security emmons
would not suspect that the malware is
apt they would think that this is a new
version of the common malware advanced
can also mean special operations that is
apt is not used for common attacks and
frauds such as spamming and click fraud
or fishing rather it can be used for
very high value operation such as
stealing the design of a new airplane
apt is persistent meaning that once the
malware gets into an organization is
going to stay there for a long time and
it typically involves multiple steps
each step is low and slow to avoid
detection for example rather than
sending out the design of the airplane
which is a large volume of data to the
internet at once the apt can break the
data into multiple chunks and then you
can send each chunk to the internet
whenever there is a user connecting to
the internet that is the transmission of
each chunk of data will not raise any
suspicion APD is a very dangerous threat
because as we have discussed apts tend
to target high-value organizations and
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
