what is refactoring refactoring is the
process of applying transformations or
refactorings to a program so as to
obtain a refactor program with an
improved design but with the same
functionality as the original program so
a key aspect of refactoring is the fact
that refactoring should be semantics
preserving so what is the main goal or
refactoring the goal is to keep the
program readable understandable and
maintainable as we evolve it and to do
this by eliminating small problem soon
so that you can avoid big trouble later
and I want to stress once more a key
feature of refactoring which is the fact
that it is behavior preserving but how
can we ensure that their effect on is
behavior preserving in other words how
can we ensure that the program does the
same thing before and after applying a
refactoring so what we would like to do
is to have some guarantee that that
happens and unfortunately in general
there are no guarantees but something we
can do is to test the code for example
we can write test the exercise the parts
of the program affected by the
refactoring and if we're in an agile
context we might already have a plenty
of test cases that exercise that part of
the code so we may just have to rerun
the test cases after the refactor and in
fact that's a very advantageous
situation and that's a very good use of
existing test cases and I want to make
sure that you remember and that should
be where that tests provide no
guarantees testing can only show the
presence of the fact but cannot
demonstrate their absence so we can use
testing to get confidence in our
refactorings but we can really guarantee
that the refactorings our behavior
preserving I also like to point out for
some simple refactoring we can use
static analysis to actually provide
these guarantees and in fact we will see
examples of such refactorings that are
incorporated into IDs and that leverage
this kind of analysis to perform
refactoring in a safe way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
