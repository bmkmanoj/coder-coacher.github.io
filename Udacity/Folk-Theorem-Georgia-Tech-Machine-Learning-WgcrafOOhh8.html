a way to make the prisoner's dilemma a
little more friendly it turns out though
that this this idea this sort of core
idea is very general and kind of cool so
it leads us to a topic that we could
call repeated games and the folk theorem
so the general idea here is that when
you're in the repeated game setting this
possibility of retaliation the possible
of you know not being cooperative
actually opens the door for cooperation
because now it becomes it can become
better to just get along and cooperate
than to get retaliated against right and
that makes sense as long as the
retaliation is plausible well we're not
talking about plausibility the
retaliation we're just talking about
right because the tit-for-tat does it
just not analyze in that way it doesn't
say whether or not it's actually
plausible it just says well if you have
this strategy and you play against this
strategy there's no incentive to switch
right but what yeah we'll get into this
plausibility thing in a little bit Oh
across a word okay but I want to point
out one thing first which actually kind
of irritates me it kind of an along the
same lines as like regression is the
wrong word and reinforcement is the
wrong word folk theorem is the wrong
word so what is a folk theorem in
general in mathematics sorry say again a
folk theorem with two words that's fair
yes
so I think it's actually two different
terms of art so in mathematics folk
theorems are results that are known at
least to experts in the field and
they're considered to have established
status but they're not really published
in their complete form there isn't some
kind of original publication saying oh
look I found this thing it's more
something that like kind of everybody
knows and so you don't really give
anybody credit for it so it's like a
theorem that is in the general cloud of
understanding it's sort of among the
population among the group wait does
anyone ever prove these folk theorems
you can yeah all folk theorems are
provable but it's not like you you say
that you know this is Charles is Bell's
Theorem it's like no it's just a folk
theorem it's like Charles Charles can
prove it we can all prove it but we're
not really sure who ever proved it first
it was just one of those things that
everybody knows oh so it's like an oral
tradition yeah yeah
that's a good way to think about okay
I'm just imagining mathematicians
sitting around a fire in the winter
cuddled up against one another sharing
theorems that have been proved since the
beginning of time to one another exactly
right that's the image that I have as
well this just it's folk theorems it's
this sort of but you know I learned it
from my grandmother and now I'm telling
you hmm
I like that I like to think of
mathematicians that way so so that's
what a folk theorem is in mathematics
however in game theory it means
something different it is referring to a
folk theorem but it's also referring to
a particular folk theorem so the folk
theorem in game theory refers to a
particular result that describes the set
of payoffs that can result from Nash
strategies in repeated games so it's a
funny thing it's a funny way that they
use the word it's it's a it's a folk
theorem but it's also the folk there hmm
well maybe it was actually proven the
first time by some guy named folk that's
a good idea
we should probably we should push that
forward like call him folk or something
other folks theorem yeah but uh but no
oh well I tried yeah that's it that's a
really great idea that we're gonna just
move on from but what I what I'd like to
do next is kind of build up to this
notion of the folk theorem and it's
gonna require a couple basic concepts
that are not too different from stuff
we've already talked about but we're
gonna kind of make them concrete and
then we're gonna show how they all come
together to provide us with this idea of
a folk theorem
