let me just point out three quick facts
about correlated equilibrium cool okay
so here's the first one correlated
equilibria or siiii as the cool kids
called can be found in polynomial time
so this is a good thing so even though I
didn't you know tell you how i found the
one-third one-third one-third zero
correlative equilibrium in the previous
example you can find that in a
reasonable amount of time i found that
any of the more B's amount of time which
is i looked up the example and i wrote
down the numbers which is also
polynomial okay in fact is linear okay
so and that's not so true of nash
equilibria right at nash equilibria are
hard to find yes they are which is
unfortunate nobody okay I mean it gets a
nice advantage of correlated equilibria
that's true but Nash sounds so cool well
in any case okay the second fact is all
mixed Nash equilibria are in fact
correlated so this means that correlated
equilibria exist that comes from what we
discussed before that you know there's
always at least a possibly mixed Nash
equilibrium cool and of course pure
natural colibri are themselves and makes
nash equilibria therefore correlated
equilibria exist gotcha okay finally
wait you pure in the sense of you know
the original definition of right exactly
okay and then third one is and this just
kind of follows from probability all
convex combinations of mixed Nash
equilibria are in fact correlated whoa
okay there's a lot there and we could
talk about it forever but the basic idea
is that coryell equilibria kind of cool
traffic lights are not a bad idea and
coming up with them isn't impossibly
hard unlike all that other stuff you
talked about before with palm dp's where
they're undecidable and life is terrible
at least here we can actually find
pretty good correlated released we can
find correlated equilibria that's a
relief it is a relief okay so i think
i'm ready to go on to the next thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
