bit so this is basically the 2d image
transformations we looking at we have an
object that could be translated this
could be the image itself we could scale
it in this case I'm showing a scaling we
could rotate it and a fine warp and a
projective or a perspective warp would
be this one so basically let's summarize
all of them I'm going to show this with
a simple kind of a table here and of
course we look at how we actually want
to do the transformation what the three
by three looks like and what kinds of
things does it preserve of course simple
translation two degrees of freedom and
we know how to kind of model this
basically basically these are the two
parameters we would actually be kind of
modeling and of course in this case you
only get translation orientation is
preserved case of euclidean where there
is a rigid transformation three degrees
of freedom the object is rotated here of
course we would change if there is
translation involved even these two
values but also just another cosine
theta and stuff like that would change
these four values here to this would
still remain one as it is here and of
course 0000 these I'm not implying that
this would be a zero it just means that
the cosine values based on theta would
be coming in in this case lens would be
preserved third case similarity where
now we have scaled things up for degrees
of freedom basically what that means is
now we basically have the two parameters
for translation swimming there's
translation going on and scaled
parameters would be here the rest would
be the same for our fine we've looked at
this just in the quiz before everything
that would appear to serve a parallelism
would be preserved lines would be
straight and everything else we also
know that the six parameters here would
be the ones we would need to model and
that's the six degrees of freedom
projective are eight degrees of freedom
all of these this would be still one
straight lines are preserved parallelism
is not preserved so if you notice as we
go down this preserves orientation
because it's only translation this
doesn't preserve orientation but it
preserves lens but next time all of the
angles are preserved parallel lines and
lines are preserved and only straight
lines are preserved and if you notice
this is how we can go through and look
at different types
images from starting here looking at
translation rotation scale fine and
perspect projector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
