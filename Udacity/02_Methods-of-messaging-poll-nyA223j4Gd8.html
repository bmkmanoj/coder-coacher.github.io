the device you'll probably want to talk
to your app at some point and to do that
you'll need a server now I'm not going
to walk you through building a server
there are plenty of resources out there
for that instead I'm going to show you
how to communicate with your server so
let's focus on how to get data from your
server to your app the easy way which
you're already familiar with is known as
polling the server this is when your app
calls up the server just to see if
anything has changed with a repeating
alarm the app does this after a
specified amount of time both a sync
adapter it'll do it whenever the radios
turned on after some time has already
passed sorry let me just okay so by
waiting for the radio to be activated by
something else we can spare a bit of
battery life but that requires a
flexible timing schedule so you need to
determine what your priorities are when
choosing a polling method for example in
sunshine we pull the weather servers
every three hours give or take to keep
the weather data up to date an
alternative to polling would be pushing
with this method the server is
responsible for the messaging and will
inform your app when new data is
available your app doesn't need to
regularly check in with the server just
ok where was I oh yeah pushing Oh
pushing what a good idea all right so
pushing can happen in two ways either
the server can send a small message
called a tickle which says something has
changed and asked the app to sync edits
earliest convenience or the server can
just send the updated data directly to
the app and cut out the middleman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
