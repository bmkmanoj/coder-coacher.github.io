and as I mentioned at the beginning of
this course Carol is working in finance
and her job is to design algorithms that
will optimize financial investments so
given recent market thermals her
employer has asked her to come up with
an algorithm that will help them design
a secure portfolio of investments so the
problem that Carol is looking at is
actually quite similar to the one that
Bob is looking at she is looking at a
number of investment opportunities for a
company for example she could invest in
precious metals such as gold silver or
maybe even copper she could also invest
in stocks so for example a copper mining
company or in a silver and copper mining
company or she could invest in an
industrial manufacturer or also in some
other bank so in order for the portfolio
to be secure she wants to spread her
risk as much as possible so she doesn't
want to invest in things that are too
similar or too closely connected so for
example she wants to invest either and
gold or in silver but this line here
basically tells us that she doesn't want
to invest in both at the same time and
so she basically only wants to invest in
one of those precious metal if she
invests in copper she probably does not
want to invest in the mining company
because then if the copper price goes
down so will the stock of the copper
mining company similar here this is a
silver and copper mining so you either
invest in this company or in those
precious metals here if the industrial
manufacturer is actually a supplier to
this company here you probably wouldn't
want to invest in both of them at the
same time and let's say that the bank
down here is backing the two mining
companies so you either invest in the
bank but or maybe also these two mining
companies separately but you definitely
would not want to well actually let's
just say you also didn't want to invest
into mining companies at the same time
so in order to spread the risk as much
as possible Carol of course wants to
find a portfolio that can
as many different items as possible
because then she has spread out her risk
but at the same time she must observe
those rules so she cannot just select
all of these possibilities but only
possibilities that are not connected to
each other so in a way that is very
similar to Bob's problem because Bob
when he was looking at the genes he was
looking for jeans where every gene is
connected to every other gene and now
Carol is looking for possible
investments that are not connected at
all to each other so what is the largest
portfolio or how many items can Carol
select at maximum so that none of them
are connected I would like you to figure
that out as our next quiz and I would
like you to put your answer here in this
box please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
