be interested in checking for three exes
or three O's in a row which is when
someone wins here's an example of a game
in progress
so now grid 1 1 is equal to the
character X and grid 0 2 is equal to the
character oh and as the game progresses
the grid fills up with these two
characters here's a finished game with
three X's in a row vertically it's easy
for us to see that X's have one here but
how can you tell the tic-tac-toe program
to detect this win you'll have to check
the character value of the grid at the
indices 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 and you need to
check if they're all equal to the
character X and if they are like in this
case you can declare this a win besides
this win condition with three X's in
sequence there are a lot more to check
for OHS and for horizontal and diagonal
wins for your project you should cover
all these win conditions by helping to
complete a function called check game
winner and we've provided a little bit
of the code for you this function takes
in the 2d character array as a parameter
this is the grid that stores the
characters X 0 and the dash character it
also returns a string named result that
tells us who's 1 if you detect 3 X's in
a row the result string should be X wins
and this function should return that if
you detect three O's in a row then this
should return o wins
you should also handle the case where
the tic-tac-toe grid is full of X's and
O's but the game is a tie because there
are no places where X's or OS are three
in a row
and in this case return the string tie
and in any other case just return the
string none which is what this
incomplete code does right now
but before you get started on this code
let's look at how to check for one more
tic-tac-toe win condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
