content on Piazza what about posting
content to post a new thread click new
posts in the top left at the top you'll
select your post type when you're
posting a new topic it's really helpful
to select the right kind of post are you
asking a question that will have one
right answer like a due date or
clarification on directions then you
probably want to use a question are you
just sharing something or asking for
something with multiple good answers
like help solving a problem that's
usually better suited for a note or if
you want to ask a poll question you can
always just choose poll Piazza lets you
communicate privately as well you can
share your post with the whole class
with only a group you're a member of or
only with instructors next select the
folder your post will go into a single
post can go into more than one folder
then enter your title and post text
depending on your class you might be
able to choose to remain anonymous
although not all classes have this
option then click post my question and
your post will appear or you can save it
as a draft to return to later you'll see
a list of your dress at the top of the
topic list whenever you start to create
a new post
but for now I'll go ahead and post this
after posting you can edit the post by
clicking the edit button in the bottom
left you can also access other options
with the Actions menu in the top right
only instructors can delete posts but
you can change the visibility if you
post by mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
