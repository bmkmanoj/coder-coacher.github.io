first okay okay so let's see what's
going on here got our master object
festival and it's summarizing something
okay I magistrate summarizing attendees
oh so that's the only thing it's related
to exactly okay and roll up type count
I'm guessing that would tell me that
there were two that would count the
number of records okay which is not what
we want to do right we want to add up
the number of tickets sold yes okay this
is actually making sense feel to
aggregate tickets purchased yes yes but
only if their VIP tickets so what's
great is at the very bottom you can see
there you can create a filter criteria
okay all records should know only record
sir meeting certain criteria oh this is
easy okay field is take a type exactly
what's operator oh ok equals N equals
VIP yeah yeah sweet and you could do a
lot of different kind of calculations as
you could see so the minimum value the
maximum value some sort of aggregate and
you can get it to be pretty complicated
with your filters that's great so now
you have a count of your VIP tickets but
you probably won't one for general
admission to right we first I want to
see I want to see if this actually
worked i want to go to the cloud stock
and see if i can actually see this thing
hey it's pretty cool okay all right now
I'll do the same thing for the general
admission tickets right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
