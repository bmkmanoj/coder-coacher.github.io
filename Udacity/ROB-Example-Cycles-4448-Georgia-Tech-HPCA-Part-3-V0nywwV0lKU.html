sixth instructions result so this value
of 42 gets deposited in Rob six we mark
that is done we also broadcast the value
of 42 under the name Rob six but
nobody's waiting for anything so that
kind of ends the broadcasting of that
value another thing that happens in
cycle 44 is we're gonna look at this
instruction here and see whether it can
commit and yes it can we look at it
because it's the next instruction that
needs to commit and yes it can commit
because it's done so in cycle 44 we
commit this the way we commit
instructions again is take the value of
12 put it in register r1 next look at
the Rob entry for r1 and see whether
it's pointing to us it is not so we
don't update the right to point here
basically the rod still needs to point
here because that's still the most
recent value for our one that we will
have and then we can free this Rob entry
and the commit point moves here so next
cycle we will be looking at this to
commit in cycle 45 we will try to commit
this instruction it's done so we can we
take 3 put it in our 3 we check the Rob
entry for our 3 it does point to us so
we need to make rat entry for our 3
point back to the register 5 pretty much
from now on instructions that want to
read our 3 are actually going to find it
in the register file and now that we
have done that we can free this Rob
entry now we're ready to move to cycle
46 in cycle 46 we will try to commit
this instruction and it's ready to
commit so we can we commit it by writing
36 into r1 and we check the rat entry
for r1 is it pointing to Rob for it is
not so you don't change the rat and we
have freed this Rob entry this concludes
what happens in cycle 46 in psycho 47 we
will try to commit this instruction it's
done so it's ready to commit 47 is when
we committed we will deposit 33 into r4
we will check the rat entry for r4 does
it point to Rob 5 yes it does
now it needs to point to the register
file and we free this Rob entry now we
move to cycle 48 where we try to commit
this instruction it's done so it
commit we deposit 42 into r1 so the
final value of r1 is going to be 42 we
look at the rat entry for r1 is it
pointing to rob6
yes it is so finally the rat entry is
made to point to the register file so
only now instructions that want r1 are
going to start looking at the
architectural register file all the time
until now they would have found the
value in the robbed or they would have
had to wait for the value with this we
can finally free this Rob entry and this
concludes our example so pretty much the
last instruction is going to commit in
cycle 48</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
