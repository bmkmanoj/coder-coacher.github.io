of these procedures we need to change
crawl web we need to change add to index
and we need to change look up we don't
need to change get all links at all that
we can keep exactly the same as it was
it just returns the list of links it
doesn't depend on the index we don't
need to change add page to index this is
a little more surprising since it
depends on the index but because of the
way we wrote add page to index it calls
add to index so it doesn't depend how we
actually represent the index it's going
to go through all the words add them to
the index by calling add to index so we
don't actually need to change that code
we do need to change the other two so
let's start with crawl web and figure
out what we need to do to change this to
use a dictionary and the change is
actually going to be really small right
that index is here in the old version we
initialize index to a list to the empty
list and all we do with index is pass it
in to add page to index so to change
that to use a dictionary all when you do
is change the square brackets to be
curly brackets so now instead of
starting with an empty list we're going
to start with an empty dictionary so
that's the only change we need to make
to crawl web the change to add index is
going to be a little more complicated
and we can see from the code to crawl
web what happens with each page was we
call add to index passing in the index
which is now a dictionary let's look at
add page to index I claim that we didn't
need to change that here's the code for
add page to index and it takes the index
it goes through the words it adds eats
word to the index we can do this just
the same weather index was a list or
dictionary we don't need to change add
page to index we are going to need to
change add to index so we are going to
need to change the code to add to index
and let's try to figure out how so
before we had add to index that takes an
index a keyword and URL will still take
the same parameters but what we had to
do when it was a list was go through all
the entries in the index check for each
one if it matches the key word we're
looking for if we find that it does then
we add the URL if we get to the end
without finding it then we append a new
entry which is the key word with a list
of URLs containing just the first URL so
let's figure out how to change this to
work with the hash table index so the
great thing about the hash table
is we don't need to loop through
anything now we know exactly where it is
from the hash table with the dictionary
the built-in in operation gives us that
so instead of looping now we can check
right away if the keyword is in the
index so what's going to happen if we
found the key word in the index that
means that we can look it up this will
look up in the dictionary the entry that
corresponds to index that's going to be
the list of URLs that we have and so all
we need to do now is append to that
entry the new URL if it's not in the
index already well we need to do
something different what we did before
was we added a new element to the index
list using a pen we don't want to do
that now we want to add a new key value
pair to the dictionary so we're going to
do that by using the assignment and the
entry that we're adding is the list
containing just this URL so you can
delete everything else here add the new
entry to the keyword so this is a lot
simpler we have less code and it's going
to run a lot of faster we don't have to
loop through anything because of the
hash table we can right away look up
whether the keyword is in the index we
can find if it is what the value is by
using the dictionary lookup and we can
append the newer URL to the list of URLs
associated with that keyword if it's not
found we can create a new entry using
the dictionary syntax like this that
contains just that URL so now we've got
a much simpler way to add to index I
hope you understand this if you do you
should be able to define look up
yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
