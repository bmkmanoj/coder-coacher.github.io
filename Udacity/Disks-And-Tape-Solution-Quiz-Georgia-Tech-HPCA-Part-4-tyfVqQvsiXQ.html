and tape quiz tape can only efficiently
support sequential accesses we are
reading a large file from start to end
which is a sequential access so it's ok
to use tape however the disk will not do
too bad on that either if however we
want to read just the first and last
bite of a large file for tape we pretty
much have to fast-forward through the
entire file on tape so tape is not going
to do too well whereas on disk we will
seek to where the first and then where
the last byte is and just read it so
this will still work reasonably well
here because the disk is a so-called
random access medium meaning we give it
an address and it kind of goes there
with the tape it takes a lot longer to
get to any single position because we
need to really go past all the other
positions and finally a cat would much
rather play with a reel of tape then
with a hard drive and there are
thousands of YouTube videos that prove
this point cats like stringy things much
more than this key things especially if
the disk eating's are enclosed in a
metal rectangular box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
