I'm trying to represent in three
dimensions by showing the equator and
somewhere here we have CNA and somewhere
here and I'm going to exaggerate this
distance to make the drawing easier
we have Alexandria now to begin solving
this problem Eratosthenes did what
physicists often do when they're
tackling a really difficult problem
he made an assumption and now the
assumption that he made was that the Sun
was so far away
way way way off the screen that when the
sun's rays arrived at the earth they're
coming more or less parallel no matter
where on the earth you are now these
lines are parallel we assume they'll
never touch and why was this a safe
assumption to make well let's take a
look let's draw a little play a version
of the Sun over here and now this is
totally separate from what's going on
over here
and let's look at the sun's rays here
they are radiating outwards from the
center from the Sun and you can tell
that they're certainly not parallel but
what happens as we get really really
really far away from the Sun like way
out here well we've got more Ray's like
this we can start to see that if we're
really far away from the Sun maybe if
our earth is over here well in this
neighborhood that Ray's do look more or
less parallel they're not exactly
parallel they seem to be diverging a
little bit but maybe it's good enough
for for our purposes we'll examine this
more in the homework okay so we have our
rays arriving parallel at sea na and
Alexandria now what how am I supposed to
figure out the circumference of the
earth based on some parallel rays and
the observation that they're striking
vertically here at sea na well Before we
jump into the calculation of the
circumference let's try and understand
what's going on here first what we've
already talked about a person standing
here in CNA their shadow would be
directly below them because the sun's
rays are striking vertically here in
Alexandria a person would have a tiny
little shadow and you can see that the
angle from the head of the shadow to the
head of the person this line actually
follows the sun's ray we'll be using
that more later but for now let's think
if this person started walking north
closer to the pole up here what would
happen to a shadow
would he shadow lengthen as he walked
north or would it get smaller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
