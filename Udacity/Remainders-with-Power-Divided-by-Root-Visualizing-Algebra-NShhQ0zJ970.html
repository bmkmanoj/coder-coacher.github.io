power divided by root for each of our
factors so for x we'll have 7/3 for y
will have 5 divided by 3 and 4 z will
have 10 / 3 since 7/3 is to remainder 1
we'll have x squared on the outside and
x to the one on the inside of our cube
root for y will have 1y on the outside
and we'll have y squared left on the
inside and finally for Z will have Z
cubed on the outside and onesie on the
inside of our cube root this is our
final result we could have also
completely expanded this radicand once
we have all the factors listed out we
want to find the factors that appear
three times that means we can pull it
out here's a group of 3 x's and here's a
group of 3 x's so we can pull out an X
and an X we can also pull out one y and
we can pull out 3 z's these other
factors don't appear in a triple so we
leave them inside of our cube root X Y
squared Z and finally we just rewrite
the front part of our radical to get x
squared Y Z cubed times the cube root of
XY squared Z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
