strength and direction of linear
relationships we need a way to quantify
these characteristics the number that
quantifies the relationship is called
the correlation coefficient denoted by R
you've seen our before when we did T
tests this is also known as Pearson's R
named after a statistician as usual we
will describe the formula so let you
know what it is and we'll focus on
interpreting r r is a fraction just like
many of our other statistics the
numerator is the covariance of x and y
this is a function this does not mean
Kove or some number times X Y this is
the covariance of x and y which is in
itself a statistic for how much x and y
co vary in other words how much do they
vary together and the denominator is the
standard deviation of x times the
standard deviation of y and this
describes how the two variables vary
apart from each other rather than with
each other another way of writing it is
like this even though R is a ratio it's
not interpreted as a percentage however
r-squared is the percentage of the
variation in Y explained by the
variation in X you saw this before when
we did T tests and you saw how we
explained a certain percentage of the
difference between sample means or
between a sample mean and the population
mean that's due to the different
treatments our squared here has the same
interpretation our squared is called the
coefficient of determination our
measures the strength of a relationship
by looking at how closely the data falls
along a straight line if it falls
perfectly along a straight line in the
positive direction then R is positive 1
and if the data fall perfectly along a
straight line in the negative direction
R is negative 1 data that are not
correlated at all have a correlation
coefficient of 0 usually data will not
fall along a straight line but sometimes
it comes pretty close and then our
this case might have a correlation
coefficient of 0.8 which is actually
pretty high</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
