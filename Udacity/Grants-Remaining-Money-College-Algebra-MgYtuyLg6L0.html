probably felt quite new at the beginning
of this lesson you've actually been
doing it since the very first lesson of
this course they are we came up with an
equation for the amount of money that
grant has left at any given time
initially we said that the money grant
has left is equal to the money he got
from his venture capital fund errs minus
the total amount of money he spent so
far here we're using dollar amounts for
all these different quantities then
however we found out that money spent
changed as time passed then we got a
second equation showing that the total
amount of money spent is equal to the
money grant spends per month times the
number of months that have passed or the
number of months he's been in business
let's get some variables and numbers
back in here to make everything look a
bit cleaner let's say that the money
grant has left is called em and as we
knew before he started out with 3
million dollars from his venture
capitalists let's also give total money
spent a new knee like s well that looks
way nicer we can see that M is actually
a function of s it depends on us so I'm
going to change this left side of the
equation to read em of s but s itself is
a function of the number of months that
have passed since grant spends a set
amount of money per month that monthly
spending number was $100,000 so if we
say that number of months is just equal
to n then we have another function s
equals 100,000 n and actually since s is
a function of n we should rewrite this
side over here this should say s of n
making it a bundling clear that as n
changes as is going to change as well
take all this into account what do we
get for EM of s of n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
