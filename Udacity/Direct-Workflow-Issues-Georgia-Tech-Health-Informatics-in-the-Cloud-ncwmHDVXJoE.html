into the physicians workflow earlier I
showed you this and mention this share
button as well as automated import of
the data into the recipients EMR these
are examples of how a chai tea would
ideally be more finely tuned to support
efficient workflow absent them the
sending physician might have to export
the patient chart from their EMR start
up their email program find the exported
chart in whatever folder it was placed
attach it address the email and send it
that's pretty much the way you would
send an attachment using email all of
that except for addressing email by
selecting the intended recipient could
be automated after receiving in a
similar but essentially reverse process
could be avoided moreover were the
attached patient summary in XML as we
suggested earlier it could be parsed so
that for example Marla's blood pressure
pulse heart rate blood sugar level and
so on could go into the appropriate
fields in the recipients EMR savings
still more time and eliminating
potential sources of transcription error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
