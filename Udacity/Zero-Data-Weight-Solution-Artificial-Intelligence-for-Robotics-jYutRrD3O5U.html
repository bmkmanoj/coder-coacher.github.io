the reason is really subtle it's because
we're not modifying the first and last
point otherwise there would be a single
point so I just hit the Run button and
if you look at these coordinates they go
in point five increments from zero one
two three and four and the same is true
with us coordinate over here so this is
obviously the coordinates of a straight
line as a result of our smoother applied
with a smoothing weight of 0.1 and no
Darrell wait if you change this to no
smoothing wait we obviously get the
original path so if we look at the right
side what is the left side it's now
identical so when you implement your
algorithm please test is on those
settings it really will give you a
different path in our testing to see if
the algorithm is implemented correctly
so congratulations you just learn how to
produce a smooth path there's a few
caveats if you apply this algorithm in a
word world like this when a star player
might give you something like this the
smooth path might then lead straight
through the obstacle which you don't
want and there's ways to accommodate
this which is just him that finest tree
use dynamic programming with a
stochastic action function and you've
learned this in the previous homework
assignment Devon will stay away from the
obstacle and the second one is to
introduce a term that propels you away
from obstacles I won't go to any depth
fear but the new optimization you could
have a term that pushes you away from
obstacles by maximizing the distance
between the nearest obstacle and data
point when you toss that in you get a
path that might look more like this it's
still smooth but maximizes your
clearance to obstacles we will revisit
this in the homework assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
