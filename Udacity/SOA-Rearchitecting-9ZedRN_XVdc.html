often of interest at the enterprise
level that it's big corporations or
organizations who have a suite of
applications that they want to adapt to
internet type situations and rather than
rewriting the whole suite from scratch
they want to re-architect it into a
service-oriented configuration this can
be tricky as you might imagine anytime
you're dealing with large amounts of
code andrey architecting them you can
run into issues of reliability and
there's many a story of a lot of wasted
money leading to systems that don't work
as expected so in doing such riorca tech
ting ultimately you have to take code
that maybe was used to running on a
mainframe in which the code was
controlling its own fate it was in
charge control wise for calling the
various pieces if you have a service
oriented type architectures this over
the internet and it's intended to be
providing user functions then it may
have to be switched into a reactive type
system that is responding to the user
interactions this is a major change to
any system to do this the point I'm
making here is that there's a cost in
doing this and there's a high degree of
risk because of that cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
