as simple they obey something called
composability let me tell you a bit
about that if you recall how CUDA works
kernels launched into a given stream are
interdependent that means that in this
case for example B cannot run before a
is finished and C cannot run before B is
finished it's how kudos dreams work
which I think you've probably learned
about in a previous lecture so if B
creates its own work x y and z we call
this child work to be where B is the
parent of XY and z now composability
says that whatever B does is entirely
private to be that means C has no idea
and quite honestly doesn't care what B
is doing B is not considered to have
finished until all of its other children
x y&amp;amp;z in this case have also finished so
a B and C still execute in sequence as
expected and B follows the rules of
composability such that whatever B does
it has no effect on c's ability to
execute so in effect be actually looks
like a single kernel even though
internally it's doing all of these other
steps so it doesn't just stop here no
you can have child kernels launch their
own children P Q and R in this case for
example so you've got grandchildren of B
you can go on to generations of great
great great grandchildren if you like
until you run out of memory the point
being that it all composes and stacks
back into looking like it's a single
part of be and that's composability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
