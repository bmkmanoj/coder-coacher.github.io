problem and those of you I'm assuming
most of you are familiar this is
actually referred to as k-means
clustering it solves the chicken and the
egg problem by smashing them together
which could be a pretty nasty picture
but essentially it's just an iterative
algorithm what you do is just as it says
here and we'll take an illustration in a
minute you randomly yes just randomly
pick some cluster centers you might try
to be a little smart about how you do
that or not
I find it easier to be not smart and
then once you have the center's we know
which points should be assigned to those
clusters once we've assigned to the
clusters that's step two given the
points in clusters step 3 we can
reassign the center and you set that you
set the new cluster Center to be that
and step four is well if any of the
cluster centers moved and the only
reason they would have moved is because
you change the assignments you go back
to step two and this is classical
k-means I assume most of you have seen
that but just showing it to you in the
context of context of segmentation
here's a nice little example from Andrew
more recently appointed the Dean at
Carnegie own congratulations Andrew so
here we have k-means right so we got a
bunch of points now we know where we
think the clusters should be but that's
because we're smart the computers not so
smart we pick some random centers so
there they are not a particularly good
choice of initial collection we then
partition the space up right so those of
you from computer science recognize this
Voronoi diagram this is the the
fracturing of the of the space such that
this line says that everything here is
closest to that point more than any
other point and so once we have those
assignments what we can do is we move
the center's to be at the center of the
points that were assigned to that
cluster and then we iterate all right
and we repeat that until a terminate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
