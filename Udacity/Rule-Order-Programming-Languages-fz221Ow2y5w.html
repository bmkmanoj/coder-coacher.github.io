quite clear what to do when our token
definitions overlap the seven character
sequence hello surrounded by double
quotes matches our regular expression
for word but also matches our regular
expression for string this is a problem
not just with computer languages but
also with natural languages as the
hypothetical owner of this restaurant
would notice we don't just serve
hamburgers we serve people could be
interpreted the wrong way presumably
those hamburgers are soylent green
flavored so we want to have definitive
rules for figuring out which of these we
prefer in fact we're going to use a very
simple rule the first one you list wins
the one closer to the top of the file so
this is our big winner and is going to
take priority over string so if you're
making a lexical analyzer for HTML or
JavaScript ordering your token
definitions is of prime importance so
let's investigate this issue in the form
of a quiz suppose we have the input
string hello comma quoted string world
and we really want that to yield word
the word hello comma followed by a
string I'm going to list three rules for
you and I want you to tell me which one
has to come last for us to get the
desired effect and here because you've
seen it all before I'm alighting some of
the details like the colon Dogen blah
blah blah instead what I'd like you to
do is tell me which one of these
functions which one of these rules would
have to come last bearing in mind that
the one that comes first wins all ties
in order for hello comma world to break
down into a word followed by a string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
