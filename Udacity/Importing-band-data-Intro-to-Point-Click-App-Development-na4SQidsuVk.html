page layout in theory so now I can go at
a record yep but don't forget to click
Save because that's like the easiest
thing to forget and then it just loses
all your work okay I would never want to
do something like that
okay cool now all of these fields are
there but obviously they're not
populating yet so I just edit and I'll
fill out these fields ok so there's
gonna be a ton of bands coming to this
festival right I guess this is the
tedious part where I just have to enter
them all in or is there any other way we
can do this so you can save this record
but there's a really easy way to take
spreadsheets or more specifically CSVs
and put them into Salesforce using what
we call the custom import wizard let's
just go into the setup and then we can
import our CSV to load those records in
the Salesforce ok so I want to import
something say just search import up here
yeah don't try and memorize any click
paths let's just search for the import
there's a few import things which one
should I use import custom objects is
probably the safest bet okay I don't
trust anything in beta this time tells
you all the steps that you need in order
to be able to import custom objects but
we'll just walk through it ourselves
don't need to read all that text and we
have this CSV that you show them here
this spreadsheet right band spreadsheet
yeah so we have all of our fields along
the top and then each row represents a
record and if for any reason let's say
you spelled your fields different than
the way we have it up in the column
names or column headers we could just
manually match them it'll automatically
try and do it for you but if anything's
misspelled or anything like that you
could manually map them yourselves okay
cool so close this and start the import
wizard let's do it she was a type of
record you're importing that would be
banned do you want to prevent duplicates
from being created yeah I don't want to
bands with the same name right that's
right we want to make sure the band
names are unique okay got it
the existing records are found what do
you want to do there won't be so I guess
it doesn't really matter what this mean
what you use her feel that you including
well since we're not including any user
fields we can just leave it as default
or I guess we could put none
okay yeah and what about this which
lookup fields if any are included in
your import file
well our spreadsheet didn't have a stage
on it right right so I should not click
it yes yes I should not you should not
click it yes now we need to choose the
CSV file so look it up on your computer
and add in those those bands all right
and you can leave that as default okay
we haven't read any workflow rules so we
don't need to check that box okay field
mapping is that step you're talking
about where band name banding oh that
looks good yeah so it's mapped some of
them because they're exactly the same as
what they are in your CSV but for some
of them like has piano it's needs yeah
yeah okay so I'll go through and I'll
change those so we have she didn't add
special requests as a field in our in
our band object so can I just say ignore
those special requests yeah and again
same thing we expect to draw something
and it tells you there those values just
won't be imported that's fine we can
just click okay cool import now awesome
so it's basically just going to put it
into a queue
it'll import it when it can and then
you'll get an email when it's done cool
alright so we'll finish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
