in which people influences is authority
figures can sometimes get us to do what
we may not even want to do that is
obedience to Authority
now in fact one of the most famous
studies in all of psychology was on that
topic obedience to Authority and it was
carried out in the 1960s by the Yale
University psychologist Stanley Milgram
and Milgram was driven to understand and
ask the question how is it that Germans
can send so many innocent people to
their deaths
because the standard answer at the time
was well we were just following orders
so Milgram wanted to understand whether
Authority and obedience to Authority
could explain such a tragic event so
what do you think do you think obedience
to Authority could lead people to hurt
or even kill people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
