probably the biggest hurdle is getting
set up with github and if you're new to
get hub we encourage you to take our
intro to get and github course it's
really fun they did I love that class I
think Caroline and Sarah did a really
nice job it's been really helpful I
learned a lot actually me do you know a
lot of tricks about github and get but
get yeah I gotta get your git and github
account set up and then you're going to
fork the repo we have a starting point
for that resume and so you're going to
fork that and that creates a repo of
your own and that's on your github
account online and once you have that
repo online on your github account you
can clone it to your computer locally
yes tonight you have your local clone
and you can work on the code hopefully
and then push your changes back so no
purchase drove like Durant like to ask
you like why worship which what's what's
the point yeah so first we control often
if you want to be able to go back to an
old version of something you did before
maybe you're trying different branches
you can try a and Abby and you can work
on them individually you can switch back
and forth between them in the simplest
case where you even just have you know
just a single just a single revision
history you can go back to a previous
version let's say you like something
that you did before and you want to go
back to that you decided the new way the
test ways and what you want right go
back and especially the course they also
talked about how we're if there's a bug
that was introduced you want to go back
and find it figure out what that was you
can fix it and you can still keep the
whole history of everything you have and
move forward from there okay so and how
important is it for for you to learn
version control in the professional
world once we was working with other
people cuz yeah right it's good if
you're you know some there is an
argument it's a fair agreement then if
you're just working on your by yourself
you could just copy all files into a
folder and say okay this is x 0
version and I'm just copying thing to
another folder well I have another
version and won't work on right and
that's a good point especially because
when we're working with other people
version control will also track who made
what changes um there's something funny
called get blame where you can figure
out who introduced what into the stream
of edits so it's a it's really given
working within people to be able to
track all the different which is
versions of you know whether it's code
or even documents so you go back that's
pretty much a requirement working in any
kind of production environment with
other people and even by yourself if you
want to sort of have just a trail of
breadcrumbs just to sort of go back and
see what you did at what point you know
to basically rewind the clock to go back
in time to find older versions if you
know there's the only way to do it be to
like name files you know maybe like
version one version 2 so you have a very
cluttered directory structure these
tools make it really easy to first
create that trail so that you only see
the current files in that directory so
it keeps everything neat and compact in
your directory and then also makes a way
that you can share with other people
like through github right so that's
interesting guys let's talk more about
like only saving what neat you can get
purses cuz if you think about on
pershing the show you may be saying well
let me just save the whole version the
whole all the files one a tongue Oh
archive this folder like for yesterday
and then I'll copy all the files and
then I will also then make make my
changes and copy all the files again so
what's so difference between what give
up does and like if you were to do
everything manually right so one thing
especially now that you mentioning
multiple files that's something else is
incredibly important imagine you had two
different versions and the files had to
be consistent with each other so you can
save all these files together in one
batch or all the files together another
batch and you know you save them if you
save them to be consistent you can
switch back and forth between multiple
files at the same time right so you're
kind of like so get like it's one cool
thing is get it doesn't necessary save
all the file
it's age the differences yes right right
so if you if you think it was genius
it's very efficient so you don't care
about uh redundant uh lines of code if
you did not push that line of code get
doesn't care about it that's right yeah
only if you change certain lines of the
code get will keep track of those
changes yeah because it will assume that
if you have a section of the code that
you don't touch it it won't do anything
but it'll just assume that it will just
be there forever yeah it's super smart
that way and also you can view the
differences the young meat version so
instead of looking at these you know
ginormous files you can see like oh we
just changed these lines versus those
lines I'm really helpful for trying to
track down oh yeah this thanks for
giving us the overview of like what git
and github is impart inverse control
this particular tutorial is very helpful
and just understanding the basics of get
just the absolute high level of what
basic commands are and what you need to
know just to get started off the link is
editable I oh it will automatically take
you to the first level and the first
challenge um and I spoke about this
already now you can see it on my screen
you can see that there's it's got a
terminal it's got a virtual file system
that you can use just to see how hard
changes have you made so many shut off
the first thing you do is you want to
create a git repo on your system so that
is done by using the git init command
which is the initialization once you
enter that on your terminal you will see
that there will be a dot git folder that
will be generated and inside that you
will see a whole bunch of sub corners
branches hooks info objects you won't
have to make any changes to these these
are just used for the internal get
working and so anyone could get in the
future it will be here to be using all
these to make changes better than needed
so once you've created your git repo the
next step is to get started so get
status cata can reuse periodically
throughout your working with dick just
to see where your system eyes and what
you're working with right now
so many do get status you will see that
it tells you that you're on the master
branch and there's nothing to commit so
again rehydrating for sm previously the
branch that'll be on your system the
local branch is called master and your
remote branch will be called halogens
these are the default names so if you go
ahead and add the optic a dot txt file
as you can see or in the worship on
system if you if you add that into your
good folder and you do a git status
again it'll tell you that there is a new
folder I mean there's any file and that
it's it's an untracked file so gonna
find us on track what get is based Patel
you need to do is it means you commit
that file but before you do that it's
always good practice to stage it staging
or file is essentially just a medium
where you're confirming that the file
that you want to add on in care git repo
is the correct file and it has the right
changes so to do that we do get add the
name of the file and that will give you
the comments saying that the file is not
in the staging area again you don't get
status just to ensure that we're on the
right track yes so it tells us that the
get file that was added na needs to be
permitted so once the file has been
staged by using can add you'll git
commit so as you can see some work flow
goes from get in it then you get ad and
then good and then you could commit
again so you commit this file and you
see that it's been it's been added so
this is the basic steps that you need to
follow to ensure that the file that
you're working with gets added on to the
staging area and then and then gets
committed into your particular git repo
and then you know it's the same process
that goes over and over again like so
into virtual file system you will see
that if you add more files if you want
to stage all these files at the same
time you can do a git you can do a git
star get ad
star is a wild card that says that any
files that have the dot txt extension
can be added so I do that when that is
ensure that all the files that you've
added into your kit folder are now in
the staging area and then you can do the
exact same thing you can commit them to
ensure that they go from the staging
area into your git repo there you go so
so far we've seen get in it gets status
get ad and you commit um after this
there's another man called get lon a git
log is it's essentially if you want to
see more information for each commit you
can use git log you can see where any
files are added or where files were
deleted are all the basic medical
information so if i do a big log you
will see that every commit has a
particular code associated with it and
it tells you who the author was what
date it was and what changes for me to
each pie so this is I was just giving
you a quick brush through of this
particular tutorial you can go ahead and
use this it's not going to take you more
than say 20 minutes to actually go
through this entire tutorial it explains
how to work with remote repose how to do
a basic kit branch shall have your basic
it Marge let's just talk about a footer
to you know get in github k you cuz i've
also knows some people are confused
between getting it up ok all right let's
just talk about that cuz who then they
clarify some some questions that yeah
I've noticed on Piazza like yeah oh you
too right yeah yeah so yeah what someone
what is the difference between getting
github and you need one or two utter
can't use one without that yeah what's
what's the typical workflow if you're a
burgeoning things right so the
relationship is that kit is a software
that anyone can use a new can download
it's open source and you can host it
from any particular website that you
want github is a particular company
their business model is to host right
and select them to make some act tools
extra tools to make it easier for using
kit you can do everything on the command
line but with github they just have a
really nice interface for hosting your
projects and you're downloading
repositories that sort of thing right so
Lenny I'm to Durant's point just want to
drive this home github is just an online
server where you can just host your code
share your coat and collaborate gifts is
actually the system itself the actual
command line system that you will learn
in our Udacity course so there's just a
dry kontol relationship you what how
often developers write is they actually
developed locally under machine they use
git commands to commit save diversions
sick once and once they're um they're a
dad they want a sugar coat once there's
no once their code is not to actually
write a command called git push right
there they'll push they'll push this
code to github and from github you could
to share your coat and then github will
have supporting functions to be able to
help you collaborate with people so once
you share that people could then
download your your code onto their own
local machine and then they'll work on
it and then and if they say okay I have
this great okay addition to you know
your killer I'm gonna upload it to my
github and then I'm gonna submit what we
call a poll requests where we just merge
and say okay I think this is a really
good feature we should add it to the
main debate master the main code that's
how people work in a nutshell yeah and
I'll get github and even though your
github repositories I've heard people
say that it's almost a can almost be a
substitute for a resume or CV like
you'll just give someone like your
github you know repository and say you
know these are all my projects so look
at all look at all my projects and
project speak for themselves they look
your code you can ask you questions
about them you know yeah they'll ask you
questions and they'll also if you
collaborate online if you collaborate
with open source projects or other
projects they'll be able to see how you
work with other people online and how
you collaborate with other developers
and that's a very crucial skill exactly
looking at so yeah we highly encourage
you to start start your github account
and start using it and start being
comfortable with it because it will only
help you if you don't use get you forget
yeah you forget what what this is this
command you or you know I'm thinking
about it along merge this branch but
yeah I have I have I want to meet this
pass commit before I want emerging how
do I do it yeah I think it is a
complicated system but Sarah and
Caroline do a great job of clarifying it
and showing you some ferrets of real
world use cases for it so I definitely
also work your way through that Udacity
course it might be a struggle because if
it's new material it'll be hard to get
through but it's it should certainly
help me though awesome blow up fish that
we found someone just program an
interactive practice tool like little
tool to practice with get and let's
let's just look at a good commit git
commit let's do it ok so i click git
commit and here's a little diagram and
there's master and head and if I just
get commit and on git commit again you
can see the diagram updating and master
and head move along with the head yeah
so it gives you a visual representation
of actually what's going on with your
versions because just think of every
circle as a version of your whole entire
project yeah so every circle is a commit
AKA is just a version that you say it's
a snapshot of the past basically and
this basically you can think about get
as a time machine capsule you go launch
all these commands to manage this time
machine so basically if you everyone
watches daughter who is calling like
your TARDIS said most part is turned on
in the software development world and
the github is the ability to see
everyone else's TARDIS and get the taxes
there there of brush control York admits
under us Coca street yeah so play it
play around with this as you're learning
the commands as you're going through the
course just come back to hear this web
page and I will actually dynamically
build this diagram for you so cool works
ffs tempah to the rest of us today
