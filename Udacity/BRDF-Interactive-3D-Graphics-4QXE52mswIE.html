materials can be represented in a more
general way you'll also learn a great
term to impress your friends and
confound your enemies think about a
surface and how it reflects light the
two variables we use are the lights
incoming direction and the amount of
light reflecting towards the eye so at
its simplest a material can be
represented by this function given a
light and eye direction give back in
intensity this function is called the
brdf which stands for bi-directional
reflectance distribution function let's
look at that phrase first it's a
function the inputs are the light in the
eye the function depends on two
directions so it's bi-directional these
directions are normally given with
respect to the surface itself that is
each vector is often given as two
numbers the altitude angle and the
azimuth the altitude is the angle away
from the normal and the azimuth is the
angle of the vector when projected onto
the plane
the phrase reflectance distribution
means how the light is spread one simple
example is a perfect mirror the
reflectance distribution in this case is
that when the eyes Direction is exactly
equal to the lights reflection direction
all light is reflected towards the eye
every other eye Direction gets no light
another basic distribution is diffuse
reflection for some given incoming light
direction the direction to the eye
doesn't matter that's the definition of
diffuse reflection since this value is
constant diffuses then represented by
the surface of a hemisphere specular
highlights are represented by lobes this
distribution represents a glassy surface
where light is reflected in a general
direction the light's direction
determines where most of the lights
energy is reflected if the lobe gets
wider the specular reflection spreads
out written this way our brdf needs four
numbers - for the light and - for the
eye but if you think about it most
materials really only need three these
two altitude angles and this azimuth
between them for example if you put a
sheet of paper on a tabletop and rotate
it both the light azimuth and I azimuth
angles change with respect to the paper
but the angle between the two remains
the same most materials are fine with
three numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
