direct-mapped cache 'as in that
different blocks that are important to
your application might get mapped to the
same index in the cache for instance of
an application happens to access to
cache lines that have the same index
maybe this one and this one here then
they will constantly be evicting each
other from the cache and it will be
essentially useless this of course is
rather silly given that there are all
these other entries in the cast that
aren't getting used at all the
fundamental problem is that the address
any one of these here is only associated
with one location in the cache we can
mitigate these effects by associating at
an address with more than one block in
the cache one strategy is to treat all
of the red lines as blue ones and all of
the orange lines as green ones if we do
this then we'll have twice as many
places in the cache to store a blue line
of memory actually it's more convenient
to think about the blue lines in the
cache being together and in this way we
can say that we have simply decided to
ignore the most significant bit of our
previous index but to allow a cache
block to now be stored in two possible
places hence this would be called a
2-way associative cache the downside is
that we have to check two tags now to
see if we have a cache hit but we are
less likely to run into the problem
where we are constantly evicting the
memory we need from the cache if we
decide this isn't good enough we can
have the number of indices again to
create a 4-way associative cache
returning to our general notation we now
say that we have two to the j
associativity this means that we only
have to the k- j indices into our cache
and the index is really only K minus J
bits long now this greater associativity
also gives the cache some choice about
replacement whereas with the direct
mapped cache there was only one block in
the cache where the data could be stored
we now have a set of possible locations
just too in our example but maybe more
typically we choose to evict the entry
that was least recently used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
