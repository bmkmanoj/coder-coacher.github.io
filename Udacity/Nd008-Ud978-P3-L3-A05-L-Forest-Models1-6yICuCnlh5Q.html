technique but like all techniques the
algorithm can have its issues decision
trees are prone to an era called
overfitting where the model fits the
sample data a little too well and as a
result does not predict future results
as well as it should a technique that
helps eliminate this issue is the random
forest model let's go over a little
background of what a forest model
actually is to build on a forest model
let us start by building a decision tree
if you recall the decision tree is
constructed by looking for groups to
split our data splits are chosen at
places to produce the largest difference
and for this example the largest
difference in two percent of the mode of
transportation we will continue down
this path creating different splits of
the data until adding more splits no
longer adds value in predicting the
correct mode of transportation now what
if we made the same tree with slightly
different data would it be exactly the
same no changes in the data could cause
the tree to split at different points or
in a different order a forest model
creates hundreds of trees this is called
an in Samba of decision trees where each
tree is created by different randomly
generated chunks of the original data
then it looks at the results as a whole
to make a prediction so how does this
fix the overfitting problem we mentioned
before well each individual tree created
still has the overfitting issues but
when you look at the result as a whole
the overfitting gets averaged out by all
the other trees the first decision tree
will be created with a subset of the
original data it will also use a
different combination of predictor
variables to assist with the splits
along the trees the second decision tree
will then do the exact same thing with a
different subset of data with different
predictor variables being used to help
with the splits as well this will
continue to occur until the number of
decision trees specified has been
created by default this value is 500
decision trees now each employee will
traverse through each tree until it
reaches a terminal node at each of the
term Ono's that
and tree casts a boat-car public transit
or bike the terminal node that has seen
most often is then classified as the
group that employee falls within</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
