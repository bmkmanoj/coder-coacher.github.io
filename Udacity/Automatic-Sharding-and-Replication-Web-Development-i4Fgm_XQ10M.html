the fact that that a store is sharded in
some way and you know replicated Google
doesn't really share details of how this
is implemented at a very low level but
you know a lot of the constraints that
we'll be dealing with imply that the
database is both charted and replicated
you know so there's some really nice
properties here one is that you're not
going to have to think about scaling too
much your queries will generally be
quick because they have to be simple and
we might have to think about consistency
which is why I talked a little bit about
replication lag so much before in an
intro class you know because things are
charted and sometimes your data changes
and updates take time to propagate
through the system we're going to
actually have to acknowledge the fact
that we're in a big database system and
things may not always be consistent in
all cases it's easy to work around these
cases but it is something you have to do
consciously let's do a quick quiz do you
understand everything there is to know
about the App Engine data store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
