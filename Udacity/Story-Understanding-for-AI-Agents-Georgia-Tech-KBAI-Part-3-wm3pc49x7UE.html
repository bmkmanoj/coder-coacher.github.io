metaphor of human-computer interaction
and thinking about how humans might be
able to interact with machines in the
form of stories but imagine a slightly
different scenario imagine intelligent
agents living among humans as they
interact with humans and as they
interact with the world of humans they
are not likely to have all the events
come to them in a nice coherent order
one by one instead they are like you to
have any went one and then later an even
two and they will be expected to make
connections between them how can we make
air agents that can make this causal
connection between evens so to take an
example of this you might be familiar
with a Roomba which is an autonomous
vacuum that vacuum is the floor on its
own without being pushed around by a
human you might be able to imagine an
ultra advanced Roomba they can just sit
in the corner until it receives some
kind of input that suggests it's needed
for example it might hear a sudden crash
and someone yell for paper towels it
might hear those two things which on
their own are not really a story but
it's built with the knowledge to be able
to infer something was just spilled and
therefore i'm probably needed right now
that's a good story David let us
consider a different set of issues
imagine that I told you a story Bob went
to a restaurant and sat down but nobody
came to serve him for quite a while
eventually when someone did appear he
ordered a hamburger the hamburger took a
long time before it came and when it did
come it was burned bob was not very
happy he didn't even finish the
hamburger getting Bob left a large tip
well I expect most of you will say no it
did not leave a large tip if you had to
wait for a long time and if the food
that came eventually was not a very high
quality you probably would not leave a
large tip but how did you come to that
answer why did he expect it in this
particular case Bob will not leave a
lost it again this connects to your
notion of a story it can actually a
notion of a story of what happens in a
restaurant why do people live tips when
do they leave them to put it another way
stories help you make sense of the world
they help you generate expectations even
before events occur they allow us to
make connections between events that
otherwise might appear disparate so in
this lesson we'll look at another
structured knowledge representation
called scripts
for representing stories of the kind
that we are talking about and we'll see
how this knowledge representation allows
us to make sense of the world and answer
the kind of questions that we are
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
