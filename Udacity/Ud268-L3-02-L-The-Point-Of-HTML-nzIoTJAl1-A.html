this point everything we've built has
been a bit visually underwhelming our
routes respond with basic black and
white plain text which doesn't really
make for the most exciting applications
but the problems with plain text go
beyond styling it's not just that it's
unusable totally embarrassing boring sad
disgusting what what was was that just
the entire Ruby team yeah you going more
important than it just being ugly plain
text is just plain lacking and
functionality it's just text but in
reality there's so much more to a
typical web page than text what about
images links list buttons forms videos
tables hey I have an idea let's imagine
for a moment living in a sad sad world
where all websites just respond with
text you probably don't think this world
to get more depressing but you just wait
here's what the Google News homepage
looks like when we extract the plain
text content imagine if this is what you
saw when you visited google news in your
browser it's impossible to read and even
if you could read it easily there are no
links to click or images to view and
this is what Facebook looks like it's
completely unusable but on a more
positive note I might actually get some
work done but what we really need is a
standardized way of marking up this text
to give it some structure so that my
browser could render a beautiful and
usable page ah much better so HTML or
hypertext markup language is a system
for marking up text content and breaking
it into different components or elements
it's a way of describing the structure
of our content and it gives context and
meaning to our information if this is
our plain text content for a web page
HTML is what allows me to specify that
this bit of text should be a header and
this bit of text should be emphasized
and this word right here should actually
be a link to the contact us page
HTML is what allows our pages to go from
looking like this to this beautiful page
well this is just the raw HTML content I
still think it's beautiful though but
remember it's up to browsers to take
this underlying HTML response and render
it beautifully for us humans to read and
waste countless hours of our lives on
now let's see some of the ways we
configure Sinatra to respond to the HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
