computer based solution so to check what
the computer does the easiest way to
learn what goes wrong with a computer
simulation is to use a toy example which
we can compute by hand as well at this
tile example will be a circular orbit a
spacecraft moving around earth for
instance with the earth at the center of
his orbit it's called the radius of that
orbit our and that's called the orbital
period the time it takes for one orbit
kapiti the velocity vector of that
spacecraft will be tangential to that
orbit and the speed that is the length
of that velocity vector the speed will
be constant and we can easily compute
the speed it takes the spacecraft amount
of time capital T to go around that
circumference in the time capital T the
distance travelled by the spacecraft is
to PR the circumference of that orbit
the acceleration vector always points
perpendicular to that orbit the center
of the earth the acceleration does not
change the speed the length of the
velocity vector that is it simply
changes the direction of that vector we
can compute the length of that
acceleration vector in a similar fashion
this goes as follows we start with a
velocity vector that takes us up and
then we move and then the velocity
vector changes to the left at this point
it points to the left and eventually it
goes round full circle after one orbital
period it's going to be that blue vector
again with a phase shift of 90 degrees
so we can say that the velocity vector
execute the same circular motion as dust
the position vector but we have a phase
shift of 90 degrees between them
nonetheless we can still apply the same
equation it takes us one orbital period
to make one full revolution and that has
a length of two pi times this
eat all of these vectors have a length
of 2 pi r divided by T so the
circumference would be two pi times this
video's two PI R divided by T which
boils down to two pi squared R divided
by T squared so given the radius and the
orbital period of that circular motion
we can determine what the speed is and
what the acceleration is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
