the difference between the terminal and
the shell the terminal is a program that
draws text in the window and lets you
type some things in on a keyboard
technically it's called a terminal
emulator since it acts like one of those
old-school hardware terminals it
displays output on the screen and it
accepts input from the keyboard but the
terminal itself doesn't know what to do
with that input it needs another program
to do that in this case that program is
the shell when you type things in the
terminal just sends what you type to
that separate program when you press
Enter the shell interprets what you
wrote as a command figures out what
program you want to run runs it and
since the output back to the terminal so
you can see it you can actually use the
terminal without the shell with a lot of
terminal programs you can tell it what
program to run the default is a shell
but you can have it run say the Python
interpreter instead also there are
actually a lot of different shell
programs that you can choose from the
default one on most Linux systems and on
the Mac it's called the new bash but
there are others called tcsh ksh and z
shell they all work slightly differently
and have various different features for
this course we're just going to stick
with bash and you can also use a shell
without the terminal sort of you can
write shell commands into a file and
arrange to your computer to run the
shell program on that file this is
called shell scripting it's a bit of an
advanced topic and we won't go into it
in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
