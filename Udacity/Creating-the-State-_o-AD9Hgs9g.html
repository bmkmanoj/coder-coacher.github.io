we're doing here is that our state is a
single number it's an integer that way
we can address it in a table in our cue
table it is certainly the case that some
reinforcement learning methods are able
to treat the state as a continuous value
but just to get started here let's use
state as an integer so we can work more
easily with the data now we have to do a
little bit of work to get our state to
an integer and here is the general way
to do it our first step is to discretize
each factor it's a weird word I'll
explain it in a moment but it
essentially means convert that real
number into an integer next is to
combine all of those integers together
into a single number we're assuming that
we're using a discrete state space and
that means more or less that our overall
state is going to be this one integer
that represents that once all of our
factors so consider that we have four
factors and each one is a real number
now we have separately beforehand
figured out how to discretize each one
of these factors so we run each of these
factors through their individual
discrete eyes errs and we get an integer
now I've happened to select integers
between 0 and 9 but you can have larger
ranges you know for instance 0 to 20 or
zero to a hundred even it's easy if we
just go from 0 to 9 because then we can
stack them together into a number but
it's not too hard to think of algorithms
to enable you to combine larger ranges
of integers together in this case we're
just able to stack them one after the
other into our overall discretized state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
