solution that the agent can come up with
because Bucharest doesn't appear on the
map and so the agent doesn't know any
actions that can arrive there so let's
give the agent a better chance now we've
given the agent the full map of Romania
the start is in Arad and the destination
or gold is in Bucharest and the agent is
given the problem of coming up with a
sequence of actions that will arrive at
the destination now is it possible for
the agent to solve this problem and the
answer is yes there are many routes of
course steps or sequences of actions
that will arrive at the destination
here's one of them starting out in Arad
taking this step first and then this one
then this one then this one and then
this one to arrive at the destination so
that would count as a solution to the
problem it's a sequence of actions
chained together that are guaranteed to
get us to the goal now let's formally
define what a problem looks like a
problem can be broken down into a number
of components first the initial state
that the agent starts out with in our
route finding problem the initial state
was the agent being in the city of Arad
next a function actions that takes a
state as input and returns a set of
possible actions that the agent can
execute when the agent is in this state
in some problems the agent will have the
same actions available in all states and
in other problems they'll have different
actions dependent on the state in the
route finding problem the actions are
dependent on the state when we're in one
city we can take the routes to the
neighboring cities but we can't go to
any other cities next we have
a function called result which takes as
input a state and an action and delivers
as its output a new state so for example
if the agent is in the city of Arad and
takes that would be the state and takes
the action of driving along Route Yee
671 towards Timisoara then the result of
applying that action in that state would
be the new state where the agent is in
the city of Timisoara next we need a
function called goal test which takes a
state and returns a boolean value true
or false telling us if this state is a
goal or not in the route finding problem
the only goal would be being in the
destination city the city of Bucharest
and all the other states would return
false for the goal of test and finally
need one more thing which is a path cost
function which takes a path a sequence
of state action transitions and returns
a number which is the cost of that path
now for most of the problems we'll deal
with will make the path cost function be
additive so that the cost of a path is
just the sum of the costs of the
individual steps and so we'll implement
this path cost function in terms of a
step cost function the step cost
function takes a state an action and the
resulting state from that action and
returns a number n which is the cost of
that action
in the route-finding example the cost
might be the number of miles traveled or
maybe the number of minutes it takes to
get to that destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
