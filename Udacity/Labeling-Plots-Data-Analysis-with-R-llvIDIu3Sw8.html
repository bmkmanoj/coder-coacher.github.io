do want plots to speak for themselves if
you look back at some of the plots we've
created you'll notice that the labels on
the x axis and the y axis are
automatically generated by default
ggplot2 uses the variable names for the
labels that's why we can see that
ten-year divided by 365 appears right
here we pass that to X so that's gonna
appear in our graph now this might not
be the best label for the x axis so
let's change this to do so we can use
the X lab in Y lab parameters now making
sure I have a comma after each of these
new parameters I can run this code and
see the labels on my plot yeah that's a
lot better now your x axis might look
slightly different from mine and that's
because I added scale X continuous as a
layer and I made the brakes go from zero
to seven that's what this bit of code
does here now when you conduct EDA your
plots don't need to be perfect I don't
want you to stress about formatting but
do focus on making sensible choices for
scales and limits on each axis when you
return to your plots and to your code
later labels can function as comments
about what the code was intended to do
likewise if you are to share a plot with
a colleague labels can make your plots
more understandable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
