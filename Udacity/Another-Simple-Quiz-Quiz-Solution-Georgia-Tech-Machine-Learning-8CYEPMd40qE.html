let's go across all right across so the
first row it's all left left but the
second left doesn't matter cuz that's in
state four oh it might matter I take it
back
so left left you did was seven left and
then player 2 goes to medium middle that
would be three so then the payoff is
three mm-hmm if the first player does
left left and the second player does
right right then we're gonna go left
right left again or 4-1 mm-hmm oh wait
hang on left right left
yes uh-huh yeah the next row should be
exactly the same as this one except for
in that third case so it should be seven
three and the are the difference they're
the are and four only matters in this
case where we've gone to the right state
and four right action from state two and
so that should give us a plus four so
four correct so far all right halfway
there so all right now now we've got
something different so now player one is
going to the right so now actually
player ones choice in state four never
matters so the next two rows are going
to be identical to each other and so in
the first case Oh actually huh
all these numbers are gonna be identical
to each other so so player one goes
right player or sorry player a goes
right player B has to go right there's
no choice so we're gonna get two's no
matter what now so it's gonna be two two
two and then the second row will repeat
that two two two okay so there you go
Michael you are correct you can feel
very good about yourself very good very
good
so you're right Michael we do have we do
have this nice little matrix and we have
these numbers and you know what's really
interesting about this that we can
figure out what the payoffs are for B
without having to do any additional work
that's true but it's even more
interesting than that which is now that
I've written down this matrix nothing
else matters this whole tree all these
rules it matters it's irrelevant
okay because everything about the game
is captured here in this matrix this is
actually called the matrix form of the
game and it comprises everything you
need to know about it it doesn't matter
what it means to go left or right or
what it means to go middle or whatever
the point is by following this strategy
and this strategy you end up with seven
for a this strategy and this strategy
you end up with two for a period and how
you got there does not matter but it
does creep me out a little bit that what
you're saying is that all that matters
is the matrix you know we should mind a
movie about that I think it's been done
and it's scary well not the first one it
was kind of scary
like people are trapped in this big box
and they're slur penis but they're happy
but they don't know they're happy
what do you mean they'll know they're
happy but it needs to be Mike okay
speaking of which now how do we how do
we figure out what what do we do with
this now so that's the big question
right so what was the whole point doing
reinforcement learning the whole point
doing reinforcement learning was to try
to optimize your long-term expect your
reward right and so you pick the policy
that would get you to the best place
possible so here's a question I have for
you given that this is everything we
need to know this little matrix of
values these are all the policies a
could choose from we're calling them
strategies here but you know strategies
policies there are four a can choose
from and there are three B can choose
from what will you think a and B
actually do okay so you know a once the
rewards to be high so seven is the
highest so they should choose the upper
left corner but they can't choose the
upper left corner why a can only choose
a strategy B gets to choose its own
strategy
I see so a is choosing the row and then
B gets to choose the column so then B
should choose that also cuz that's what
a one's know B wants to maximize what B
gets and remember he always gets the
opposite of a because it's a two player
zero-sum finite game of perfect
information deterministic of something
so so you're saying that if we if a
chooses the first row so this is the
left left strategy then B now has a
choice between three values and we'll
choose the one that is worst for a which
would be the minus one so that would be
a terrible thing to do
yep okay then so then what if a chooses
the second row
okay they choose in a second room so now
again B is not gonna let him have that
seven which is kind of sad but but still
can't make too bad for a so it like B
would choose the middle right strategy
and then that would be a three for a a
minus 3 for B but wait hang on so that
was done thinking of it as a mu a kind
of making the choice first mm-hmm that
doesn't seem fair
okay well then do it the other way all
right so if B chooses first then B could
choose the far right column because
that's where the minus one is that's
where it's gonna be happiest CB seems
kind of kind of mean it's like it's
happiest when others are suffering well
but a is also happiest when others are
suffering I see so so if B chooses that
column then a wants to choose the second
row and get to four yep so B could
choose the middle column yeah which then
a would choose a two they would they
would choose what one of the twos that
one of the bottom two rows no he
wouldn't oh right he's trying to
maximize so he would choose one of the
top two rows oh yeah that makes more
sense right into two three which is
better for B than having chosen the far
right and being confused the far left
column but then a would choose one of
the sevens and B would be unhappy with
that so we'd end up with B choosing the
middle column and a either choosing the
top or the second row mm-hmm so that's
kind of the same answer we got the other
way yep that's exactly right and is that
was that just luck or did you make this
example to make that happen
no I didn't make this example to make
that happen in fact the process you went
through is exactly the process you would
expect to go through and you'll always
end up with the with the same answer for
a two player zero-sum game you know
deterministic finite all those other
words the process you just went through
is exactly the process you would expect
to go through so let's see if we can if
we can be a little bit more you know
explicit about the process you went
through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
