robust madlibs generator now if there
are other words we want to prompt our
user to fill in the blanks for all we
need to do is add the word to our list
parse of speech and our mad libs
generator will work as expected however
there's one last step we need to take in
order to build the mad libs generator
you saw Andy and I play in the beginning
of stage two which is to replace the
words that are found in parts of speech
with user input rather than the word
Corgi now like I said we'll just have to
add one line of code to do this which
we'll do by using a function called raw
input here's an example of the raw input
function if we were to run this line of
code we'd be prompted with the message
type in a word if I follow those
directions by typing in let's say
Udacity and then press ENTER on my
keyboard user input will now be set to
the string Udacity simple enough so the
string you put in parenthesis is the
prompt the user or player will receive
and whatever they type on their keyboard
followed by enter will be the variables
value will use raw input in our mad libs
generator by prompting a user for the
part of speech we want them to fill in
the blank for and use that as a
replacement instead of quarry but where
in our code do we use this so if this
was the part of my code that replaces
the part of speech with Corgi which you
built in the last quiz my code will now
look like this by adding this line of
code and by swapping a string Corgi with
the user input we now have a fully
functioning Mad Libs generator in the
download section there will be a file
that contains all the code you've
written up until now including this
added line raw input about it a few
strings near the top of the file that
you can play around with but I encourage
you to write your own MATLAB sentences
add your own words to the parts of
speech list and run your Mad Libs
generator on them the following videos
will step you through the process of
running this program locally so you can
play mad libs with your friends and
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
