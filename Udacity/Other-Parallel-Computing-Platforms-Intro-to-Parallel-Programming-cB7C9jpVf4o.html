isn't just a specific language or a set
of extensions to the C C++ language CUDA
is the whole GPU computing architecture
so let's talk about some other platforms
that support CUDA first we'll talk about
other languages that support CUDA and
we'll talk about cross-platform
solutions so the lightweight version of
targeting CUDA is simply to wrap CUDA
C++ into the other language so that you
can transfer data to the GPU and call a
CUDA C++ kernel from within the other
language and a great example of this is
PI CUDA which allows Python programs to
call CUDA C++ kernels and even to
construct them programmatically from
within Python at a deeper level an
increasing number of languages are
directly targeting the cuda architecture
so fans of Python will also want to
check out copperhead copperhead is a
data parallel subset of Python that uses
a library of data parallel functions
such as Map Reduce filter scan and sort
when a copperhead function is called the
runtime generates thrust code and calls
it from the Python interpreter memory is
managed by the Python garbage collector
and lazily transferred to and from the
GPU so a cool thing about copperhead
programs is that they interoperate with
Python programs using packages like
numpy or matplotlib and this makes it
easy to write entire applications and
not just kernels CUDA Fortran is a
product from the Portland group that
does exactly what it sounds like it
integrates CUDA constructs such as
thread blocks and shared memory directly
into the Fortran language more on the
research front halide is a brand new
language specifically designed for image
processing this makes it a DSL or
domain-specific language and it's a
really cool example of this halide
targets GPUs as well as multi-core CPUs
on both desktops and on mobile devices
and many of the parallel optimization
patterns we've discussed such as tiling
are particularly easy to express and
optimize and halide and that makes it
possible to get very high performance
image processing code finally the widely
used MATLAB platform supports CUDA both
for wrapping CUDA kernels as well as
directly targeting CUDA with MATLAB code
and core functions let's talk about
MATLAB a little further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
