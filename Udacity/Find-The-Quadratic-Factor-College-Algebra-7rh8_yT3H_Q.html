this problem or just simplifying the
left-hand side rather was to go through
and multiply every term from the first
set of parentheses by every term in the
second set of brackets but that way we
end up with this really really long
polynomial and it does reduce but it's
not very pretty so I'm going to show you
a different way of thinking about this
multiplication we can start off by
distributing this negative sign to each
of the terms inside this inner set of
parentheses we can do this for both of
the sets of brackets now this is pretty
interesting you see that we have X minus
2 here and X minus 2 here why do we see
if we can just consider those as a unit
and see what happens at this point we
can recognize that we're going to end up
with a difference of two squares as our
final polynomial let's see that happen
since we have an X minus 2 in both of
these expressions and then opposite
signs of negative 3i and positive 3 I
hear we end up with X minus 2 squared
plus 9 notice I've already multiplied
the eyes together and switch the sign
multiplying out this Square and adding
the nine gives us a final polynomial of
x squared minus 4x plus 13 equals zero I
think this is a pretty cool trick
definitely saved a lot of space and a
lot of writing for me and you know I
always love ways to be a little bit more
