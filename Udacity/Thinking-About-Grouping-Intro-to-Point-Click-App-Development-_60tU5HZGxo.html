first because I'm when I think about
this it's thinking like hi tickets are
sold this month and then within that
month how are those tickets distributed
how many were each and you're right you
should be grouping by date first because
that's the overarching categorization
okay so grab the purchase date field and
then drag it above ticket type oh cool
yeah but the thing right now with
purchase date isit's every day and we
don't want that we want to do it by
month right so if we click that arrow
and then group by dates or group dates
by calendar month alright so October
head 21 of which is VAP that's awesome
ok so again this is just a preview so
don't freak out of it doesn't show all
of the records because I know sometimes
people do okay should I hits saving and
yeah click Save oh wait save as yeah
that was close okay um total revenue
over time yeah I'll say bye monkey Oh by
month yeah saving run save and run oh
that's so cool so we've got may 2013 we
had 14 VIP tickets and 17 general
admission jun a lot of people about
tickets all right this is very cool so
now when I mean I want to make a chart
we're fooling around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
