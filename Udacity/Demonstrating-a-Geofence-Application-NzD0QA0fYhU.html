at a simple app that uses geofencing you
can see it here and it's very simple
indeed I've created a geofence for the
location that I'm in this is a studio in
Mountain View California and I've
created with a radius of a mile
I ran the application before I drove
into the studio today and then once I
got within a mile of the studio a
notification was fired and you can see
the notification icon in the tray here
and when I swipe it down it says I've
entered Udacity Studios or I've entered
like that geofence of audacity now where
I to leave this one mile radius on my
way back to my hotel tonight I would see
a notification for me having left now of
course you don't have to use your
notification tray you could have your
activity do anything in response to a
geofencing event the nice thing about
using the notification tray is now if
I'm in my general desktop for my Android
tablet the notification is still there
so I was traveling and it showed that I
entered the geofence that I want and
then when I touch that it relaunches the
application so we're going to see next
how to build this application and how to
use notifications within a geofence
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
