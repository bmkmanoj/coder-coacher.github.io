MongoDB collection and do queries
against that collection now what I'd
like to talk about briefly is how to
remove documents from a collection where
that's necessary so the syntax for
removing documents is actually quite
similar to the syntax for finding
documents so with find we want to return
all the documents in the collection we
simply don't specify any parameters to
the find function the same is true with
remove if i were to execute this query
it would remove one by one all of the
cities from this collection a more
efficient way of doing that would simply
be to call drop which would remove the
entire collection and any metadata
associated with it such as indexes now
we can also remove individual documents
or documents matching particular
criteria so for example I could remove
an individual document with a name
matching the value Chicago so let me
first do a find and there we see that
single city and now a remove and then
find again and sure enough that city's
gone from this collection now let's look
at a query that touches more than one
document so in this case what I want to
do is identify all documents that
actually don't have a name okay you can
see there are several returned in fact
210 documents in the city's collection
may seem odd don't actually have a name
this is a good example here we've got a
country but no name for the individual
city same is true with the rest of these
returned now as part of a cleaning pass
for example we might want to remove all
cities from this collection after
they've been put into the database all
cities that don't actually have a value
for the name field I can do that by
sending this same query document to the
remove function so now I've removed all
of those cities that have no name and if
I do a find again I can see that there
are now in fact no cities that are
missing a name field so the takeaway
here is that remove works in a way very
similar to find you can specify the
documents to be removed using a query
document that has the same syntax and
operators available as does the find
function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
