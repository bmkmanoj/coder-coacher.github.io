series of Udacity talks we invite
innovators and inventors from Silicon
Valley accomplished people to talk to us
into our students worldwide today it's
my great honor to have with me my good
friend Tony Fadell CEO and founder of
nest the inventor of the ipod and many
other wonderful things to come and join
us in US and mostly answer your
questions as i get them online from you
in this session and here's the first one
from a student named Lucas how do I know
when to leave everything behind and
follow my dream it's very broad sure you
have a long answer to this well I have a
long answer but you know it's that I
followed my dream right here to this
building I wanted to work for my heroes
and so my gut told me run to Silicon
Valley and I begged to get into general
magic it was the persistence and the
experience that I had because i actually
had been doing things it was not about
your college degree it wasn't about
where you were from or your or it was
the passion you know people see it the
last kind of 15 years of my life has
lots of success but the first 15 years
of my life or 20 years a lot of life was
trying start up after startup and
failing and failing and so I would just
go off and do it because my gut told me
to there's no one path but you always
have to be doing is learning and trying
to adapt even under pressure when you
have failure what is the best piece of
advice of covee advice you've ever
received from a mentor in your life you
always have to continually learn so for
like nano degrees if you're in your well
employed you should be doing nano
degrees because you have to constantly
learn so that was the first thing my
mentor told me is because this means
this this this technology field moved so
rapidly the second thing is know when to
say no now that must be hard it's very
much how did you learn how to say no
well I learned it from Steve Jobs see
Steve said you know we you know people
to ask you know there's so many things
you could be doing and his job was to
say no to so many things and yes to only
those things that really mattered here's
a student named Bharat he asking you
what helps you Tony took on
invent well I think it's two things I
think it's a great question the first
one is about curiosity it's being
curious and the other one is being
frustrated when you're frustrated then
you're curious as to why am I frustrated
and you clue into those things so you
can figure out what's wrong and then fix
it ummet is asking a question after when
having the idea in my mind when he has
an idea what is the best practice to to
apply the idea and and implement it and
execute idea well like how do you go
about checking how valuable this do you
just not a company right away do you
know as your parent when we did well
don't ask your parents your parents are
always gonna validate you that's a great
idea do never ask your parents it's a
good or not I have great parents ask
your spouse I'm great parents but don't
ask him because they're always gonna say
that's wonderful honey it's great they
love you unconditionally whether it's a
good idea or a bad idea they're gonna
say it's great you're seeing as spouse
is the opposite spouse is the opposite
should be they should be truthful that's
what you want is a great partner so you
have to remember when you're disrupting
an industry and if you have something
dramatically different you have
disruptive technology then you can
change a stagnated market yes the way
that I've seen it is that you eat you
have to start with the idea what are you
changing and you have to take bold steps
in terms of making something and trying
it now you have to test lots of testing
so you would make something and then you
would go to of you know some of the
industry leaders or some of the people
you really trust who are knowledgeable
about a given area and you'd say what do
you think what do you think and then you
start to to set your risk level based on
how big the market is I think the way
the world changes is not by people being
safe but by challenging expectations
challenging the conventional wisdom and
if you want to change the world you need
to get out of the the the the area of
safeness Tony's been incredibly
privileged and wonderful learning
experience for me to have your nose very
very first inaugural Udacity talks but
thank you so much for coming it's been a
privilege Sebastian you're a good friend
and I
can't thank you enough for today I'm
learning as well so thank you thank you
