replace failed disks as soon as possible
we have the situation that both disks
are okay for this amount of time then a
disk fails and then we have only one
okay disk for the mean time to repair
for one disk so this is how long does it
take us to replace the disk after that
both disks are okay again and then we
again have this long until the next
failure so what's the mean time to data
loss for eight one with two disks the
question really is how many times can we
have this until we encounter the period
when a single disk has failed and during
the time it takes to replace it another
disk fails well it's equal to the length
of this interval this is how long we
survive with both disks working times
how many times can we get this until we
encounter a repair period where the
second disk failed during it so the
question is really what's the
probability of the second disk failing
during the time to repair one disk now
normally to calculate this probability
we would have to compute the
distribution for this function and then
see what's the probability for this
distribution being under entity r1 and
so on but when the time to repair is a
lot smaller than the time to failure of
a single disk then we can approximate
this probability of the second disk
failing during the MTTR for the first
disk simply as the MTTR divided by the
MTTF so for example if the MTTR
is let's say a single day and MTTF is a
hundred days then the probability of the
second failure during the repair period
is simply the length of the repair
period divided by the period that we
expected this to survive so for example
if the time to repair is for example one
day and the time to failure is let's say
a hundred days then we can expect that
there is a one in a hundred chance of a
disk failing during
the one day so now how many times can be
repaired this before we encounter one of
these well the number of times we can
try this B until we encounter a failure
is going to be one over this probability
so what we finally get is this the mean
time to data loss is MTTF of a
single-disc squared divided by two times
the mean time to repair for one disk how
long does it take us to replace the disk
and copy the data on it so that now we
have a fully functional raid 1 array and
as a reminder this is how long do we get
a working array with both disks
functional and this is how many times do
we do a repair until we can expect that
the second disk that is covering us
during the repair is going to fail on us
note that because the MTTF is much
larger than the MTTR
this is measured in years usually this
hopefully is hours or days it's just how
long does it take us to replace a disk
this factor here is very very large and
now we get many many times the MTTF of a
single disk over to this factor is way
larger than 2 which means that the time
to data loss with the raid 1 array with
only 2 disks is way higher than the time
to data loss for a single disk which
means the trade 1 is dramatically
improving reliability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
