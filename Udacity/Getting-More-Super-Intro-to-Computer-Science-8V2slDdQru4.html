programmer at least a more tasteful one
there's something about this two should
still really bother you in addition to
the fact that Dave is not getting eaten
any more we've got a big chunk of
duplicated code here well it's only one
line but it could be a lot more
depending on what you have to do to
actually eat someone if the victim is
not named Dave both the discerning bear
and the regular bear and the regular
grizzly bear do the same thing we had to
cut and paste that code to get that
behavior here what we'd like is a way to
be able to access the original eat
method of bear from inside the method
we're writing to override that method we
could change the name here but that
wouldn't solve our problem because then
inside chase which is defined inside
grizzly bear we would get the wrong
method so we can't change the name of
this method it still needs to be called
eat but we want a way of accessing the
eat method of bear to do this we need a
special operator which is the super
operator what super does is it takes a
class and an object and it returns a
special proxy this is sort of like an
object except it ignores the new
definitions provided by class what this
means is we can replace the code here
with a call to super passing and
discerning bear and self and that will
mean we're ignoring the overridden ye'd
method so now when we get the eat method
we're going to get the eat method from
the grizzly bear class which turns out
is the e method it inherited from the
barre class and the one requirement is
that the object that's passed in must be
an instance of the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
