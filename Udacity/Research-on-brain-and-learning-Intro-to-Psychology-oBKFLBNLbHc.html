just said about learning in the brain
the neuro scientist Eric Kandel
conducted groundbreaking research into
learning and neural growth and it led in
fact to a Nobel Prize one of Kendall's
big insights and studying learning and
the brain came from realizing it would
be best to study it in an animal with a
simple rather than complex nervous
system and one with really big neurons
once we can actually see with the naked
eye the perfect animal for this was the
sea snail he wanted to see what happened
at the neural level when these animals
learned in the short-term versus the
long-term so he administered a single
shock to activate the short-term
learning and saw that the snail learned
a defensive response that lasted for
about 10 minutes but if the shock was
administered four or five times the
animals learned defense was long-term
lasting days but here's the discovery
that led to the Nobel Prize Kendall was
the first neuroscientist to discover how
long-term learning happens at the neural
level he discovered there were new
proteins in the neurons for long-term
learning but not the short-term learning
and these new proteins led to new neural
structures and short to neural growth
upon further research Kendall and
covered how these proteins form that led
to new neural growth let's look at this
figure in this neuron we see a sensory
neuron connected to a motor neuron and
some activating neurotransmitter
glutamate being released this is the
baseline here in this figure we see what
happens in short-term learning and
memory when a mild stimulus is presented
more glutamate is released strengthening
the synaptic connection but note there's
no new neural structures that are
growing now in this image we see what
happens in long-term learning and memory
in response to a strong stimulus so many
stimuli are being presented a signal
then goes up the axon to the nucleus of
the cell turning on particular genes or
set of genes that then synthesize new
proteins to form these proteins then
create new neural structures down here
and even more glutamate is produced and
received by the motor neuron so these
new structures and strong synaptic
connections stay for days
days leading to long-term learning and
memory the moral of the story is that
long-term learning changes your brain in
a way that short-term learning and
memory do not finding worthy of a Nobel
Prize now go out and learn this material
and change your brain for good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
