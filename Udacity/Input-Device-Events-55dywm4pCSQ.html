devices then your primary input device
is a touchscreen that's always going to
be connected unless your device is
having a very bad day by contrast TV
remote controls and game controllers are
usually connected via bluetooth because
they're battery-powered controllers
often sleep to save power shutting down
the radios after a couple minutes of
unuse in this lesson we'll learn how to
handle connect and disconnect events
from input devices the input manager
fires events when devices are connected
or disconnected and it provides a method
for us to register an input device
listener which we can use to subscribe
to these events here they are you can
probably guess what two of these mean on
input device added and on input device
removed our triggered win devices are
connected or disconnected on input
device changed is a little bit different
typically input devices don't change but
they certainly can for example you can
imagine a game controller might have two
different modes a good strategy for
dealing with a change event is to simply
disconnect and then reconnect the device
let's see how our asteroids game handles
this and we'll start back in the game
view the first thing to notice is that
our view implements the input device
listener interface and we'll see what
this is defined in a sec once we've
implemented that interface all we need
to do is override those three methods we
discussed here's on input device added
what's cool here is that when a
controller is connected our game gets
the device ID and then creates a ship
for it we maintain a mapping from ship
to input device and in this way we can
support multiple players easily when a
controller is disconnected we simply
remove the ship corresponding to that
device ID pretty easy right here we are
in the constructor of our game view the
last step is to get a reference to the
input manager and then register our view
is listener for it rather than directly
accessing the system classes we use the
input manager compact provided by the
controller sample this is code that
you're free to reuse it abstracts away
differences in how input devices are
handled across different versions of
Android instead of designing your game
to work with an input manager from a
specific android version you can design
your game logic against input manager
compat this class contains a factory
method which behind the scenes will
instantiate an appropriate concrete
implementation depending on which
version of Android your game happens to
be running on and you can see that
factory method inside input manager
compat right down here at the bottom
and by the way the factory design
pattern is one of my favorites and I
highly recommend learning it if you
haven't seen it before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
