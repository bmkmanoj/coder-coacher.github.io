to discuss is the deployment diagram the
deployment diagram provides a static
deployment view of a system and unlike
previous diagram it is about the
physical allocation of components to
computational units thanks for example
of a client-server system in which I'll
have to define which components will go
on the server and which component will
go on the client for a deployment
diagram the nodes correspond the
computational unit for example a
specific device and the edges indicate
communication between these units also
in this case I'm going to illustrate
deployment diagrams using an example for
our course management system and also in
this case I'm going to use a slightly
more complex diagram than usual but I
don't want you to look at all the
individual details instead I would like
to focus on a few main aspects so if you
look at this diagram there are three
things that you should clearly see first
you should see how the system involves
four nodes a web server an application
server a DB server and a mainframe
second you should see which components
are deployed on which nodes for example
the student component is deployed on the
application server and finally you
should see how the nodes communicate
with one another for example you can see
the application server and the
university database communicated using a
JDBC protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
