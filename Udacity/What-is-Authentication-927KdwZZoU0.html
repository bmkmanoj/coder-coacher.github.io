authentication by going back to the
discussion we had about what the trusted
computing base does so we have resources
that need to be protected and we can do
that by having a trusted computing base
that is a reference monitor so every
request that comes for a resource has to
be monitored and when you monitor the
request the question you have is should
this request be able to access the
resource for which that is the target of
this request to answer that question we
really have to establish who is the
request coming from the source of the
request is we're going to be able to
identify that because we have
authentication in the system
so let's look look a little bit more
closely at what authentication really is
your authentication we said we have to
establish the source of request okay so
we have to sort of ask the question who
are you if you happen to be the source
and of course you can't just claim to be
anybody when you're going to claim that
you are Alice you have to provide some
evidence to us that is going to convince
us that you really are Alice
so authentication is knowing the
identity of the source and establishing
that it indeed is that person who's
making that claim about the identity so
once we establish the source of a
request convince ourselves that the user
is who he or she claims to be the next
part is authorization so in
authorization we're really establishing
whether the source of the request does
have the permissions necessary for the
resource that they want to access okay
so this permission check is the
authorization process and once
authentication and authorization is done
of course then we allow access to the
resource when permitted and the source
of the request is able to make use of
the resources so let's dig little deeper
into this question about what is
authentication okay we just discussed
that the operating system or the trusted
computing base or as
is that was more perhaps so the OS of
the trusted computing base needs to know
who is making a request for a resource
that is protected though access to that
resource has to be secured so we know
that in a computer system a request
actually comes from a process this
process may be running one of your
services your browser mail client
whatever it is so process is making the
request but we know that processes run
on behalf of users okay so a given
process that is making a request must be
running on behalf of a certain user we
call a user also a subject or a
principal these are the active entities
that actually make initiate requests or
cause actions okay so these terms are
used interchangeably but we'll stick
with the user
okay so process runs on behalf of a user
authentication which is our topic
essentially is going to help us answer
this question that we have is that if a
process is making a request to know on
you know who's making the request what
user is making the request we must
answer the question on whose behalf is
the process running so the requesting
process makes the request by making a
system call okay it comes to the
operating system but on whose behalf is
it making that call to establish the
user on whose behalf the process is
running of course we have to start with
authentication okay in the beginning
when a user comes to the system the user
is going to authenticate himself or
herself so that's how we for example
start a login session okay you log into
the system or start a session that's
going to launch you know one or more
processes that you need to run and then
in the end the session is going to be
over so when you start the login session
prior to launching the process that is
making the request of course you're
going to make a claim about your
identity you're going to tell the system
I am Alice and then the system is going
to ask you well give me some evidence so
I can believe that you
really our Ellis and when that evidence
is provided we need to verify ok the
verification actually tells us that the
user is actually who he or she claims to
be
and then that user launched an
application or start a process and that
process then is going to have sometimes
we say credentials of this user because
this user was authenticated in other
words those processes are going to run
on behalf of this user that just
authenticated and whatever resources
this user is able to access those
processes will be able to successfully
gain access to those resources
so really requests when we talk about do
come from processes but processes run on
behalf of users and we the system knows
what user a process is running on behalf
of because of authentication that comes
before the process gets launched and
makes the request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
