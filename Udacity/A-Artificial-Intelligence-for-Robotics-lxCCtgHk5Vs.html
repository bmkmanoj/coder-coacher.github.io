absolute meat of the of this class which
is called a star a star was invented by
Nils Nelson at Stanford many years ago
in his a variant of this search
algorithm that's more efficient than
expanding every note if you've gotten so
far you understand the mechanism for
searching by gradually expanding notes
in the open list a star is almost the
same thing but not quite to illustrate a
star I'm going to use the same word as
before but with a different obstacle
configuration this is one where a star
performs vide well obviously we are
forced to go down to here but then here
we have to still search for the optimum
path to the goal here is the same in
program code you can see all the ones
over here start sales over here Gold
sales over here if I run this code and
give you my expand list the ones you
program before you'll find that the
expansion goes down from here 0 2 1 2 3
4 5 but then it expands into the open
space 6 7 8 9 10 11 diagonally it
expands into the open space until it
finally hits the going-out 15 this took
16 expansions to get to this point let
me now switch on a star and run the code
again what we now find it only takes 10
expansions at this point from 0 to 9
over here so it expands down to 4 but
then it expands straight towards the
goal never touching this area over here
somehow magically knowing that up here
the path to the goal would be longer
than going straight now I didn't cheat I
didn't tell you there's a straight path
over here so let me put an obstacle
right here next to the goal and run a
star again but you find it does expand
up to 7 over here but then moves to the
second line over here expands up here
and then hits the goal again so it kind
of does the minimum amount of work
necessary to make maximum progress to
the goal that's a star and we now look
into a star in more detail a star uses a
so-called heuristic function which is a
function has to be set up if it's all 0
then a star resorts back to the search
algorithm you already implemented
if you call the heuristic function age
then for each cell results into a value
so let me give you some values here's
one it's number of step it takes to the
goal if there was no obstacle clearly
the numbers I'm putting in right now 1 2
3 4 5 and so on are not reflective of
the actual distance to the goal because
they don't consider the obstacles in a
world without obstacles the heuristic
function that I'm giving you would
actually measure the distance to the
goal
so the heuristic function has to be an
optimistic guess how far we are from the
goal so but differently for any cell X Y
the eristic function has to be an
optimistic guess which means the smaller
equal to the extra goal distance from
the quadrant X and y now that sounds a
little bit ad hoc but very often you can
give good heuristic functions really
easily like in this case over here if we
just know that the agent can move left
right up or down it's really easy to say
what is the number of steps that will
take the agent with no obstacles to get
to the goal location and this is table
over here that is easily generated
automatically now in reality this is an
underestimate if obstacles for example
look like this then from here takes you
more than 9 steps to get to the goal it
takes you 13 steps to get over the hump
over here but therein lies the beauty of
the heuristic function it doesn't have
to be accurate if it was accurate you
probably already solved the planning
problem this would be a function that
helps you understand where to search
next in the case of tides and it has to
be just so that it underestimates or at
best equals the true distance from the
goal many many problems have functions
like these in our self-driving car we
use a function just like this in fact
the function is just showing you we are
using in our software for freeform
navigation and it boils down not to the
number of grid cell steps but to the
Euclidean distance to a target location
but I hope you understand how you ristic
function might look like there's many
many valid views the function including
setting everything to zero which would
not really help me so let's work with
this Vanier istic function here's your
vista code you can see the same your
stick function the key modification out
for our search algorithm is really
really simple we again have an open list
and the arrow state rewrite on the G
value but we also write down the G value
plus the heuristic value G value here is
zero the risk value is nine so the sum
of the two is nine I call this the F
value this is the cumulative jeeva you
plus the heuristic value as looked up in
the table over here if I now expand I
remove the element with the lowest F
value and not the lowest G value and
that's all that is to a star let me give
you an example say we went to the open
list all the way down here that is we
expanded all these states over here and
this is the one presently on the open
list our G value will be five our u
ristic before and the sum is nine as
before let's now expand this note we get
to this one over here the G value
increases to six G Plus heuristic is
still 9 6 plus 3 is 9 and now let's
expand it more and there's now two
options finally this state over here in
this state over here the one up here is
called three to the one on the right is
called 4 3 the G value over here in both
cases is seven but when we add the H
value you get a difference up here we
find the H value before we kind of move
it a little bit away from the goal
according to the heuristic that gives us
a total of 11 whereas for the feet over
here we find the a try to be two seven
plus two equals nine and here is the
first time that a star makes an actual
difference it has a preference to expand
this node over here over the node over
here to see why the F value the sum of G
and H over here is nine but over here
it's 11
what this reflects is that according to
the heuristic this guy is actually two
steps closer to the goal in this guy
over here this guy according to the
eristic maybe two steps away from the
goal the guy over here is at least four
steps away a star now we'll expand this
node over here because it's F value is
nine versus 11 so let's do this in
expanding this node we find there's two
valid neighbors the guy up here the guy
on the right first guy's coordinate are
three three second guy is four four and
as before we increment the G value by
one gives us eight in both cases and now
we add the heuristic to the G value
which for the first one over here is 3 3
plus 8 is 11 but it's the one on the
right we get one is a heuristic 1 plus 8
is 9 that's the result of expanding the
node over here and here's our new open
list and again we have a preference on
the open list are these three states but
we prefer the one on the right because
this F value is smaller than the other
two F values the one over here is 9
the ones over here has an F value of 11
so once again we expand and in the
expansion will be the gold state and
then we find the gold set and we're done
without ever expanding anything in the
maze up here that feels like magic but
the key thing here is by providing
additional information the so-called
aristocrats you can pick a node that
looks closer to the goal state and as a
result we will likely make more progress
towards sigil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
