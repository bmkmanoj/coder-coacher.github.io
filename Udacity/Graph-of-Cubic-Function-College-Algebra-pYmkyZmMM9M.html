for cubic functions f of X equals x
cubed so I thought I should show you the
graph of this function here it is this
blue pretty curve we can see that this
has the same overall behavior as the
other cubic function that we saw in the
last example that one looked a little
more like this
but you can see that the overall
behavior is the same one end of the
graph is going down to negative infinity
and the other end of the graph is going
up to positive infinity in the middle of
there's sort of a gray area of in this
case going down and then going up again
and in this case sort of leveling out
for a bit now as I said the last quiz
this parent function looks really
different than the parent function for
quadratic functions let's just add that
onto our graph so we can compare them
more easily so here once again is the
parent function for a quadratic function
f of X equals x squared let's examine
the overall behavior of this graph as
well we know that the general shape of a
parabola is kind of like a u or if it's
upside down like an N whether it's
opening upward or opening downward a
parabola has a vertex which is that
there it's minimum or it's maximum and
then both of its ends point in the same
direction and then as X gets further
away in either the negative direction or
the positive direction the graph points
the same way either both ends of it go
to positive infinity or both ends go to
negative infinity we also talked earlier
about how a parabola has an axis of
symmetry running down the middle of it
said if you fold the graph in half along
that line it will exactly map to the
other side of itself that's not the case
over here with X cubed if we simply fold
this graph in half down the y axis this
right side is not going to end up
looking just like the left side it'll
look more like this not the same this is
all really interesting stuff now since
we're increasing powers why don't we
just do that one more time so now I've
put both y equals x squared and y equals
x cubed on the same coordinate plane but
I draw another graph over here for you
my question for you now is what function
does this graph represent
now think about what this graph does on
either side of the y-axis and also think
about what points you would expect each
of these functions to go through your
choices are at y equals x y equals x
squared y equals x cubed y equals x to
the fourth and y equals x to the fifth
so you can always make a t-chart
and plug in some points and see which of
those t-shirts best matches this graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
