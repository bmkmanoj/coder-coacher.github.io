you again of Bayes rule we looked at
this last time the straight Bayes rule
is that we can say that p of x given Z
the p of the state given the measurement
can be written this way this is the
likelihood all right this is the total
probability of Z this that's our prior
before the measurement that's our belief
if you will of what the value was okay
so what's important here to realize is
once i get the measurement somebody
gives you the measurement you drove two
to two measurements r us and you picked
up your measurement you need to know
which measurement they were going to
give you and there's a probability that
they'll give you all these different met
once they give you a measurement the
probability of having gotten that
measurement is done it is whatever it
was it's not going to change so what
that allows us to do is to sort of
replace that by this normalization
factor right it's some value or another
way of saying this is that p of x given
Z is proportional to P of Z given X all
right times the prior so if I had a
whole bunch of different possible X's
and I only had this value okay for p of
x given Z they have to sum to 1 so what
I could do is I could just take the sum
of all of those whatever they were and
then divide this value by that / that
some and I would be back to a real
renormalized probability density all
right that's why we write it as this ada
we talk about this proportion and in
fact next time when we do particle
filtering you'll see that what we do is
we we sample all these X's we multiply
them by their likelihoods and we get all
these values but they don't sum to 1 so
what we have to do is take this take all
the sum sum them up then divide each of
those by that some and they'll sum up to
1 again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
