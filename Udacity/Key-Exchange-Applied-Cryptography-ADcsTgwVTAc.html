they agree on two shared values the
first is Q some large prime number and
the second is G and G is a primitive
root of Q what it means to be a
primitive root is that for all numbers
in the group Z q that is the numbers 1 2
through Q minus 1 we can generate all
those numbers by raising G to some
integer power if Q is prime it must have
a primitive root and there are ways to
find these primitive roots we could
think of a brute force way of trying
numbers until we find one that would be
very expensive for a large prime number
but they're more efficient ways to find
them which we won't talk about so that's
why they start with those two things and
then here's how the protocol works Alice
will select large random number and Bob
will also select his own large random
number this is like selecting the secret
paint colors then Alice will compute the
value we'll call Y a and she'll compute
that by raising G to the X a power and
doing this modulo Q Bob will do the same
thing but with his secret power xB so
he'll raise G to the X B power modulo Q
they'll exchange these values so Alice
sends Y a to Bob Bob sends Y B to Ellis
and then Alice will compute a key that
will be shared between Alice and Bob and
she'll compute that by raising the YB
value that she received from Bob to the
XA power and do that all modulo Q if
this is a good key distribution protocol
well then there should be a way for Bob
to compute the same key I'll see if you
can figure that out yourself
by making that a quiz so these are the
possible choices which one of these
should Bob compute to obtain the same
key as Alice did here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
