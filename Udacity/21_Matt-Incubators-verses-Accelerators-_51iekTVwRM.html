are a lot of accelerators there's
accelerators that universities are put
together the private corporations and
put together and then there's the sort
of private investment vehicle
accelerators like Y Combinator and
there's a lot of them the interesting
thing about accelerators is the jury's
still out on the efficacy of
accelerators there's a huge question out
there of if a company goes to an
accelerator program or doesn't go to an
accelerator program what are the odds of
success does an accelerator increase the
likelihood of success and there's a lot
of research going on in that yeah Yael
Hochberg at MIT and Susan Cohen at the
University of Richmond or publishing all
kinds of papers based on this i'm using
crunchbase data and we saw a recent
study from UC Berkeley which showed that
well it's still difficult to tell
whether accelerators increase the odds
of success one thing that accelerators
are doing is they're making companies
fail faster because the mentors and the
feedback that the entrepreneurs are
getting help everybody understand is
this a problem that's worth solving is
as a business that's going to make it or
not and it's moving much faster within
the environment of an accelerator versus
outside of an accelerator so that is
something that definitely has been
proven thus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
