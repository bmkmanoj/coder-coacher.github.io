advanced operating systems course
recall that the Cornell experiment that
we saw as the last piece of the previous
module argues for a component based
design to reduce the pain points in the
development of complex software systems
in industries that are designing and
commercializing production operating
systems and distributed services through
the client-server paradigm there's an
other important pain point and that is
how to design for the continuous and
incremental evolution of complex
distributed software systems both in
terms of functionality and performance
the short answer to the puzzle is
distributed object technology we saw how
object technology is employed in the
tornado parallel operating system as a
structuring tool to allow the
scalability of operating system services
in a parallel system in this module of
the advanced operating systems course we
are going to see examples of how
distributed object technology is
influencing commercial offerings in the
computer industry we'll start this
lesson module with the discussion of the
spring system which was designed and
implemented in Sun Microsystems as a
network operating system for use in a
local area network later on spring was
marketed as a Suns Solaris operating
system before we discuss the spring
system a little bit of history and some
personal connection use of khalili one
of the chief architects of the spring
system God is PhD from Georgia Tech in
1989 developing the clouds distributed
operating system which is an object
based operating system and he was my
numero uno PhD student incidentally not
surprisingly the spring system was
heavily influenced by Yusuf's work with
clouds
and spring came out commercially a Suns
Solaris NC product and for the trivia
buffs out there Yousef is now heading
Microsoft's Azure cloud computing
product by the way Azure has nothing to
do with the cloud system that you have
developed as a grad student at Georgia
Tech later on when we discuss giant
scale services and cloud computing we
will feature an interview with Yousef
wherein he shares his thoughts on future
evolution of distributed system services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
