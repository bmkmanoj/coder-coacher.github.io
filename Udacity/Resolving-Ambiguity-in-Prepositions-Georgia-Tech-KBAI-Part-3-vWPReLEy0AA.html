the three kinds of semantic categories
that by my point to so here is a
sentence in which by points to an agent
that was written by a shook actually
this particular sentence was written by
David the second sentence David went to
New York by train here by is pointing to
a conveyance David stood by the statue
here by is pointing to a location by
this statue so while use of the word by
helped us in that it constrained the
interpretation of Ashok to either a
agent conveyance or location it by
itself doesn't tell us whether a
showcase a agent or conveyance or
location we need some additional
knowledge let us suppose that the agent
has a ontology of the world the term
ontology initially comes from philosophy
where it means the nature of reality in
artificial intelligence the term
ontology often refers to the
conceptualization of the world the
categories in terms of which I specify
the world these categories and become
the vocabulary of the knowledge
representation so let us suppose the
agent has this ontology of the world the
world is composed of things and things
can be agents or objects or locations
agents are people and Ashok and debated
examples of agents objects can be
conveyancers and trains and cars are
examples of conveyances obviously this
is a very small part of someone's
ontology about the world now this
ontology helps us decide that Ashok in
the first sentence is an agent let's see
how here we have by Ashok and we know
from the propositional constraints that
by can refer to an agent conveyance or
location so the question now becomes
Ashok an agent Ashoka conveyance or a
shocker location we can look into this
ontology Ashok is people which is an
agent so now we know that a shock must
be an agent similarly the second
sentence train can be an agent
conveyance a location let's look at a
warrant ology but train is a conveyance
so now we know the crane is a conveyance
similarly for statue statue in this case
specifies a location now that this
analysis applies to different
propositions not just to by supposing
this first sentence was that was written
with a joke and we
casus proposition width will point to a
shock either being a co agent or being
an instrument so again we now know that
Ashoka the co agent in the sentence
which contained the proposition with
there is another important thing to note
here initially when we were given
descendants David went to New York by
train we started doing bottom-up
processing David was a noun went was a
verb but pretty soon be shifted to
top-down processing as an example we
already have this background knowledge
and his background knowledge tells us in
a top-down manner that by here can refer
to an agent conveyance or a location we
also have this additional background
knowledge and this background knowledge
tells us then in this particular
sentence the train is referring to a
conveyance because train is a conveyance
in this ontology so low level bottom of
processing generates queues which access
probes into memory memory then returns
knowledge like this and the processing
becomes top down the top-down processing
tells us how to interpret the various
words in the sentence how to make sense
