solve this problem and that's true for
all programming problems one of the
things i hope you'll learn from this
class is that you can do experiments you
can try lots of different things see
what works and they're often some
solutions that will be better than
others but you should always feel free
to try running code in an interpreter to
see what happens here's one way to solve
this we're going to use print and we
need an expression that computes the
number of minutes in seven weeks so
we'll multiply 7 which is the number of
weeks times seven days in a week x 24
hours in a day x 60 minutes in an hour
and that will output the number of
minutes in seven weeks let's try that in
the Python interpreter when we run and
we get seventy thousand five hundred
sixty minutes as our answer that seems
like a long time you can do this course
at any pace you want but it's designed
to take most people about seven weeks to
complete some will go faster some will
go slower and that's fine what I hope is
that by the end of the course you feel
like you can really write programs to do
interesting things and that you've got a
great understanding of computer science
of course we don't expect you to spend
all 70,000 minutes during those seven
weeks just working on this course you
may need to eat sleep work a job go to
school do some other things but I hope
you'll really enjoy the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
