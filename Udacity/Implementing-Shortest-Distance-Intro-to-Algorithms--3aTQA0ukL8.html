implement the shortest distance oh we
give it all the distances we've
calculated so far for all the nodes that
we could do that for and so that's just
a big pile here there's there's a bunch
of nodes and for each node we have some
value and a lot of these values are
temporarily assigned they may actually
change later but what we want to know is
which of these would like to pull out
the smallest value and then we'd
actually like to delete it from this
this set so we don't have to worry about
getting the same value over and over and
over again when I next time we want to
go in here we want to get the next
smallest
so how many different values might be in
this blob well there can be at most one
for each node there probably less was
probably lots of nodes that haven't been
added in yet but at worst it's going to
be big theta of n the nodes that are in
the graph may have distances associated
with them so to get the smallest
distance in here a natural thing to do
is to loop through the list so take all
the distances that we actually have at
the moment just loop through them and
pull out the minimum easy big data event
and in fact that's what I implemented
here so shortest distances and it starts
off with the best node undefined and and
best value something big from probably
really want something bigger than this
and for all the nodes that we have
distances for if the distance for that
node is better than the best we've seen
so far reassign and when you're done
just return the best node so this is
really quite straightforward and what is
the running time that this leads to all
right so these are some trickier run
times than the ones I've suggested in
the past but we've got n nodes and M
edges and we want to know if we
implement the Dijkstra algorithm with
looping through the list to find the
smallest value what is the running time
that we get so just make your selection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
