been doing just fine how have you been
good it's been a while I understand you
went to Africa I went to Africa the
entire continent or at least parts of it
how is Africa it's fine it's a warm the
entire continent the entire continent or
at least Kenya and Nigeria okay
particularly Nigeria which was 80
something degrees in 4000 percent
humidity so do you want to do a shout
out to any and either your friends from
there yeah I'd like to say hi to
chairman I like to say hi to prof. oh
and good times I'd like to say had a
good time he was awesome okay so Michael
I am back now so that we can talk about
the last little section that we're gonna
do in this class and it's game theory
that sounds cool what does that have to
do with machine learning so that's an
interesting question because in fact
game theory comes from a tradition way
outside of machine learning in AI but
you'll see in a moment why it as I care
about game theory and really this is a
very natural extension to all the stuff
we've been talking about with
reinforcement learning interesting and
we're talking about games like monopoly
in some sense we are because all of life
is like monopoly so in fact what is game
theory maybe that's what we can do we
could just try to find game theory and
maybe it'll be clear why it is we're
worried about this at all seem fair yeah
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
