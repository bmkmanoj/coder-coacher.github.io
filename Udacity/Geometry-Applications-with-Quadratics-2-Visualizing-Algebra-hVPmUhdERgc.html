width should be 8 feet nice problem
solving for getting that one correct to
start solving I would draw a rectangle
will have a width here and a length here
a dog run is just an enclosed
rectangular area where a dog can play
this would be a bird's eye view or
looking down from up top into a dog run
we want to start by working with an
equation for the perimeter and the area
since we enclose the dog run using 46
feet of fencing we know that all of this
are these sides added together would be
the perimeter or 46 feet we have enough
concrete to cover 120 square feet so the
area of this rectangle and the gray is
120 feet squared that's what we can use
for a now that we have these two
equations we can start to solve our
system of equations we want to solve
this equation for the length and then
substitute that expression in here I've
taken this equation and rewritten it
here well divide each of the terms by 2
and then we'll subtract w from both
sides to get 23 minus W equals L we
don't change the equation involving the
area and now ready substitute the value
of L here for 23 minus W so after we
substitute will have the equation 120
equals the quantity 23 minus W times W
we distribute the W to each of the terms
to get this new equation and now we want
to solve this quadratic we add W squared
to both sides and subtract 23w from both
sides to get our new equation we factor
this quadratic by finding factors of 120
that sum to negative 23 those factors
are negative 15 and negative 8 this
means we set each factor equal to 0 so W
can equal positive 15 or W can equal
positive 8 we usually consider the width
to be the shorter side so the width will
be 8 feet and the length will be 15 feet
and as a quick check if we add up all
the sides around the rectangle will get
46 feet which was our original perimeter
and for the area if we multiply the
length times the width will have
times 8 which equals 120 feet squared
this also checks this means the
dimensions are 15 feet by 8 feet the
length by the width</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
