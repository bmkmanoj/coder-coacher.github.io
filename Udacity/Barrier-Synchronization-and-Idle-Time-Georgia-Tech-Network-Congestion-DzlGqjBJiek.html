today is something called barrier
synchronization whereby a client or an
application might have many parallel
threads and no forward progress can be
made until all the responses for those
threads are satisfied for example a
client might send a synchronized read
with four parallel requests but suppose
that the fourth is dropped at this point
we have a request sent at time zero then
we see a response less than a
millisecond later and at this point
threads one two three complete but TCP
may timeout on the fourth in this case
the link is idle for a very long time
while that fourth connection is timed
out the addition of more servers in the
network induces an overflow of the
switch buffer causing severe packet loss
and inducing throughput collapse one
solution to this problem is to use
fine-grained TCP retransmission timers
on the order of microseconds rather than
on the order of milliseconds reducing
the retransmission timeout for TCP thus
improved system throughput another way
to reduce the network load is to have
the client acknowledge every other
packet rather than every packet thus
reducing the overall network load the
basic idea here and the premise is that
the timer's need to operate on a
granularity that's close to the
round-trip time of the network in the
case of a data center that's hundreds of
microseconds or less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
