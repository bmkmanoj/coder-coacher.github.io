things accessible to anyone who can't
use a mouse or pointing device whether
that's because there's any type of
physical impairment or a technology
issue or simply personal preference you
would have seen that while it definitely
requires some care and thought it's not
a huge amount more work if you plan it
from the beginning and once that work is
done you're already a long way down the
path to a fully accessible site already
you've made your site usable by more
people than if you hadn't addressed
keyboard usability and given your site a
more polished completed feel in this
lesson we're gonna build on that work
and get you thinking about other
accessibility factors like how do we
build our websites to support users like
Victor who can't see the screen at all
we'll start with some background on
assistive technology the general term
for things like screen readers these are
tools that are designed to help users
whose impairments can prevent them from
accessing information technology at all
next up we'll take a look at some
general user experience concepts we'll
build on those to take a deeper dive
into the experience of users of
assistive technology then finally when
we've into how we can use HTML
effectively to create a good experience
for these users and we'll see that
actually does overlap quite a lot with
the way we address focus first let's
talk a bit about assistive technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
