computability by taking you back to
early high school or late middle school
when you first learned about the notion
of a function here we have the teacher
and here are some very earnest students
sitting in the front row the teacher
begins by defining the notion of a
relation saying that it is a set of
ordered pairs where the first element
comes from a set called the domain and
the second comes from a set called the
range and a function then is a special
kind of relation where each element of
the domain is paired with exactly one
element of the range and of course this
rather abstract definition is well
beyond the maturity of everyone in the
class then the teacher writes some
examples of functions on the board like
f of X is equal to 3x plus 2 or G of X
is equal to negative x squared plus 1
and then the students get a flash of
insight and say to themselves oh I get
it a function is what you do to X in
order to get Y I mean f of X in fact the
student understands the function as an
algorithm a finite number of steps to
follow that lets you find the output
given an input notice however that the
teachers definition was very different
being given in terms of the rather
abstract notion of sets now for the rest
of this algebra class and maybe for as
much math as the student studies the
difference between the students
computational understanding and the
teachers definition won't be important
the student will know how to solve all
the problems and probably won't give the
teachers definition much more thought in
reality however there's a profound
difference between these two notions and
indeed this difference between
computation on the one hand and
functions on the other will be the
subject of the first part of this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
