writing media playback applications
based on media session media controller
and Media Browser service classes one of
the nice features of this API is that
apps can be abstracted into two
components one part stores and plays
back the media and the other part
provides a user interface to allow the
user to select the item to play and a
pause next track etc an interesting side
effect of this design is that your app
can export the media to other apps
running on the device so the Android
auto app can query the available music
from your app and show it using a user
interface appropriate for the car
Android wear is also able to do the same
and show a user interface appropriate
for the wearable device this all works
without you having to write user
interfaces for these other platforms if
you implement the API correctly it all
comes for free as a final bonus Android
wear also includes media browser support
if you allow Android wear to call your
own get root method it will allow you to
browse and playback music from a
wearable device you don't need to write
any code for Android wear it just works
for free you can try the um some play it
yourself to see this in action so let's
talk about how we implement a media
playback app for Android auto this
diagram shows three components your app
on the right which is all in an apk file
the Android auto companion app this app
is responsible for drawing the user
interface and seeing the pixels to the
vehicle display and this here is the
vehicle display itself it doesn't do
much except draw the pixels from the
Android auto companion playsound and
captures voice input inside your app you
implement a Media Browser service this
service maintains a tree structure of
all of your media such as a collection
of music this could be either streamed
or stored locally your app also
implements a media session which tracks
the current state of what your app is
playing you implement a media session
call back to get notified of when the
user selects a new song or when the
playback controls are pressed the
Android auto app connects to your Media
Browser service and queries it to get
the tree structure of your apps music
library the driver of the car then gets
to select a song using either the
touchscreen like this or using voice
search in the car and then Android auto
we use the media session to run your
callbacks
you never have to worry about all the
details of making a user interface that
is safe for driving because Android auto
takes care of all of that for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
