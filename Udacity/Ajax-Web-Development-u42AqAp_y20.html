what exactly is it and how important is
it to know Ajax and use Ajax
okay sure so what Ajax is it's basically
a request you make from the browser
using javascript
it's an HTTP request but basically it
happens within the page so you can use
this for loading just part of a page
without reloading with basic without
change in the URL so you can have extra
little snippets for example the voting
on reddit when you click one of those up
arrows and the color just changes we
make an AJAX request to the server that
says such-and-such just voted on this
link and then we just update it in the
client using javascript it is really
handy it's really common across just
about all websites these days but it's
not required and actually I found that
once you start thinking in Ajax it's
really hard to design things kind of
properly it's hard to decide when should
I actually have a new page and when
shouldn't I so I hope I did you a favor
and and in terms of like form validation
and that sort of thing so you can see
how you do it kind of you know the old
fashioned way before you reach the Ajax
because Ajax isn't always the the right
tool but you know I just kind of loot it
to form validation you know when you
type in all those things just hitting
submit and then getting your errors
without reloading the whole page is a
really common use of Ajax but you still
need to validate things when you submit
the form for real so you're gonna have
to do everything I just showed you
anyway um as for how to learn that just
just go before it it's it's built in you
know it's it's on every website it's
extremely popular knowing what you know
now in terms of requests and get and
posts and HTTP and all of that it should
be pretty easy concept for you to digest
okay there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
