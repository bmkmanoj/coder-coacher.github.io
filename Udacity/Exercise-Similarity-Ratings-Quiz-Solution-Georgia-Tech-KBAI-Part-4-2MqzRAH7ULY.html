the two most similar were the woman
climbing up a stepladder and the woman
climbing a set of stairs I said the
woman climbing stepladder is a little
bit more similar because a stepladder is
more similar to a ladder than a set of
stairs but in both these situations we
still have a woman and she's still going
up some kind of physical artifact for
third I put an ant walking up a wall I
ranked that as a little bit more similar
than a woman climbing the corporate
ladder because here there's the same
kind of physical motion up something
here the motion is more metaphorical but
there's also similarity between the real
ladder and the corporate ladder so this
could have been ranked higher as well
for the fifth one I chose the plane
taking off into the sky while it's
physically similar to an end climbing up
a wall and that they're both rising here
the degree to which it's rising is much
more significant and the mechanism by
which it's rising is different as well
and the woman painting the ladder is
only similar in that there also is a
woman and they're also as a ladder so I
didn't think that was very similar and
in the water bottle setting I desk is
not similar at all interesting answer
David note that there are several
factors in David's answers the two
situations that he thought were most
similar to woman climbing up a ladder it
is similarity in the relationship
climbing up as well as similarity
between objects woman and ladder in
contrast one that he did not think was
very similar to woman climbing up a
ladder woman painting the ladder
although there is some similarity
between the objects woman and ladder the
relationship is very different here it
is climbing up a ladder here it is
painting a ladder which are two very
different activities between one and two
we notice that both of them have the
same relationship climbing up but the
object is different in one case it is
the stepladder in another case it is a
set of stairs so one can have
similarities and relationships one can
have similarities and objects of course
some of you may have different rankings
for the similarity than the one David
gave because your background knowledge
might be different or your priorities
might be different but the point here is
the similarity can be measured along
several dimensions around the dimension
of relationships around the dimension of
objects around the dimensions of
features of objects and among the
dimensions of values of features of
objects that are participating in
relationships we'll talk more about this
