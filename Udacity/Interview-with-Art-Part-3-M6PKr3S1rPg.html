you know if somebody is a good
collaborator right because these
candidates when they get their job and
they're they have to work with other
people on you know shared code bases so
how do you know from a github profile if
somebody is going to be a good
collaborator so one thing I do to screen
people for like how they'll work well on
a team or how well their work on our
team is to sort of branch out from the
github profile and you know maybe start
with the issues on a repo that they
participated in and see how they you
know participate in those threads and if
they've commented on pull requests and
whatnot and just get a sense for how
they interact with other engineers in
the repo particularly one thing that I
think is really interesting is how you
know whether they're patient with kind
of people that may be newer to the
community and then from there like so
you branch out and maybe find if there's
an Internet Relay Chat channel that they
may have been in related to a repo and
and look at the logs and just see how
they are they helpful are they you know
are they kind are they patient and you
know it's such an important signal
because at the end of the day you really
want to hire people that are going to
work well in a team be a good fit for
your team and so yeah spent a lot of
time doing that just kind of digging in
and seeing how they interact with other
engineers publicly yeah so when you're
talking about interacting with that
other engineers publicly you mean on
like open source projects right I know
you know personally it's very daunting
to start working on this big library and
all these other you know really
intelligent people are working on so how
would you start or like what's your
advice for you know beginner a new
programmer to actually start
contributing to these open source
projects yeah it's a great point Matt I
mean it's really daunting and I mean
even for me and I know one thing that I
do and then i recommend people do to
just sort of i don't break the ice with
a new project is is like find some
documentation even the readme one thing
I love to do is actually go through the
readme you know clone the project try to
build it try to get it running you know
following the steps in the readme and
then like try to clarify it based on the
sort of problems that I had maybe it
just needs to be updated a little bit
submit a pull request with a few changes
to the readme
almost always get accepted and it's just
a great way to break the ice I mean
you're gonna move on actually like
fixing bugs and then maybe actually
contributing features but just to sort
of get into that community and get over
that initial help of feeling intimidated
and there's just so much code and not
knowing where to start um I find just
contributing some documentation that's a
great way to start cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
