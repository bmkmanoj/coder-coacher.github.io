widget is just isn't enough room to show
everything you might want the ability to
resize widgets gives you the flexibility
to share almost all of your code yet
give users the flexibility to choose how
much space they want your widget to take
up remember our design in the beginning
to buy one widget will give our icon the
full height and we'll use the same
styling as list items within sunshine
for the high and low temperature for
wider widgets will show the description
of the weather as well since we'll be
sharing as much code as we can make sure
common elements like the image and
high-temperature text use the same IDs
across all three layouts so how do we
know what layout to use on Android
foreign lower devices we know the size
will always be our default size how long
android 4.1 and higher devices will take
advantage of a new method added to app
widget manager get app widget options
this takes a widget ID and returns a
bundle which contains information such
as the current size of that widget in DP
with that information we can easily
switch between layouts by comparing the
widgets width to specific values
denoting the breakpoints between our
layouts in fact we can use two new
attributes added to app widget provider
info min resize height and min resize
width these let you set a minimum size
that's smaller than the default size
with this we can make our default the to
buy one widget and allow users to resize
down to a one by one if they're crunch
for space this is great for ensuring
that you put the best experience forward
while maintaining flexibility we'll also
add one more method to our app with your
provider on app widget options changed
this is called whatever the size of the
widget is changed in our case similar to
our own receive and on update method
will start the intensivist to refresh
our widget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
