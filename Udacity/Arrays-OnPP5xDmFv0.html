implementations of lists in many
programming languages the ability to
create an array is built-in as a core
feature you may have seen or heard of
them before but it's important to have a
more formal definition of what an array
is so we can compare them to other data
structures a bit later as I mentioned
before an array is a list with a few
added rules so we already know that it
has some things in some order in some
languages you can only have objects with
the same types in the same array and in
some languages your array can contain
different types so we can't use that as
a rule to define arrays
it would also be nice to say that arrays
have a set size that you determine right
when you create them again this is only
true in some programming languages so we
need to avoid adding that to our
definition defining the thing that
different languages call arrays is
actually pretty hard there is one big
feature that differentiates arrays from
lists each array has a location called
an index an index is just the number
associated with that place in the array
it would make sense to number these
boxes from 1 to 5 but of course it can't
be that simple
normally an index starts at 0 so instead
of referring to these boxes as 1 to 5 we
usually say it's 0 to 4 having indices
can make using arrays a great or
sometimes terrible choice for the code
you're working on if you need to access
a certain location in the middle
frequently using an array can be a great
choice you just need to keep track of
how long the array is calculate the
middle element and check the object in
the box with that index insertion and
deletion can be really messy with arrays
though inserting in the end is often
easy but it can be hard if the array has
a set size and you've already filled it
up insertion is difficult if you want to
put an element in the middle of the
array if you want to do a normal insert
you'll need to move everything after the
inserted element back into different
boxes with a different index the
operation as a whole is pretty
inefficient since you need to move every
element behind the one you're inserting
back in the
ray in the worst case this operation
takes linear time or a Big O of n
deletion causes a similar problem if you
delete an element you have an empty box
you can't just look at the index and say
that this is the fourth element anymore
since there's an empty box before it
again all of this can change based on
the way a particular language implements
an array but it's important to consider
when talking about arrays abstractly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
