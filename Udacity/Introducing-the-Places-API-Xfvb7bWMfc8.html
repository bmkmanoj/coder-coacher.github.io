some things that your user won't have to
like figuring out their location for
them so they don't have to type on that
tiny little keyboard in sunshine we ask
the user for their location but the
Google Maps platform provides location
services that could allow us to get a
location automatically the places API
was released earlier this year and
includes a variety of helpful location
services for example the autocomplete
API offers your users the power of
predictive autocomplete for places with
a user experience similar to the Google
search box you can also get the users
current location get a place by ID and
even add a place to the Google Places
database but for sunshine we're going to
use the place picker because it provides
a UI dialog that displays an interactive
map and a list of nearby places from
geographical addresses to local
businesses users can then choose a place
that is passed back to your app you
could always develop your own location
widget but there are several advantages
to using the place picker first and
foremost the user experience will be
consistent with other apps using the
place picker including both google apps
and third party ones this means your
users will likely already know how to
interact with this widget second
accessibility is built in and you should
already know how important that is but
finally it saves you development time so
that you can focus your efforts on the
features you care the most about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
