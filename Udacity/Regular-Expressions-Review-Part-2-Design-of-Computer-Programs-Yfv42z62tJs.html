well we saw one example where the star
was a special character and where for
example a star represents a a a a and so
on as well as the empty string because
it could be zero occurrences of a so
let's make a list of the special
characters examples of their use and
what they match so we've seen the
asterisk another special character is
the question mark so a question mark
matches either the empty string or the
single string a and nothing else so it
means an optional occurrence of whatever
comes before in this case na could be a
b c whatever
another special character is the dot or
period and that stands by itself it
doesn't have a two character sequence
and so for example a dot can match the
character a or the character B or C or
seven or exclamation point or any other
single character but it doesn't match
the empty string and it doesn't match
multiple character string we're almost
done
there's only two more special characters
in this subset of regular expressions
that I want to talk about languages like
Python have very complicated patterns
that they can match against for regular
expressions some of them go beyond
regular to irregular expressions but
we're gonna talk about a specific subset
that we can write a program for to do
regular expression matching and it's
only gonna have five special characters
so these three then the up arrow again
is a character that's by itself not a
two character sequence so the up arrow
by itself matches only right at the
beginning of the line or that is at the
beginning of the text that we're
matching against and so it's not much
used by itself but in conjunction with
another character it can limit the match
to the beginning so for example up arrow
B matches against any string that starts
with a B
like B a or BB or anything else where B
is the first character but it doesn't
match something where the B is in the
middle like a B C whereas B by itself
would match against ABC in the middle
and finally dollar sign is the
convention for matching at the end so a
dollar sign
matches ba but doesn't match say a B or
anything else where the a isn't at the
end so let's correctly strike these out
to say that these are not matches for
these two batters okay so that's it
these are the five special characters
what else goes into a regular expression
well the empty string and the only
example of the empty string is the empty
string and what does that match only the
empty string then any character that's
not one of these five like an A that
matches exactly the character itself a
match is a B matches B and so on and
finally any concatenation of two regular
expressions matches those two one
followed by another so BA that matches
ba that doesn't match other sequences
like a a for BB okay so that's my
language for regular expressions five
special characters empty character one
character or two regular expressions
concatenated to each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
