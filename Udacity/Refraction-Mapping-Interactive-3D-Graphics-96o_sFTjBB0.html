vector to perform reflection mapping you
can also create a refraction vector and
use that instead to access the
environment map this can be combined
with the color of the object to get
different variations of a material that
looks a fair bit like glass Snell's law
is what's normally used for computing
the refraction direction it's named
after will abroad snowiest a Dutch
astronomer and mathematician from the
17th century however it turns out that
even saw a Persian mathematician
discovered this back in 984 ad this is
an old formula and is as follows in this
diagram we have a ray of light traveling
through say the air and hitting a
transparent object say made of glass in
this equation n1 and n2 are the index
refraction of the air and glass
respectively the index of refraction is
a physical value for a material that is
essentially how much slower light
travels through it compared to light in
a vacuum as examples here are some
indices of refraction air is just about
one it's very close to vacuum Diamond is
very different than class and so that's
one thing that differentiates them when
the index of refraction of the second
material is greater than the first the
effect is that the sine of the angle
must be smaller to compensate this means
the angle from the normal becomes
smaller in other words light bends
towards the normal when going from air
to glass the effect is reversed in the
other direction going from glass to air
causes the light to bend at a greater
angle this is what refraction mapping
does it changes the direction of the
light passing through the transparent
object however real objects have at
least two refraction events when light
passes through them both when entering
and exiting the surface refraction
mapping does just the one refraction
refraction mapping is not quite as
convincing as a reflection mapping in my
opinion part of the reason is that the
distortions produced are not as complex
as the real thing more importantly all
that you can ever see through these
transparent objects as the environment
map nothing else notice with the spheres
demo lovely as it is that you can't see
any spheres through any other spheres
it's possible to make this happen but it
is a lot of extra computation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
