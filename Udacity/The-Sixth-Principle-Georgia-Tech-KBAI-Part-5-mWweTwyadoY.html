AI agents make use of recurring patterns
in the problems they solve these agents
are likely to see similar problems over
and over again and make use of the
underlying patterns behind these similar
problems to solve them more easily we
talked about this first with learning by
recording cases here we assume that we
had a library of cases and that the
solution to a former case would be the
exact solution to a new problem Ashok's
example of tying shoelaces was similar
to this when we tie our shoelaces we
aren't re solving the problem of tying
our shoelaces inscribe instead we're
just taking the solution from an earlier
time late diner shoelaces and doing it
again we assume the solution to the old
problem will solve this new similar
problem in case based reasoning however
we talked about how the exact solution
to an old problem won't always solve new
problems instead sometimes we have to
adapt an old problem here we assume that
there were recurring patterns in the
world that would help us solve these new
and novel problems based on previous
experiences even though the new
experience is novel the pattern is
similar to a prior experience analogical
reasoning is very deeply rooted in this
principle here we explicitly talked
about the idea of taking patterns from
one problem abstracting them and
transferring them to a problem in a
different domain whereas in case based
reasoning the pattern was within a
domain here the pattern can span
different domains in configuration we
assume that the underlying design the
underlying plan for a certain device or
product was pretty similar each time but
there are certain variables that had to
be defined for an individual instance of
that object in a chair example the
overall design of a chair is a recurring
problem they all have legs they all have
seeds say all effects but the individual
details of a specific chair might differ
now it might be tempting to think that
this is actually at odds with the
previous principle the knowledge-based
AI agents consult novel problems here
we're saying that knowledge based AI
agents solve recurring problems based on
recurring patterns but in fact these are
not mutually exclusive knowledge-based
AI agents leverage recurring patterns in
the world but they do so in conjunction
with other reasoning methods to allow
them to also address novel problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
