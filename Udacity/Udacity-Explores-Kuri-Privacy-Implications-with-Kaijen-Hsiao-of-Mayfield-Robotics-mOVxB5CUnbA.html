extremely important people need to know
that they can trust the robot and the
data that the robot takes and that is
not going to be it's not going to be a
literal spambot taken over to do
nefarious things and it's not going to
spread their pictures and video of their
kids all over the Internet and so we've
built in privacy protections encryption
certificates all that sort of thing
from the very start and carry everything
is locked down everything is encrypted
even down to he's a secure boot for his
bootloader so you know one can upload
software to him that he boots on him
that is not the stuff that we wanted to
be running on the robot he uses rotating
certificates he uses encryption
everywhere to the level of it's the same
thing that you would use for bank to
bank transfers or for medical records
it's very lockdown also in terms of
privacy in the home there are places in
your home that you wouldn't want curry
to take pictures in and so we have no-go
zones you can specify I don't want any
pictures taken in the bedroom I don't
want any pictures taking in the bathroom
and creatable not take pictures there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
