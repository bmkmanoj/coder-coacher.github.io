as the primary way to share resources
course headers permit cross-origin
requests without relying on JavaScript
though they do need some server side
code course or does allow servers to
specify a set of origins are allowed to
access resources if the request referer
header is on that list it will be able
to inspect the answer and use the data
problem solved however if you take a
closer look you will realize it by the
time the server sends back the headers
the request will already have executed
this can become problematic with
destructive operations because it is
already too late to ignore the request
this is where pre-flight requests come
into play a pre-flight request uses the
options method and allows the browser to
signal that it only wants to check what
is allowed and what is not server should
not execute any kind of business logic
but only return the headers similar to a
head request however not all requests
will be preflighted requests that are
made because of image tags or forms will
not be preflighted so any kind of get
request will be sent straight away you
just won't be able to read the answer if
course doesn't allow it the details
about when pre-flight requests are
actually sent with course are intricate
and extensive so I'll leave a link with
details in the instructor notes now we
have a couple of ways to get around the
single origin restriction if you're ever
involved in publishing an API yourself
I'd encourage you to think about course
from the very beginning and to enable it
on your server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
