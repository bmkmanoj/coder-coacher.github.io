beginning with associations associations
are denoted by solid lines connecting to
class rectangles here's an example of a
UML class diagram containing two
relationships and three classes we have
the polygon class the point class and a
graphics bundle class between polygon
and point we have a association called
contains that is a polygon contains
points the little filled triangle to the
right of the word contains means that
when reading aloud that particular
relationship you would read from left to
right so polygon contains point you
wouldn't say point contains polygon you
would say something like point is
contained by polygon the second
Association at the bottom between
graphics bundle and polygon isn't named
directly this is fine we'll see that we
can describe it using rolls which are
ways of saying giving similar
information about how the Association is
relating the two to two classes there's
lots of possible notational affordances
for associations you can have a name as
in contains you can have Association
classes they weren't shown in this
diagram but we'll look at them a little
bit later and you can have aggregation
and composition in the example we saw
both of these the open diamond indicated
aggregation and the closed that is the
filled diamond indicated composition in
both cases we are saying that the two
classes are related by some kind of
containment relationship that is a
polygon is made up of points we saw
reading direction that was the filled
filled triangle we can also express
navigability which is the appearance of
an arrowhead on one end of or both ends
of the Association line this indicates
that the primary access pattern for
those classes is in the direction of the
arrow that is we're going to be going
normally from polygons to their points
and not in the other direction you can
express multiplicity in the diagram we
saw star we saw three dot dot star star
means any number of instances three dot
dot star means between three and any
number of instances we also saw a
property ordered which indicates that at
least for the case of the polygon and
its points those points are in a
particular order they might be for
example in clockwise order not shown in
the example diagram is the ability in
UML two UML class model diagrams to
express associations which involve more
than two classes in our text browser
example there were three classes
involved and we use a rhombus into which
the various lines the various lines come
in to indicate all the participants
within that particular Association we
saw also the fact that you could have
role names the word bundle adjacent to
the graphics bundle class indicates the
graphics bundle is playing the role of
bundle in that particular Association
you can have these role names on either
or both ends of the Association line or
you don't need to have them at all also
not shown are the fact that you can
express qualification you can think of
qualification as as indicating what are
the keys into the set of instances
we'll see an example of that in a minute
and you can express also certain
constraints on the Association for
example that they're ordered that
they're frozen that is the Association
can't change that you can only add
things to it and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
