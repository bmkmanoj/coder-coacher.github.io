your own great you really don't need to
understand any more about how this works
to start developing code and doing more
interesting things when queries come in
but I do want to explain a bit more
about what's going on here so the
important thing the web application does
is map requests so here's the URL that
came from the browser that means the
browser's sending a request to the
service running on port 8080 on
localhost containing this is the request
so that message will come from their
browser and this could be a browser
running on your own machine if it's
localhost but it could be a browser
running anywhere in the world and the
request that comes in will be to get the
slash followed by hummus that request
will come into the machine and look for
the process that's running on port 8080
we don't have a physical port that
corresponds to this but the operating
system keeps track of what process is
running where and that's the process
that started when we started running
their web application and what happened
when that code started running the web
application is it started listening in
on that port so requests would be
directed to this web application and
what the application server will do is
call the get method of lucky search
passing in as the query to value hummus
that came in as the query in the get
request and the key line is this one
this creates an instance of the
application class in the web module and
the first input here provides a way of
mapping requests to the class with the
get method that will handle them and
we'll talk more about that in a second
when in the get method gets called it
returns the string that goes back
through the application class which adds
some extra headers around it to make it
work as a response and that gets sent
back to the browser which renders it as
we see here so what is going on with
this mysterious input that tells the web
application how to map requests to class
that's what we'll talk about next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
