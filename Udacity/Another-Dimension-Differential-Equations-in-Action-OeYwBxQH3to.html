dimension more heat conduction in 2d so
we're talking about the temperature
distribution that depends on time on X
and as a premier on why one way for
visualizing this is a movie each frame
of the movie depicts the temperature
distribution in x and y at that precise
instant of time then we come to the next
frame of the movie which shows us the
next distribution in x and y and so on
and so on and what we expect to see is
diffusion if there's only one hot spot
at the beginning it should gradually
dilute over time the heat equation in
two dimensions does not contain any
surprise the partial derivative of the
temperature with respect to time equals
thermal diffusivity times the second
derivative of the temperature with
respect to X plus the second derivative
of temperature with respect to Y notice
I'd this expression is often called the
laplace operator applied to t don't
confuse this triangle with the Delta
it's also often called the laplacian you
can imagine the laplace operator to
measure something like the bend of a
surface in two dimensions and there's a
very simple fine a different scheme for
that differential equation as well now
we're looking at one point at the
current time and the current values left
and right below and above to compute the
next value at that central position that
next value is the temperature after one
time step at x and y and we can spell
out our estimate this is the value
before x 0 x and y plus the time step
times the diffusivity / the spatial step
size squared and now we get lots of
terms the values of our function to the
left to the right below and above all at
time zero to the left x minus delta x to
the right x plus delta x below y minus
delta x and above y plus Delta X
hopefully it's not overly confusing that
I
using delta x 2 also denote the
increment of Y now that we've covered
the outer point the inner point remains
in one dimension we had to subtract
twice the value of the inner point in
two dimensions we have to subtract four
times its value it's easy to see that
this has to be a factor of four imagine
that it's equal to 100 Kelvin everywhere
then we get 100 plus 100 plus plus makes
four hundred we subtract 4 x 100 so we
get zero the new temperature will be the
old temperature as it has to be there is
nothing that could be smoothed out if
the temperature is already constant in
space this factor of four also hints at
what's going to happen with instability
we have to be even more picky about the
step size it can only be half as large
as in the one dimensional case and the
ugly art effects that we are going to
see close to instability are
checkerboard patterns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
