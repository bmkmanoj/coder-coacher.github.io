to be with us today definitely you're
the chief technology officer well scent
of and local company here in Atlanta and
the company has an interesting founding
story could you briefly tell us about
that yeah absolutely two
brother-in-law's we're really talking
over Christmas drinks one of one of the
brother-in-law's was dr. Paul Taylor and
he was producing reports in Excel for
payers trying to summarize his own
quality using claims data and it was
just way too cumbersome very difficult
and inaccurate and the other
brother-in-law was working at patient
care technologies I was a software
designer and they realized they hey this
is a trend that really needs to happen
physicians need to be paid on quality
long term and there's absolutely a
market here they stayed small for four
or five years invested a lot in the
product delivered real results to
significant customers in the Michigan
area and I joined about three years ago
and I had a unique history that followed
along with their path as well I worked
at med kwiste and in modal there I saw
20 terabytes of rich text files of pure
narrative and we said we have to tap
into that information but natural
language processing and the the
different context that you might look at
that narrative text in offered many many
challenges that I felt would take a long
time to really get to the value that I
wanted to get to so I then looked at a
company called outcomes health
information solutions and what they did
was they literally put nurses on site
picked up a paper medical record scanned
it uploaded it to another bank of nurses
that would read the paper and then
essentially abstract the information to
answer a specific question that a pair
would have and payers would pay eighty
dollars a chart for that process to
happen it was a mess an absolute
nightmare of a workflow
that led to lower data quality and
higher costs the whole time I was there
I said can't we get this data directly
out of the EHR and lo and behold three
years ago I found this company well
scented that was working on exactly that
that's a great story in lesson 10 we'll
talk a bit more about feature selection
out of natural language of records and I
guess these nurses were the we're the
first generation of technology for doing
that yeah absolutely so let's segue
forward to today today you're gathering
data from lots of doctors practices and
E a nose can you give us those numbers
yeah we have about a thousand practices
8,000 physicians we have over 2500
interfaces pumping data into our data
center every day we process about 200
million data points clinical data points
every month and one of my favorite stats
is that we have sent a hundred and
seventy eight million transactions to
payers that have resulted in a
value-based reimbursement payment and
now it's all based on clinical quality
okay that sounds like a lot of stuff
from a lot of sources how do you do it
ah that's a that's easier asked and
answered but it really comes down to
being aggressive with respect to seeking
out the data so that means that for our
customers what we need to do is we need
to go to them and say you know what I
don't care what format of the data you
have your system exports data somehow
someway it's just a file format people
have been parsing files for a long long
time so we just roll up our sleeves and
we have a flexible platform that allows
us to administer many different types of
format parsing many different types of
protocols and it creates a queue of
processing an enterprise service bus of
processing that allows us to process and
interpret that data as we hit our
application and put that data into a
structured form in application side and
I want to emphasize that you're not just
collecting quality metrics which the
student should know are relatively
standard
at this point but you're collecting
clinical data from EMRs and of course by
now the students have already seen that
way they've seen some of the things you
do how do you normalize and standardize
that clinical data when it comes from
200 different EMRs the key to that is
being what we say Purpose Driven we
don't try to boil the ocean and
standardize every data point that we
find in each document we work with the
provider organization to say what are
your clinical quality goals and and how
are you going to be paid based on this
data and we specifically look at all the
file formats that they give us and we
pick out the pieces of data that relate
to those clinical quality measures and
so that first simplifies the problem and
allows us to really focus on data
quality within that specific domain then
we essentially maintain a dictionary of
all code sets and we have over 2.2
million mappings that we have curated
over the past eight years that relate
the customers custom dictionaries to all
of the national standard dictionaries
that exist out there well what about the
patient in all of this this is clinical
data from the EMR how do you manage
probably obvious privacy and security
concerns well it's very important you
know and I actually respect a lot the
HITECH Act when we've went to our first
HIPAA risk assessment you get pretty
nervous but as you go through it you
realize that it's a very healthy process
they have a long checklist of about 170
something regulations that as we went
through it we just made sure that we hit
on each of those and and that we're
diligent and respectful internally to
our organization our people deal with
clinical data all day long they're
helping our customers measure clinical
quality and so quite a bit of Education
within the company about how to handle
that data responsibly is required so a
patient like the make-believe chronic
multi chronic disease patient Marla that
we've created for this course who's
going to lots of different specialists
becomes a real challenge to know where
is her record who's caring for and
how do you define quality in a patient
like yeah that's very very tricky so one
of the biggest problems that Marla
composes is not going to the doctor at
all and how do you know if you're
missing clinical data maybe you just
don't have that interface maybe you
don't have that relationship with that
doctor that she went to see and so well
I think what's happening right now is
that provider organizations that are a
single legal structure or entity they're
starting to solve this problem
internally and and it goes to some other
topics like the rollout of direct and
the role of hie s is if you're solving
this problem internally to that provider
organization that legal structure how do
the community structures that are
outside of that organization participate
well you mentioned direct which is one
of the technologies that I mentioned
frequently here in the course what do
you see as the role of direct in in this
complex mix of doctors patients and
quality metrics that you've laid out
Wilson of is is unique and that we're
both in analytics and population health
management clinical quality system but
we're also meaningful use certified and
we do that for a couple of reasons one
because there's always a point of care
aspect to clinical quality but two we
have to play nicely with all of the
standards that are out there with all of
the core point of care EHRs and so that
means supporting direct and supporting
standards like CCDA the problem with the
industry right now is that direct is a
very flexible technology once set up
there's quite a bit of set up quite a
bit of administration to getting it set
up and what we're seeing is that
internally to that provider organization
that we were talking about it's much
easier just to bring the data in
directly from the EMRs and not worry so
much about the protocols and the
directed aspect of direct which means a
provider can direct a chart to another
provider we see direct is really being
more of the protocol for bringing data
from external to that provider
organization from the aah I and those
those structures are really just getting
adopted by the communities and by the
provider organizations today well one
final question and then I'll let you go
put on your your crystal ball glasses
and tell us where you think we're going
in the area of population health quality
measurement and even outcome based
incentives yeah absolutely I this is a
fascinating space I'm very honored to be
part of solving these problems in the
industry the most fundamental problem in
the industry today is again saying how
do we pay based on quality versus paying
based on a fee-for-service action a
single action and because the patients
are consumer and they can go to many
different places you end up having data
that contributes to the quality spread
across multiple systems so you then have
to bring that data together to really
assess the total quality in this comes a
lot of deep questions about who is
responsible for each of the quality
actions but also which record do I look
at across these different EHRs or in the
population health management system to
determine that quality action was taken
the FTC has created clinical integration
Network guidelines that essentially say
that a provider organization cannot
contract with payers unless they are
clinically integrated in what that means
is that they the organization has to
behave as one unit from a clinical
quality perspective they have to be
following the same standards processes
and procedures that's easier said than
done and so workflows and health systems
need to modify their internal structures
and their internal investments over time
to be able to even allow this workflow
in the physician workflow to understand
the entire spectrum of a longitudinal
patient record so what's happening there
is is that's getting refined once we
achieve physician engagement in that
process and we have high data quality I
then expect patient engagement and the
empowerment of the consumer and
healthcare to really flourish I think
it's going to stagnate until then
but after that I really see patient
engagement taking off and putting the
power of the the incentive the power of
the care but also the incentives into
the patients and yeah I couldn't agree
more i think the whole roll of the
patient and patient engagement just
keeps becoming more and more prominent
as time goes it is well I want to thank
you again you've not only given us an
interesting technologies story which
weaves in many of the themes of the
course but a great entrepreneurial story
of two two guys having a drink and now
we have a major company in the
population health space so absolute very
much thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
