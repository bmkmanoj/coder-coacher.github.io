only we don't have a graphical interface
it only makes sense that we're currently
residing in some place on this computer
we're within some directory in which
whatever we type will be executed from
this is called our working directory
when if you log into a Linux machine
you're automatically placed in your
users home directory we can confirm this
by typing the command PWD as you can see
the result of this is slash home slash
vagrant let's unpack this a little bit
the slash is the root level of the file
system it's the absolute highest you can
go in a Linux file system everything on
the machine is in some way a child of
the root level usually through a variety
of other directories home is a directory
you will find within all Linux systems
and it houses all the home directories
of each user with a few exceptions if we
CD into this directory and then list its
contents will see that there is a
directory for each user on this machine
including our current user vagrant so
let's go back into our own home
directory and see what's there this is
our personal space to store stuff but
the operating system has already placed
a few files they are for us if we just
run LS we won't get any results so we'll
need to provide a few flags to LS to
modify its behavior will add the dash a
flag which tells it to show all the
files including hidden ones on a Linux
system any file that begins with a dot
is considered a hidden file we're going
to add one more flag to the LS command
that is the L flag which will list the
results in long format and provide a bit
more information now there's a lot of
info here and will eventually go over
most of it for now I want you to just
focus on the first character and the
names themselves if the first character
is addy that's a directory if it's a
dash that's a file so you can see here
that the dot SSH and cash are both
directories the rest of these are files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
