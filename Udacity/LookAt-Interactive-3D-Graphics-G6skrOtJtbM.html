this box in space actually gets
positioned and defined internally first
we define our camera object as looking
down the world's negative z-axis and
orient it so that the top of the camera
is facing along the plus y axis the
camera starts at the origin just like
other objects the first step is to move
the camera to where we want to make an
image from we also tilt and orient the
camera as desired this is similar to how
we've been orienting objects all along
we define some sort of rotation and
translation to get the camera into place
we ignore scale we're just trying to set
up the camera in space giving the camera
position is simple enough to compute the
rotation needed to orient our camera we
use what's called a look at system this
is pretty much what it sounds like you
define a target location for what
direction you want the camera to look
this defines the negative z-axis for the
cameras frame of reference in other
words how it's pointing in the world so
here I have a real live camera it even
works and with my z-axis here that tells
me which way it's pointing but
unfortunately it doesn't tell me which
way is up it still has this one degree
of freedom so what we do is we also
define an up Vector of some sort this
vector gives us some guidance as to
which way to orient the top of the
camera typically in three J s will pass
in a vector such as 0 1 0 the plus y
axis as the F vector given our view
vector in this up vector we'd like to
form a matrix that defines a whole frame
of reference for a camera we know where
we want the z axis to look along but we
want to know where the cameras y and x
axis end up by specifying a general up
direction we do this for example say we
have a camera pointing in some direction
looking long its negative z-axis if we
give an upturn we can find the direction
pointing to the right of the camera
which is the x axis by taking the cross
product of this z axis and our up vector
now we have two axes locked down camera
z and camera X we can find the true up
direction the cameras Y axis by then
taking the cross product of the X and z
axis remember that the cross product of
two vectors will give us a vector that's
perpendicular to both of them this may
all sound a bit odd and like a lot of
work but is extremely common it's
probably the place where I use the cross
product the most the whole point here is
that given a view direction and an up
vector as a hint we can get a frame of
reference for the camera will often use
the world's plus y axis as our up vector
but it all depends say were a hawk
soaring over some terrain we're looking
straight down which would be looking
down the y-axis of our world if we use
the world's y-axis as our hint it
doesn't make much sense we define the
negative z-axis the cameras looking
along and the y-axis for the cameras up
direction as vectors in exactly opposite
directions this is not very useful in
this case our up vector is more like the
direction pointing out at the top of our
Hawks head the direction it's flying
now that the up vector is not parallel
to the look at direction we can form a
good frame of reference for the hawk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
