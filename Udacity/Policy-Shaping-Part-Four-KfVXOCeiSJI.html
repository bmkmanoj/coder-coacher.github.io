the case where there can be only one
policy and that's because for the very
reason that we we described in the first
quiz where if I know with certainty
there's only one policy and I know with
certainty the human gives me the right
answer
the moment you tell me that some action
is correct I now know something about
the other actions so it becomes
complicated somehow what you've told me
about a second action tells me something
about the first action and when you go
through all the math it's still it's
still a multinomial and when you go
through all the math and do the
derivation and the derivations available
for the students you end up with this
quantity that the probability that a
particular action a is optimal given a
sequence of labels is what we've seen
before it's C raised to the Delta sub a
times 1 minus C raised to all the other
evidence that we have from the other
actions and then there's a normalization
factor which I don't write out here and
this this corresponds to what we did in
the last example where we wrote out 0.8
0.2 and point 2 and then normalized
everything else let me make sure I
understand that so we have 1.20 the
Delta is 1 yes
no but it's 0 for the other guys what's
Delta J Delta J is for the other actions
yes this is the difference between the
times you said yes and no for every
other action that isn't the particular
action you're asking about so this
provides evidence from the other actions
oh I see and then we're going to
normalize so so maybe maybe that
squiggle equals wants to be like an
alpha like a proportional to symbol yeah
sure I wiggle you know where I grew up
in the South that meant approximately
but there that make you feel better much
better because it's not really
approximately it's actually proportional
to which means we're gonna have to
normalize afterwards so that we get the
0.8 we get a point two and a point two
and then when we normalize that we get
the 2/3 one six one six awesome exactly
and the right thing kind of happens
there and you could write out what the
normalization factor is and then we
don't have to have an outfitter we can
have an equals but it's big long and
hairy and it's just much simpler to
actually ignore it do this part which is
really easy and then do the
normalization afterwards more to the
point since what we care about is a
policy we only care about which one's
maximum we don't actually care about the
actual probability I'm forgetting why we
care about a policy
remember because we're trying to because
ultimately we're combining this
information to figure out what action to
take right got it if all we're doing is
listening to human beings then when a
human tells us something we want to pick
the action that's most likely to be
optimal and so it doesn't matter what
the actual probability as long as we
have the ordering right and so we don't
have to normalize we don't have to know
the probability we just have to make
certain we get the maximum one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
