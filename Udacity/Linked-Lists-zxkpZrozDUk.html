sense to you let's quickly look at them
in another way you can think of an array
kind of like this it's a set of boxes
where each has an address called an
index this paper chain is more similar
to a construct called
a linked list a linked list is an
extension of a list but it's definitely
not an array there's still some things
that have order but there are no indices
instead a linked list is characterized
well by its links each element has some
notion of what the next element is since
it's connected to it but not necessarily
how long the list is or where it is in
the list an array is different there's
nothing in one element of the array that
says here's your next element you know
what the next element is by what the
next index is my first thought when I
heard this was why would anybody ever
want to use a linked list an array gives
you more information since you already
know where the next element falls in the
array however as we discussed before
adding and removing elements from an
array can be really complicated adding
and removing elements from a linked list
turns out to be so easy by comparison
you can actually just take an element
out or add one in there's only one real
quick consideration here but we'll talk
about that in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
