era in Internet security with three
major worm outbreaks these three major
worms were code red one version two Code
Red two and nimda let's take a quick
look at each of these worms code red one
was released on July 13th 2001 and was
the first modern worm it exploited a
buffer overflow in microsoft's iis
server from the first through the 20th
of each month it would spread by finding
new targets using a random scan of IP
address space it would spawn 99 new
threads which generated IP addresses at
random and then looked for vulnerable
instances of i is now version 2 of code
red one was actually released six days
later and fixed the random scanning bug
so that each instance of the worm scan a
different part of IP address space after
the scanning bug was fixed the worm was
able to compromise 350,000 vulnerable
hosts in a matter of only 14 hours by
most estimates that was the complete set
of hosts running the vulnerable version
of iis on the entire internet the
payload of this worm was to mount a
denial of service attack on
whitehouse.gov but a bug in the coding
caused the worm to die on the 20th of
each month if the victims clock was
wrong however the worm would actually
resurrect itself on the first
fortunately in this case the payload
which launched the denial of service
attack on whitehouse.gov actually was
launched at a particular IP address not
at the domain name so the operators of
the website needed only to move the web
server to a different IP address to
defend against the denial of service
attack a better worm design would have
been much more catastrophic CodeRed to
exploited the same vulnerability but had
a completely different payload it was
released on August 4th 2001 and was
called Code Red - mainly because of a
comment in the code the worm actually
only spread on Windows 2000 it actually
crashed on Windows NT
the scan actually preferred nearby
addresses it would choose addresses from
the same / 8 with probability 1/2 from
the same / 16 with probability 3/8 and
randomly from the entire internet with
the remaining 1/8 probability the reason
for preferring nearby IP addresses was
that if there was one vulnerable hosts
on the network there was likely to be
more because the same administrator that
failed to patch the compromised machine
might have other machines on the same
network that were also vulnerable this
notion of preferential scanning can
speed up infections in some cases by
increasing the probability that scanning
will find another vulnerable host the
payload of this worm was an IAS backdoor
and the worm was completely dead by
design by October 1st 2001 nimda was
released on September 18 2001 and was
interesting mostly because it spread
using multiple propagation vectors it
was effectively multimodal so in
addition to using the same iis
vulnerability as code red one and code
red - there were some additional vectors
that it used it could spread by bulk
email as an attachment it copied itself
across open Network shares its installed
an exploit code on web pages on the
corresponding web server running on the
machine so that any browser that visited
the web page for that server would
become infected itself and it would scan
for the code red - backdoors that that
worm had installed the interesting thing
about the multimodal nature of the nimda
worm is that signature base defenses
don't necessarily help because of the
many ways that it could spread for
example by email or via a website
exploit nimda actually leaps firewalls
most of the firewalls passed the emails
carrying nimda completely untouched it
was a brand new infection with an
unknown signature and the scanners
couldn't detect it this was the first
of a worm that exploited what we would
call a zero-day attack which is when an
worm first appears in the wild and the
signature of the worm is not extracted
until minutes or hours later zero day
attacks are particularly virulent
because the worm can spread extremely
quickly before any type of
signature-based anti virus has a chance
to catch up and prevent the infections
in the first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
