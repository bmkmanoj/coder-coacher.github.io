bagging that strives to improve the
learners by focusing on areas where the
system is not performing well one of the
most well known algorithms in this area
is called adaboost and I believe it's a
de not a de because add a stands for
adaptive here's how adaboost works we
build our first bag of data in the usual
way we select randomly from your
training data we then try in a model in
the usual way the next thing we do and
this is something different we take all
of our training data and use it to test
the model and we're going to discover
that some of the points in here are exes
and our Y's are not well predicted so
there's going to be some points in here
for which there is significant error now
when we go to build our next bag of data
again we choose randomly from our
original data but each instance is
weighted according to this error so
these points that had significant error
are more likely to get picked and to go
into this bag than any other individual
instance so as you see we ended up with
a few of those points in here and a
smattering of all the other ones as well
we build a model from this data and then
we test it now we test our system
altogether in other words we've got a
sort of miniature ensemble here of just
two learners but we test both of them we
test them by inputting again this in
sampled data we test on each instance
and we combine their outputs and again
we measure error across all this data
maybe this time these points got modeled
better but there were some other ones up
here that weren't as good and thus we
build our next bag and our next model we
just continue this over and over and
over again up until M or the total
number of bags we're going to be using
so to recap bagging when we build one of
these instances is simply choosing some
subset of the data at random with
replacement and you create each bag in
the same way
boosting is an add-on to this idea where
in subsequent bags we choose those data
instances that have been modeled poorly
in the overall system before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
