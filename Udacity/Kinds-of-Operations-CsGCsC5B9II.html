want to do on by an area images so you
know often what you want to do is you
want to separate objects one from
another that are sort of accidentally
touching and you want to collect
together pixels that all belong to the
same object and then another thing you
might want to do is compute the features
of a binary object and we actually did
this also whenever we talked about Hugh
moments and we're talkin bout moments in
general and moments are a descriptor of
the shape of a binary patch and so again
those are things that you do on binary
images so here's an example this was a
thresholded red blood cell image and by
the way in the old days that's so old in
fact mom sorry my mother but I think her
first job out of college was as a
medical technician one of the things you
had to do was count white blood cells in
under a microscope and for certain
amount and you would count the density
actually people sometimes still do that
even today but what you really like to
do is spread out a bunch of blood cells
and have a machine do the counting how
many red blood cells how many white
buses especially if instead of just
doing a patient at a time you were doing
a mass of study and you had tens of
thousands of samples you wanted counted
right so here's an example of taking an
image fresh holding it and you know if I
were to ask you to count how many bread
blood cells there were you could
probably find all of the well let's
start with one that's easy right you say
AHA here's one that's pretty separated
no problem here's another one oh but
this is a weird one look at that it's
got a hole in it and here are two those
are probably too right but it's one blob
connected by a thin thing so you'd
really like to be able to take this
image and then fix it up you know
because in this particular image there
were 63 separate objects detected and a
normal blood cell has an area of about a
50 but you'll notice there are some
things here where obviously there were
things that were touching each other
that were counted as single cells when
actually they were gobs and then there
were things that were really small right
and so here they were just using the
number to determine which kinds of
things or cells and what you'd like to
do is you'd like to be able to separate
out
each one of those cells so we're going
to do some binary image operations to do
that and what kind of operations are
there well first one we're going to talk
just a little bit about is threshold
encouraged you have to go from a color
or grayscale image that has continuous
values or lots of values to something
that just has 20 and ones so determining
a threshold is always a challenge then
what you'd like to do is you'd like to
find all the pixels that are connected
and that's called connected components
analysis and we'll we'll talk about that
that one's used a lot also to find the
independent blobs and then you want it
sometimes improve those blobs and that's
referred to as morphology and we're
going to talk about a variety of
morphological operators including some
of the more important ones then once
you've done all that then you may
compute some features on those blobs
like I've talked about before moments
areas these kinds of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
