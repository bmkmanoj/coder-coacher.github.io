this study of social psychology and
social behavior and that is the
unfortunate bias of prejudice and
resulting discrimination prejudice is a
biased attitude toward a group of people
or an individual member of a group based
on unfair generalizations about what
members of that group are like such
prejudicial thinking is often the result
of stereotypes instead of resulting from
a careful observation of people's
behavior if we have a prejudice that is
based on race or ethnicity we call that
racism or if we have a prejudice based
on the sexes we call that sexism there
is a lot of very interesting research
especially in the area of industrial
organizational psychology that looks at
both prejudice and discrimination so
remember that prejudice is a biased
attitude but when they attitude changes
to behavior we see that discrimination
can occur discrimination is a
preferential treatment of certain people
usually driven by prejudicial attitudes
psychologists have suggested that
prejudice operates both inside and
outside of our awareness that is we may
be aware of our prejudice but we may
also hold a prejudicial view without
being aware of it now how do we know
this and how can we measure it to
researchers banaji and Greenwald
suspected that there was a disconnect
between people's conscious and
unconscious views of prejudice and they
developed a very interesting way to
measure this go to the link below in the
instructors notes section and take the
test for racism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
