been used in the sequential games
setting the stochastic games yeah no
solution concepts are usually useful in
all those things yeah oh you should
mention one other thing which is we
actually pointed out that something that
we talked about last time it was in fact
a solution concept but Nash Nash and o
sub game perfect right by the way worth
pointing out that the King Solomon
alternative that I described before it's
okay imperfect all right well so let's
let's flip over to that which is
mechanism designed we talked about two
things in particular we talked about
peer teaching right and we talked about
King Solomon finding up babies baby
division never ever divide by zero hmm
now what's interesting about mechanism
design sort of the flip side or
complement of what we normally think
about in playing games is that one could
look at a lot of these solution concepts
as in fact being mechanism design mmm
right you create Coco values as a way of
encouraging certain kinds of behavior by
setting up binding side payments you
think of correlated equilibria as
working because you've created a
mechanism this shared source of
randomization that will encourage
behavior that it wouldn't otherwise and
courage therefore all these solution
concepts can be thought of sort of at
least all the ones beyond the kind of
obvious one the Nash equilibria many way
I have to think about that can be
thought of as a kind of mechanism design
these extensions these things that we
introduce our to induce certain kinds of
behavior and so even if we didn't want
to think too hard about mechanism design
I wanted to believe it wasn't really a
part of reinforcement learning it really
is because all of these things that we
come up with as these sort of extensions
solution concepts are really about
getting better outcomes and they're all
about driving behavior using rewards
right which is so much better than
driving this data mmm so I think that's
everything that we've learned okay so
what's next I I think we're done
actually with the material we have kind
of a wrap up that we need to do like an
outro and so yeah so we're
down to the to the near terminal state
nice well I think that's good well this
has been fun I mean I guess I will get
to see you again after this because we
do have a few things that we need to do
but I think we've covered all the
material Wow well done all right well
good job everybody yeah good job um I
guess I will see you later Michael bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
