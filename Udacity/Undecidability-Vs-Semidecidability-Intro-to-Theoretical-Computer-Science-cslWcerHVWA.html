theoretical computer science is very
precise there are sometimes very
confusing naming conventions and since
many students at least those that i have
had get confused by this I just quickly
wanted to clear one thing up you will
sometimes read that the halting problem
is semi decidable and we have just say
that it's undecidable so which one of
those two is it is it undecidable or is
it halfway decidable and paradoxically
it's both and let me explain you why so
assume that we have a program p and we
want to determine if it halts so we want
to know does the program stop at a
certain point in time and the answer to
that as you know can either be yes or no
now let's think about the two cases that
are possible so the first one of those
two cases is that pee stops and my
question for you is if p does stop can
we expect a yes after a finite amount of
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
