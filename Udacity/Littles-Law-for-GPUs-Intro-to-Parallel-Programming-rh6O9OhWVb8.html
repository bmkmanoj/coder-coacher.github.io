recap littles law states that the number
of useful bytes delivered is equal to
the average latency of memory
transaction times the bandwidth now what
are some implications of this first of
all there's a minimum latency to take a
signal or a piece of data all the way
from an SM to somewhere on the DRAM or
to take information from the DRAM and
pull it into an SM okay you can find the
details for your particular GPU online
but in general any DRAM transaction is
going to take hundreds of clock cycles
and by the way this isn't a GPU thing
this is true of all modern processors a
clock cycle on a modern chip takes half
a nanosecond for example on a 2
gigahertz chip and even the speed of
light you know light doesn't go very far
in half a man a second and electricity
is even slower especially on the tiny
wires that you find in computer chips so
to go from somewhere inside the GPU off
the chip over a wire somewhere on the
board into the DRAM get a result go all
the way back hundreds and hundreds of
clock cycles many many nanoseconds so
this means that a thread that's trying
to read or write global memory is going
to have to wait hundreds of clocks and
time that it could otherwise be spending
by doing actual computation and this in
turn is why we have so many threads in
flight we deal with this high latency
hundreds of clocks between memory
accesses by having many many threads
that are able to run at any one time so
that after one thread requests piece of
data from global memory or initiates a
store to global memory another thread
can step in and do some computation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
