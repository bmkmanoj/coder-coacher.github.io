to take up some space I'm just going to
do the rest for work over here but know
that this is a continuation of the work
of them doing over on the left side of
the screen so I'll rewrite what we had
before five thirds x plus two equals
four we can't deal with this five thirds
yet we can't get rid of it yet because
it's only multiplying X it's not
multiplying two as well so before we get
to that we need to get rid of the two to
do that we subtract two from each side
and then all we need to do is handle
this coefficient as you've done before
you could either divide by the
coefficient itself so divide by five
thirds we know that when you divide by a
fraction it's the same as multiplying by
the reciprocal so this is similar to
what we talked about in the previous
quiz where we said that dividing by
negative 3 was equivalent to x negative
one-third the same thing is true here
division by 5 thirds is equivalent to
multiplication by three-fifths either
way we'll get rid of the five thirds in
front of the x and then 2 times 3 fifths
is just six fifths and that's our final
answer x equals six fifths like with all
these problems we can take six fifths
and substitute it back into the original
equation we had to check and make sure
that both sides of the equation are
actually equal to each other when we
apply this condition of x equals 6 over
