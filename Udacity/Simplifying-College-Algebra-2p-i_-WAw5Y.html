just two instances of using the
distributive property we want to
multiply each term inside this first set
of parentheses x 3 and we want to
multiply each term within the second set
of parentheses x 150 and now we just
multiply it within each term to simplify
and last but not least we add like terms
and we end up with a final answer of 400
2w + 480 n this is interesting we can
see finally now that everything is
simplified how the number of nozzles
that I've been ordered compares to the
number of wipers that have been ordered
before when we just had 84 w + 60 n as
grants total future earnings there are
clearly more wipers than nozzles in
demand but now the situation is reversed
more nozzles have been ordered than
wipers this is one of the many reasons
why simplifying expressions is really
really helpful when we're doing word
problems when we have things simplified
down as much as we can we're able to see
what real world situations are reflected
by the math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
