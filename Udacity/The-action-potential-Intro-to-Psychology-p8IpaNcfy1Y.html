technical but do try to follow along
it's very very important let's take a
closer look at the action potential or
is it sometimes called the nerve impulse
the action potential is an electrical
impulse that travels along the axon that
is surrounded by a semipermeable
membrane that allows only certain ions
to cross through it
ions are chemically charged particles
that are found inside and outside the
cells in its resting state the fluid
outside the axon contains a higher
concentration positive ions than the
inside of the axon which has many
negatively charged ions this resting
potential was measured at negative 70
millivolts or thousandths of a volt so
neurons do not stay in this resting
state rather they can change and do
change when an impulse increases the
positive charge inside the neuron to a
certain threshold the neuron becomes
locally depolarized to a charge of
positive 40 millivolts and fires an
action potential or a nerve impulse the
action potential travels along the axon
to signal to other neurons more
specifically during an action potential
sodium ions their positive charges enter
the axon after the action potential
occurs potassium ions cross outside the
cells and then the neuron must transport
these ions to return to its resting
state this results in a refractory
period wherein the neuron cannot
generate another action potential this
entire process from start to finish
lasts only about 5 milliseconds r5 one
thousandth of a second so one important
point to make was that every time a
neuron fires it fires to the same degree
or amount goes up to positive 40
millivolts no more and no less this is
known as the all-or-none principle
stronger responses involve simply more
neurons firing not individual neurons
firing more strongly so if you want to
find out more about some of these
technical details you can find that
information on some links that will post
on the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
