we got when we searched for Python and
union and we see the first hit goes to
the Python documentation for sets and if
we follow this we get to that
documentation but the first thing we see
is that this is deprecated deprecated
means that this is something that the
language no longer encourages you to use
and will be eventually removed from the
language and so that's not what we
should use we should use the one that it
links to which is the Dilton set type
and now we see more information about
sets let's see what we get there so we
have a description of the set type and
what it says is a set object is an
unordered collection of hashable objects
well this also is something that
probably doesn't make a lot of sense to
students who have only taken one on one
but let's see if you can figure out on
your own what that means so here's what
it says in the Python documentation
asset object is an unordered collection
of distinct hashable objects the Python
documentation is the definitive
reference on Python but it's often not
the easiest way to understand something
new so your goal is to see if you can
figure out what this means and if you
can you should be able to answer this
quiz correctly so your goal is to
understand what this means and if you
can you should be able to answer this
quiz correctly which is which of these
objects could be in a set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
