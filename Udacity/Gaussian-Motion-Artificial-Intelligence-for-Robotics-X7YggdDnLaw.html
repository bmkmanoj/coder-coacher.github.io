what we've achieved we knew there was a
measurement update an emotion update
which is also called prediction and we
know that the measurement update is
implemented by multiplication
which is the same as Bayes rule and the
emotion update is done by total
probability or an addition so we tackle
the more complicated case this is
actually the harp our mathematically and
we solved it we gave an exact expression
we even derived it mathematically and
you were able to write a computer
program that implements the step of the
common filter I don't want to go into
too much depth here this is a really
really easy step let me write it down
for you suppose you live in a world like
this this is your current best estimate
where you are and this is your
uncertainty and now say you move to the
right side certain distance and that
motion itself has a so instead of
uncertainty then you arrive at a
prediction that adds the emotional
comment to the mean and it has an
increased uncertainty over the initial
uncertainty and intuitive if this makes
sense if you move to the right by this
distance in expectation you are exactly
where you wish to be but you've lost
information because your motion tends to
lose information is manifest by this
uncertainty over here now the math for
this is really really easy
your new mean is your old mean plus the
motion often called you so if you move
over 10 meters this will be 10 meters
and your new Sigma square is your old
Sigma square plus variance of the motion
Gaussian this is all you need to know
it's just an addition and I won't prove
it to you because it's very trivial but
in summary we have a Gaussian over here
we have a Gaussian for the motion with
us the mean and R square as its own
motion uncertainty in the resulting
Gaussian in the Blixen step just adds
these two things up mu plus U and Sigma
square plus R square
since this was so simple let me quiz you
we have a Gaussian before the prediction
step which mu equals 8 and Sigma square
equals 4 we then move to the right a
total of 10 with a motion uncertainty of
6 now describe to me the predicted
Gaussian and give me the new mu and then
use Sigma square</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
