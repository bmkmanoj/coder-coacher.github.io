learning and doing environments they
were detailed in a great book from 1991
called
legitimate peripheral participation and
it basically suggests that novices and
experts work together in certain
environments and the novices actually
learn from the experts while the experts
are doing some tasks and over time the
novices take a little bit of
responsibility and then a little bit
more and learn how to contribute to that
environment while also contributing to
that environment so for an example
that's used in that book is the example
of midwives so when a midwife is first
being trained in certain areas the first
thing she goes through is just being in
the room during childbirth she
experiences the different things that
the experienced midwives are saying and
doing and just kind of gets a feel for
it and then over time she takes on a
couple responsibilities and a couple
more and learns and learns a little bit
more each day and eventually is an
expert herself I'm gonna start training
her own novices it's very apprenticeship
driven approach and in that book they
suggested this is really one of the best
ways to learn because you're learning
right in the authentic context where
you'll ultimately contribute to what you
learned but it presents a lot of
difficulties for classroom learning
because classrooms are completely
opposite of this you very rarely have
classrooms where you really are doing
what you're learning to do you're
learning it in one place the idea being
that you're gonna go out into the world
and then do it in a job or doing a
career but in the classroom you're not
actually contributing but this learning
theory suggests that's the opposite of a
great way to learn so the question is
can we create these kind of environments
where this is simulated where students
are experiencing what it would be like
to contribute a little more over time to
this enterprise that they're trying to
learn technology may be able to help us
with this because with technology we can
create these kinds of simulations we can
simulate whatever career the students
are going to go into and simulate giving
them some of these responsibilities
while AI agents or the simulation itself
takes care of the rest so we'll talk
about the value of this educational
approach as well as how we can use
technology to really bring it to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
