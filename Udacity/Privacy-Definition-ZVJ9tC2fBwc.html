with law and very little time talking
with ethics but then going to move on to
privacy and privacy is something that we
all have some idea of what it is and the
fact that we want it it actually goes
all the way back to Justice Brandeis
famous thing about the right to be left
alone but we want to examine it in the
context of again the online world so
what how do we define privacy in this
context privacy is obviously related to
information about us in this context
it'll be information related to what we
do online and and data that we have in
the digital form so definition basically
is a user's ability to control okay so
that's the key thing here control how
data pertaining to us or our activities
can be collected you can actually
collect such data you do your things you
visit a website you send an email you
make a phone call whatever it is but who
can collect information about these
activities how can this information be
used and tenday the entity that collects
it share it with somebody else then
other company government agency whatever
so it really the focus is on our ability
to control all of these and that's what
privacy is it's our ability to control
information about us and in this case
you're going to focus on information
that is collected shared used in the
online world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
