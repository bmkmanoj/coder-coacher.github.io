download this file fresh tomatoes pie
from the instructor notes once you've
downloaded it make sure you save this
file in the exact same folder as the
Python file where we created all of
these movie instances okay so I'm going
to begin to use the fresh tomatoes file
and then call the function open movies
page now I know that this function open
movies page takes in a list or an array
of movies I do have a bunch of movies
that I've created over here but I do
need to put them all in a list or an
array let me do that next so I will
define an empty array or a list called
movies there it is
and to this list I will add all of the
movies I had created previously
so the first movie to add is Toy Story
next one is avatar
next is School of Rock the next one is
ratatouille it's spelling is a little
difficult I think I got it next in line
is midnight in Paris and the final one
is Hunger Games so there is our movies
array by the way in case you need more
information about lists or arrays you
can find a helpful link in the
instructor notes alright now that I have
a list of movies I can give this list as
input to the open movies page function
let me do that next so I will provide
movies as the argument to open movies
page function there it is now before I
save and run this entire program I know
that I still haven't imported the file
fresh tomatoes in my program so I will
scroll all the way up and import fresh
tomatoes notice that this line of code
will work only the fresh tomatoes file
is in the exact same folder as our
current Python file ok time to save and
run this program and there is our movies
website if I click on any one of the
links its trailer will play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
