build script looks like even without any
explanation it's reasonably easy to
figure out what's going on we have what
kind of looks like a stripped-down JSON
syntax
however down here where it looks like
we're creating a task there's what looks
like a java print line statement what's
going on here is this script just
structured data like JSON or XML or is
this actual Java code well the answer is
that Gradle scripts are written in a
special-purpose build language provided
by Gradle but it's not a language that
was develop from scratch it sits on top
of a generic scripting language called
groovy groovy has a lot of syntactic
sugar and other features that allow us
to write build scripts that look a lot
more like natural language when compared
to using something like Java second
groovy integrates perfectly with Java
which is the language that Gradle
platform is written in the main thing
you need to learn when using Gradle is
the Gradle build language which is where
the keywords like Android and task are
coming from but it also helps a lot to
understand how this build language sits
on top of groovy and Java the entire
build script has what we call a delegate
object which exposes the Gradle build
language - groovy scripting language
within the build script if you write a
Gradle plug-in you could write it in any
language and use the same delegate
object the Gradle build language is also
called the Gradle DSL or domain-specific
language a domain-specific language is a
language that is finely tailored for a
specific task in this case the domain
we're talking about is an Android build
note there's a big difference between
describing your build and providing
explicit instructions on how to actually
make the build happen the Gradle DSL is
declarative so you're only responsible
for describing your build and Gradle
itself knows how to make it happen that
means your build scripts can be much
shorter and much easier to understand
however within the build script you have
a full-blown powerful programming
language at your disposal we do
recommend that you keep build scripts
declarative and try not to pollute it
with low-level logic that's what Gradle
plugins are for you can write them in
any JVM language like Java groovy or
Scala</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
