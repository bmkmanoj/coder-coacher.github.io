illustration from Intel that summarizes
the advances in the Intel VT
architecture over the last decade or so
the lowest set of boxes summarize the
impact of the virtualization related
hardware modifications that have been
added along the three different
dimensions the three dimensions are as
follows vector one refers to any CPU
related modifications and this includes
things like fixing issues with
non-virtual I zabal instructions or
adding support to the CPU for extended
page tables vector 2 refers to
modifications pertaining to the entire
chipset such as chipset side support for
technologies like what's called sr iov
that technologies that help with aya
virtualization or for aya routing and
mechanisms for direct device access or
support rather for direct device access
and then the third vector the third
dimension in which intel has contributed
to the evolution of virtualization
friendly technology is to actually push
advances in the device level technology
so this is what's happening on the
device as opposed to on the cheap you on
the chipset or the CPUs I and with this
trust devices are more easily integrated
in a virtualized environment this
includes things like support on the
device for dma remapping so that it can
appropriately DMA into the correct set
of memory depending on the virtual
machine that it targets and you also
support the multiple cue the multiple
logical interfaces such that different
logical interface can be given to a
different via the architecture versions
that encapsulate these modifications are
referred to as vtx for the modifications
along the first vector with vtx to VT x3
occurring in subsequent generations of
processors then v TD for the advances
along the second dimension with BTD
following and so forth and then the
architecture modifications along the
third vector are encapsulated into which
referred to as I aviso aya
virtualization technology nvmd q what
stands for virtual machine device ques
so this is the vice resident support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
