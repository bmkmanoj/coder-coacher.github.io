let F be a 3-cnf formula with n
variables and M clauses and we'll let a
and K be the result of the
transformation first we show that if f
is satisfiable then there's a subset of
a summing to K we'll let t be the
satisfying assignment then we include
y:i in our set s if X I is true under
the truth assignment and we include Zi
otherwise as for the G and H families if
fewer than three literals of a clause
are satisfied then include G if fewer
than two then include H as well in total
the sum of these numbers must be equal
to K in the other direction we argue
that if there is a subset of a summing
to K then there is a satisfying
assignment suppose that s is a subset of
a summing to K then the impossibility of
carrying the digits in any sum implies
that exactly one of Y I or Zi must have
been set to true therefore we can define
a truth assignment T where T of X I is
true if Y I is included and it's false
otherwise this must satisfy every Clause
otherwise there would be no way that the
total in the clause places could be
three all together we've seen that
subset sum is in NP and we can reduce
3-cnf set an np-complete problem to it
so subset sum must be np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
