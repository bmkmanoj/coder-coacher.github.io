on the right here and okay validation
rules yep excellent new okay rule name I
want to call this valid ticket number
checker has it it's a little weird but
valid ticket number there you go hmm and
description makes sure that you've
bought less than eight tickets yeah and
I mean while we're checking you know bad
data why don't we just make sure that's
also more than zero tickets so at least
one ticket okay that makes sense and
you've bought at least one ticket so the
weird thing about validation rules is
their little backwards the rule that you
create needs to check if the formal is
true which means whatever equation your
building needs to evaluate to true in
order to throw an error message so
basically i want to say instead of
saying making sure make sure it's
between one and eight i wanna make sure
it's not less than 1 or greater than
anything exactly that makes I mean sort
of makes sense but I'll roll with it
okay so i guess i'm going to use this
little hierarchy thing it allows you to
choose fields on the attendee object or
even off of related objects but yeah
just click the fields that you're trying
to add into this formula tickets
purchased i think yeah okay so i make
sure don't want to check if tickets
purchased is greater than eight yep i
can just do that right yep no one do or
how do you or check that insert operator
oh sweet ok or tickets purchased
less than one right okay I'm going to
check to make sure and screw anything up
too bad and this looks pretty similar to
the formula we just made doesn't it yeah
yeah it's cool that you can do all this
with just the mouse okay no where's
found okay error message dude you have
to buy between one and eight tickets
okay safe okay I'm gonna obviously try
and break this rule now so what's great
a new one new attendee maybe Sally
scalper oh nice Sally scalp or you're
not getting through my validation rule
email thief and evil that whatever
purchase source box office she tried to
buy general admission ticket she tried
it by 10 of them for cloud stock let's
see what happens Sally scalper ha she
was foiled she was thwarted in her evil
attempts to scalp tickets ok that's
pretty cool yeah all right Sam this is
pretty cool we did all this object
building and field adding and things are
updating automatically formulas
validation like does your head feel like
it's about to explode no no it's
sexually sorry it's awesome which I mean
so we've only done it for attendees and
festivals I guess next step is to do it
with bands and stages and all that yeah
let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
