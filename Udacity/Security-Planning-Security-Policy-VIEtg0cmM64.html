sort of consists of many different parts
the last one was we talked about
controls next we talk about what we call
a security policy that you have to be
talking really about enterprise security
policy you could have policies at
national level or something like that
federal government may have one across
its different agencies and each agency
may have its own and things like that
but if you think about this in the
context of an enterprise security
planning requires that you have some
sort of a security policy what exactly
is a security policy security policy
really sort of at a high level
articulate what our subject the security
objectives are what is that we want to
what goals do we have we want to
maintain confidentiality you know don't
want to make sure that sensitive data is
not disclosed to parties that are not
authorized to see it we want our systems
to be available we don't want our data
to be corrupted we don't want sensitive
data to get into the hands we want to be
legally compliant or whatever it is you
can think about all kind of sort of
objectives somebody might have which
actually motivate what a policy is so
often this high-level articulation
requires it would include some sort of
illegal business and regulatory
rationale for why the policy has what it
does a legal and regulatory you don't
really have a lot of choice business
reasons tell you why it's good for the
enterprise or for the company and what's
good for the company of course is good
for its employees so that's the
articulation of the underlying reasons
why we want to have a kind of policy
that we do so the policy really is you
know what you should do and what should
not be done so we talked for passwords
for example what kind of password you
should choose what the size length of a
password to be and things like that we
may have web and email policies for
example can you surf the web while you
were at work the policy actually might
say is something were to go wrong if
there is some security event that occurs
what sort of response is that we're
going to have you need if your machine
gets compromised do you have to inform
somebody for example the security policy
or
the do's and don'ts and we saw some
examples of those of course they may
have to do with prevention so bad things
don't happen they may have to do with
detection so compromised how you find
out that there was a breach may have to
do with how we respond to that sort of a
thing and how remediation occurs and of
course it it must address the concerns
and impact and that could any of these
things have so rational articulation of
why things need to be the way the policy
says they should be and if it doesn't
sort of address the concerns and needs
impact it might have on on users of
course the policy may not be well
