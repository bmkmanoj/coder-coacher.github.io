engineer is designing good data
structures this question asks us how do
we modify our index so that we can track
the number of times users click a link
for a given keyword this allows us to
sort the results in our search engine
based on how populated links are let's
go through the choices one by one and
come up with some examples to see the
effects those choices can have on an
implemented search engine given this as
an answer choice it may be a little hard
to reason about what it would look like
if you actually used it in your search
engine so let's come up with an example
the keyword Andy is associated with two
URLs udacity.com and search with Peter
info and the keyword Ervin is associated
with Udacity com and then i have the
counts five and eight ideally for this
to be useful we want to count the number
of times a user clicks the URL given a
certain keyword that way we can sort
these two URLs based on the counts in
order to serve our users better search
results as it stands now there's only
one count for each keyword this might be
useful to count the number of times
people search things but it doesn't help
us solve our problem so this is no good
here I've numerated the second choice
what's useful about this is that we have
a count for each URL in each keyword
this allows us to sort these two URLs we
can add search with peter dunne info
above udacity.com when we display a
results on the web page because users
more often click that link than the
other this seems like a pretty good
choice and it turns out to be the best
one so it gets a check this data
structure doesn't really make that much
sense why do we have multiple counts
corresponding to a single URL you could
imagine a use for it may be that each
count corresponds to a certain period of
time but given what we have here it's
probably not the best data structure for
exactly what we want to do and that is
just sort the queries results based
strictly on the number of clicks for
this one I don't need to even go into an
example this is the same as the first
choice except keyword was moved over
position and count was also moved over
for the same reason as before namely
that we only have one count for the key
instead of for each URL this isn't the
right solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
