about whether or not it purses like oh I
get more feedback yeah so this this is a
good question about you know for the
quizzes you in lecture you get immediate
feedback and we think that's that's
useful for the homeworks you don't get
any feedback until after the deadline
and this is something we're thinking
about how to provide some feedback on
the homeworks but still to make them
different from the quizzes in lecture so
so you're getting some feedback but not
getting the answer until after the
deadline and until we have something
like that in place though it's important
that I've seen a lot of people they copy
edit in an external editor and then they
pasted it into our programming
environment and it can mess with the
formatting and Python it's one of those
languages where formatting matters it's
a good idea to run the that your code
when you submit the homework to see the
output um I got three questions wrong in
homework 2 for not doing that so it's uh
it's a good idea for everyone so good
it's good the grading policy drops one
homer again yeah but you're gonna need
that one and I think I'll do okay in DC
but we'll see so we have are you
enjoying teaching a okay so Michelle's s
massive online first experiences with
calm it is my first experience in the
MOOC that the largest course I taught
before this one had about 100 students
less than 100 students in it Croesus it
was actually the data structures i undid
a representation of class the intro CS
course that I teach at UVA last semester
ahead 50 students in it it's been that's
typical size it's been the first time I
thought it had nine students so they're
great things teaching small classes
getting to know all the students and
being able to sort of understand at that
level what everyone's doing but it's
really terrific to be able to teach a
class like this and have many many
thousands of students from all around
the world and you know the range of
backgrounds said there was a post in the
forum about the backgrounds that that
several hundred of you posted in its
really interesting for me to see that
and in to see
how diverse the group of students that
we have in the classes it's inspiring
it's inspiring it and it is an
opportunity that I think we're very
humbled by and I'm humbled by to have a
chance to introduce this many people
that took computer science and I hope we
don't lose people but I you know people
are enjoying it and get a lot of
evidence it's really gratifying to me to
see what's happening and see how many
people are contributing in the forums
and other ways to make the class better
so so it is it's a really wonderful and
amazing experience so we have a question
from Graham how did you learn to first
however these how did you build so you
can heal out right haha I guess I'll go
first cuz I learned earlier since appear
without live when I learned to program
so I got started programming um when I
was in elementary school my school got a
teletype computer so this was a computer
where it you know its head paper and it
was printing on it the year after that
we got Apple tools and you had colors
and screens but my first experience was
with this teletype computer that you
called in put a phone on a coupler and
you could log into a computer have to
have a child cd2 there was no trial CD
you just called it and and the cool
thing about computing in those days was
the code was written in a language
called basic and all the programs you
could see what they were so I started
playing these games on the computer I
wanted to do better in the games because
I was you know trying to win the games
and you could type list and see all the
code and it didn't make much sense to me
at first but I started to look at and
try to understand what's going on and
tried to change the code psyche were
cheating I was cheating in the games um
and that got me you know once once we
got Apple tues you could start to do
cool things with colors and big pictures
and it got really fun so that's that's
how I got started in programming I got
started with little Legos they were
these LEGO sets they're called Lego
Mindstorms yep and so basically it's a
bunch of Legos with a couple motors and
hooked up to a little kind of basically
processing unit that also powers the
motors and you just hook it up to a
computer and you can the programming
environment is block-based
just have a little like Lego block that
you do just do the command so it might
be moved forward for 30 seconds things
like a conditional that's like an if
statement and so that's really the first
thing i did programming and I build a
little robot that crawled around on my
floor and when like pick up trash I mean
the couldn't pick up anything that heavy
visited tell whether something was
trasher no no and it would basically
patrol my floor until I threw things on
the ground which was often like I
suppose it's called it I didn't but now
yeah yeah it's called a robot they beat
me to it dang and then from that I guess
that's how I was always interested in
playing with this stuff kind of building
computers and things like that and then
I went to it was like a summer camp in
middle school where we programmed in c
and programming and c is not the funnest
thing yeah program python is a lot more
fun yeah and you would have it so easy
when something breaks it tells you what
happened not Nancy do we have any other
questions
okay we can go get your to quinn from
fitness yes we got many pages of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
