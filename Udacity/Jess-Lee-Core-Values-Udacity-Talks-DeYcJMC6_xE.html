now actually poly bores core values they
define our culture but there's three
things the first is um delight the user
so the only way you can win in a startup
you know with very competitive landscape
is to build something users actually
whine and they can't just you have to
build something that really delights
them that they love they want to tell
their friends about and no matter how
good you how much money you raise how
good your marketing is or your PR like
if you don't have that like you can't
win so that's the number one most
important thing the second core value is
do a few things well I really believe in
focus like you know you don't have
infinite time or resource you have to
pick a few things you want to be
remembered for whether it's your product
or you personally and the third is make
an impact which is really what it means
is hire amazing smart people and empower
them you know it's startup sir it's
really however you know this it's it's
really hard it's a really long journey
there's so many twists and turns like
things go wrong all the time you're
constantly failing and then winning and
failing and failing and then figuring it
out I mean it took us eight years from
the very beginning of Polyvore to you
know a successful outcome and and being
acquired by Yahoo and I think people
don't realize that the average time from
start to exit for a start-up is actually
nine years so yes you have to do
something that you really love and you
have to do it with people that you love
being around because it takes so much
energy and there's so many things that
can go wrong I mean everything goes
wrong along the way and the odds are
just totally against you you know most
startups don't just fail right so you
just you just remember that the journey
is supposed to be long it's supposed to
be hard but enjoy it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
