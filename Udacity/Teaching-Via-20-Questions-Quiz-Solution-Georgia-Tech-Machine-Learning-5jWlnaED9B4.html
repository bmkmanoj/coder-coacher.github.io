think this through so the teacher gets
to suggest to the student any any
question the teacher knows the answer
and the teacher would like the learner
to get the answer as quickly as possible
not requiring the full 20 questions if
possible so what do you think what do
you think the teacher could do as a good
strategy here for 20 questions yeah so
if we think of the set of possible
people as being these sort of hypotheses
and you know which of the hypotheses is
correct and which is wrong then
presuming the teacher can keep all this
in her head I guess the right thing to
do would be to always pick an X such
that it gets rid of as many of the
hypotheses as possible but what do I
mean by that I mean it gives the most
information well but there's a there's a
very strong kind of information that you
could get in this particular case so
let's imagine that the set of questions
is is the sort of you can ask any
question in the universe so I give you
some questions let's let's try this you
cuz remember we did this before you
thought of a person and you had me ask
questions so why don't you think of a
person okay all right and I want you to
tell me what question I should ask
that's going to figure out who the
person is as quickly as possible okay is
this person as good in his field as his
namesake is in his field is it Michael
Jordan yes is it the Michael Jordan
who's a professor at Berkeley yes okay
you could have asked if I say is it
Michael I Jordan yeah I don't think i
know the initials of the two Michael
Jordan's yeah Michael Jordan for people
who don't know is a professor of
Berkeley and one of the Giants and
machine learning and he is quite
literally the Michael Jordan of
machinery all right but but but you
could have done this in one question
right if you had to ask me if the first
question was is the person and then the
actual person you knew that the answer
to that would be yes and so I would have
gotten it in one step that's true so
given a you know a sufficiently helpful
teacher you can you can do this in one
well that makes sense right so basically
if my questions include is this the
correct hypothesis then you should
always just ask that question right but
that seems that seems like cheating
yeah you're right and all I was really
trying to do is show that it's a very
different problem when the the question
has to come from the learners side that
kind of question from the learner side
would be pure folly because it would if
the learner would not know which person
to pick if the person started if the
learner started ask questions like is
the person Michael I Jordan the answer
is very likely to be no in which case
that's not very helpful now a really
helpful teacher could potentially change
the target but that's that's definitely
cheating hmm okay fair enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
