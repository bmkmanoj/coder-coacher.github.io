they are one of my favorite parts of
Python this is really a great way to
program it's very declarative you just
say what you want and the system makes
it for you unfortunately they have a
slight downside which is it thus far
we've had to write out the starter list
and that's almost as much work as just
writing down what we need if only there
were some way to generate this list
especially if it's really big without us
having to write it down explicitly so
for example suppose I started with a big
list like this one two three four five
six seven I assert it's big it's big for
me this is heavy lifting for your
professor and what I want to do is
filter it down so that we only have the
odd numbers so I want to get this part
out I'm going to show you a new way to
do that in Python so here I've written a
procedure called odds only in Python
that takes a list of numbers and it's
going to iterate over them for every n
in that list of numbers if that number
is odd we divide it by two and check the
remainder 5/2 is for with remainder 1 so
it's odd we yield that part into our
result note that I did not write the
word return yield is a new special
keyword that means we can use this sort
of procedure to gather up multiple
results let's imagine that this big list
here was numbers will yield one not do
anything with to yield three not do
anything with four yield five not do
anything with six and yield seven and
that's exactly the output that we wanted
so you can view this as sort of a
convenient way of filtering so here I've
written out our odds only procedure I'm
just going to show you in the
interpreter how this plays out i'm using
a list comprehension i want to print out
every value of x that's in odds only of
one two three four five and we get one
three and five as we expected I'm also
going to show you an even easier way to
do this snap it'll be so cool here I've
written a list comprehension I want X 4
x's in one two three four five but over
here on the right I've put this sort of
if conditional a guard or a predicate we
might call it in mathematics this is
saying I only want you to yield those
numbers for which the predicate is true
only include X in the answer if X was an
odd number and look we get the answer we
wanted I've written X a few times but I
can make these formulas arbitrarily more
complicated here I've said
all of the odd numbers and multiply them
by 2 since 13 and five or the odd
numbers to 6 and 10 or the
multiplication by 2 I love list
comprehensions and you will too soon a
function like odds only that uses yield
to potentially return multiple answers
is called a generator because you can
use it to generate another list or
another enumeration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
