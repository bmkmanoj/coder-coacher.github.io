security let's first talk about why we
need network security in the first place
the Internet is actually subject to a
wide variety of attacks on various parts
of the infrastructure one part of the
infrastructure that can be attacked is
routing so the Internet's routing
protocol the border gateway protocol is
notorious for being susceptible to
different kinds of attacks for example
on April 8th 2010 China advertised about
50,000 blocks of IP addresses from a
hundred and seventy different countries
the event lasted for about 20 minutes in
this particular case the hijack appears
to have been accidental because the
prefixes were long enough such that they
didn't disrupt existing routes but the
fact that the route advertisements were
allowed to leak in the first place
highlights the vulnerability of the
border gateway protocol effectively the
border gateway protocol essentially
allows any a s to advertise and IP
prefix to a neighboring a s and that a s
will typically just believe that route
advertisement and advertise it to the
rest of the Internet these events that
occur where an a s advertises a prefix
that it does not own are called route
hijacks and they tend to occur more
often than one might expect in addition
to the event on April 8th 2010 another
event in 2008 occurred where Pakistan
hijacked the YouTube prefixes
potentially as a botched attempt to
block YouTube in the country following a
government order unfortunately the event
resulted in disruption of connectivity
to YouTube for people all around the
world in January of 2006
con Edison accidentally hijacked a lot
of transit networks including level-3
unit and several other large ISPs
disrupting connectivity to many
customers and on April 25th in 1995 one
of the more famous route hijack
incidents was the as7 0:07 incident
where a s 7007 advertised all of the IP
prefixes on
the entire Internet as originating in
its own a s resulting in disruption of
connectivity to huge fractions of the
internet so we've surveyed some famous
or shall we say notorious attacks on
internet routing but another part of the
infrastructure that's vulnerable is
naming or the DNS one very popular and
effective means of mounting an attack on
the naming system is through something
called reflection DNS reflection is a
way of generating very large amounts of
traffic targeted at a victim in an
attack called a distributed denial of
service or DDoS attack another type of
attack on the naming system is phishing
where by an attacker exploits the domain
name system in an attempt to trick a
user into revealing personal information
such as passwords on a rogue website in
general denial of service attacks are
extremely common and can be mounted in a
variety of different ways DNS reflection
is just one way that distributed denial
of service attacks are mounted we'll
explore some others later on in this
lesson it's worth asking why the
Internet is so vulnerable to different
kinds of attacks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
