introduction to RSA and asymmetric
cryptography it's really a very powerful
idea in this unit we introduced the idea
of using asymmetric cryptography both
for privacy and for signatures there's
lots more that we can do with asymmetric
cryptography and we'll talk about some
of that in the next unit we talked about
the RSA cryptosystem which is probably
still the most widely used public key
cryptosystem and there are billions of
transactions going on every day using
RSA nearly every time use the secure
website it's very likely that RSA is
being used and we'll talk about the
protocol for that next unit and we
argued that RSA was correct that it was
invertible and had all the properties
that we needed to be able to encrypt and
decrypt messages and its correctness
dependent on theorems that go back
thousands of years from euclid more
recent ones but still many hundreds of
years old from euler and fermont and
it's putting those things together in
the right way that led to this solution
that enables most of modern ecommerce we
also argued that RSA is probably secure
at least for the time being and that
depends on the hardness of factoring
then we talked about some issues in
using RSA in practice the dangers of
encrypting small messages or messages
from a small set of known messages and
solutions to that based on using random
padding there's one issue that we
haven't covered yet and that's how does
Bob actually no Alice's public key if
they can get together in a room maybe
she could give it to him but that's not
usually possible so this is a hard
problem and until we have a solution for
that we're going to have to take away
Bob smiley face and he's still a little
bit family until we have a solution to
this problem we don't have a good way to
use asymmetric cryptography in practice
because it relies on be able to get all
these public keys so that's one of the
things we'll talk about next unit how to
build a public key infrastructure so Bob
can learn Alice's public key as well as
lots more interesting applications of
asymmetric cryptography hope to see you
back for unit 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
