information on it now let's make it
yours if you're designing a website just
for fun or for a specific business
purpose the feeling you want to portray
can differ widely much like your
personal fashion choices the style you
apply to your map can say a lot about
the feeling of your company or site it
can also help direct the users attention
to the things that you want to stand out
it can reflect the classiness of
business or site that you're creating or
it can simply be a matter of personal
taste in any case you'll want to make it
your own by applying styling Google Maps
come with a standard style that most
people are very familiar with the things
that we're able to change about it or
called features and they include things
like water land features roads such as
highways and local roads points of
interest and all the labels associated
with them let's check out a few examples
of styled Maps first here's a simple
example we've changed the water to read
and set the cue of the whole map to the
same color we've also turned off all the
labels here's a pretty cool gray scale
map this could be great if you want to
draw attention to only a few color
details like markers this is a good
example of a functionally styled map the
user only sees the road elements these
samples are all from snazzy Maps an
awesome sight for pre-built styles it's
linked in the instructor notes whatever
you want to do you can do it let's make
our own custom style will create a
Styles array in our initialize function
styled maps use two concepts to apply
colors and changes to a map map features
are the geographic elements that can be
targeted on the map roads parks bodies
of water etc elements are what about
that feature that you want to change the
geometry itself the label the label
outliner text stylers are the color and
visibility properties that can be
applied to the map features map features
and stylers are combined into the Styles
array styles are cascading so for
example if you make all the roads red
and then choose
to make highways blue you'll get blue
highways and red local and arterial
roads also unless you choose a style the
map will stick with the defaults we can
craft styles from scratch but there's
also a ton of great and free options
online that give you starters and from
there you can change the colors add and
remove stuff make it your own just
Google search for Google Maps API styles
I'm using a set of styles here I found
online but I've made the transit station
stand out more at the same time will set
the Styles property within the map
object options now in addition to a zoom
in a center the map object gets a set of
styles which we've defined above it the
map type controls parameter allows the
user to change the map type to road
terrain satellite etc so we're disabling
that by setting it to false while we're
being fancy will jazz up the markers a
bit to match our map I'm creating two
new marker icons here one is the default
icon which will appear when the markers
appear on the map and one that's a
highlighted icon which will appear when
I hover over a marker I've created a
simple function below to take in a color
and create a marker icon object this
make marker icon function simply takes
in a marker color and creates a new
marker image using that marker color and
using some custom sizes and whatnot then
I'm going to go back to our loop where
we create all of our markers and set the
icon on each marker to default icon
finally I'm going to add to event
listeners one for a mouse-over event to
change our icon to the highlighted icon
and one for the mouse out event to
change it back to the default icon this
is going to make the marker yellow when
I mouse over it and then turn it back to
blue when I mouse out of it I only have
a few markers so this may not be totally
necessary but if I had hundreds this
would definitely help the user select
the correct icon wow that's a pretty
funky-looking map I hope you guys like
neon as much as I do before you try it
out yourself let's talk about one more
cool feature of styling custom map types
this sample lets the user toggle between
different styles
for a real estate app we could enable
map types for example they can let the
user decide to make subways and transit
stops and out focus on neighborhood
boundaries or highlight parks and other
points of interests click on the link in
the instructor notes to see this sample
next tryout creating your own styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
