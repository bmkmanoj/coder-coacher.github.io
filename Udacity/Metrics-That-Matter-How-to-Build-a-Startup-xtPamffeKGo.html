costs is that in the old days costs and
revenue the minute you started your
company your investor said oh we know
how to track all this we want you to
fill out an income statement a balance
sheet and cash flow and we want you to
do accounting from day one which gives
us visibility and forecast etc the
problem is is these were execution
metrics existing companies execute known
clients you could in fact do all the
spreadsheets you one for every board
meeting but in fact they're not worth
the paper they're printed on but you and
your maybe rent the CFO or accountant
have spent a lot of time now understand
that your VCS or investors if they're
professionals need them for their
investors but what you really need to be
doing is working with your investors and
your management team is to derive the
metrics that matter so if your investors
really want to see income statement
balance sheet class well great you could
give them the fantasy documents all they
want but what you're really interested
in is trying to understand what are the
metrics that matter for your business
and I'll give you some examples in value
proposition what was the product cost
what was the market size
what share could you take what's the
competition what are they charging and
customer relationships all the get keep
grow metrics some of which we talked
about some which will discover what were
the customer acquisition costs or were
the conversion rates all with a lifetime
value these are key metrics this is a
lot more important than what's revenue
in year four because you're just
guessing about that but these are
numbers you're going to be living with
every day and by the way when Marga type
are you in if you remember from our
earlier lectures if you're an existing
market that's a different type of
revenue curve than being in a new market
do your investors still agree what are
your operating costs what are the basic
fixed and variable cost of the business
what's the cost of your channel what's
the margin the channel needs how much
are you gonna have to spend on channel
promotion shelf space any other channel
extra charges and then again for your
revenue stream do you now know with
certainty the
average selling price the number of
customers per year achievable revenue
how long it takes to close a sale and
here's the number that actually
intersects with one of the ones that
your investors are worrying about all
the time how much money are you spending
per month often called burn rate and not
only are you how much are you burning
per month but when we just calculate
that out when will you run out of money
all these numbers are ones that you as
founders need to have on the top of your
head no startup has three hundred
numbers there's probably somewhere
between five and fifteen that matter and
maybe you could be the exception but you
as the founder need to know all these
parameters and in fact the exercises see
if you could go up to a whiteboard and
list them and if you can't understand
that that's your job in searching for
the business model and when you know
these numbers the spreadsheets fall out
of these but trying to do it ab initio
from some guessing spreadsheet just as
some fantasy you need to get these
metrics that matter known searched
understood and don't worry they will
change but the whole game of the
business model canvas and the customer
development process was for you to find
them out firsthand and to experience
them not to have them happen to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
