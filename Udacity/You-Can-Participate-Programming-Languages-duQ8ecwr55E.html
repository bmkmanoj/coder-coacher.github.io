forums a number of you have asked me
about research or what I do to nominally
push forth the boundaries of human
knowledge and make the world a better
place and now I'd like to give you the
chance the opportunity to participate in
just such a project Oh fellow travelers
on this voyage of discovery I stand
before you hat in hand well
metaphorically at any rate asking for
your help for your participation they
set the stage for you imagine that you
have a job as a computer scientist and
you have a program that you'd like to
work on it could be some excel macros to
make a better spreadsheet it could be a
game you've always wanted it could be an
assignment from your superior probably
you will think hard about the problem
well that's what we hope everyone does
find examples online write your code
debug it and then typically later you
may have to make some changes all of
these stages except perhaps thinking
about the problem involve reading code
it turns out that an industrial practice
more time is spent reading code than on
any other activity especially writing it
by some estimates up to seventy percent
of time is spent just reading existing
code and as a result the readability of
code has a huge impact on productivity
readable code doesn't just look good it
has an economic impact that makes it
unfortunate that we really do not
understand code readability at all we
have some intuitions for natural
language readability when something is
at the third grade level versus the
seventh grade level but we'd really like
to understand code readability more I
think that one way to do that is to ask
people like you ask people in the real
world what do you think is this code
readable or not and from that build a
formal mechanical model that we can use
to evaluate existing pieces of code and
make representations the largest
existing study on code readability more
than seventy percent of the work of
industrial software development involves
only 100 participants I think that we
free online education
can do better and I'm going to need your
help the survey we'd like you to
participate in consists of a number of
examples of snippets of code from
real-world programs the survey is
completely voluntary and anonymous we're
not going to store any identifying
information instead will present you
with a number of snippets of real-world
programs written in either Python Java
or CUDA you are ready familiar with
Python but you may be less familiar with
java or cuda a language for programming
graphics cards you don't need to be an
expert you don't need to be familiar
with those languages in fact you don't
even need to have heard of those
languages we're very interested in
gathering your intuitive notions of
software readability so we'll show you a
number of pieces of code and after
looking over each snippet you'll rate it
on a scale of one to five where one
indicates less readable and five
indicates more readable the exact notion
of readability we are leaving up to you
for example perhaps you'll see a snippet
like this and decide that it's a little
less readable perhaps you'll see a
snippet like this and decide that it's a
little more readable we're really
interested in what you think about this
subject so the survey takes about 15 to
30 minutes and it's totally anonymous
and confidential we're not going to
store any important information that
would help us trace these numbers back
to you it's not related to this Udacity
class in any way in fact it's not worth
extra credit it doesn't influence your
grade it's solely to try to make the
world a better place by increasing human
knowledge by helping us to understand
when code is readable and when code
isn't a really important part of
software development I realized that
many of you are quite busy you've got
other things to do not a problem at all
but if you are interested if you're not
busy if you have a few moments to spare
I would really personally appreciate it
if you would take them and help us out
even if you're not particularly
comfortable or an expert with these
languages who are just as necessary
those data points are critical so if
this isn't worth extra credit why should
you participate well a number of people
the forums have suggested that based on
my reasonable radio announcer voice I
should consider singing a bit more these
people are clearly doing their best to
flatter me because my singing is not all
that in a bag of chips but the graduate
student who is leading this project
who's helping me out is a pretty good
singer so what we have agreed to do or
what I would be happy to do is if we're
able to get the required number of
participants if a thousand people help
us out we will happily sing the song of
your choice we have no shame if it will
help us push forth the boundaries of
human knowledge so if you like Irish
music oh it is the biggest mixed up that
you have ever seen holy mummy father
loves nikita khrushchev holy moly me if
you like bollywood musicals pretty woman
dekho dekho na if you like it on from
Sakura float avec moi jaffe n'importe
quoi if you prefer it in Spanish and
keep it okay best son though if you like
Japanese daiya daiya tossed about kasuba
chotto Edo nadejda make a will he totes
ooh or if you just like more English or
American folk music lemon tree very
pretty will do anything you want whether
it be the theme to The Muppet Show or
whether you'd like to hear me butcher
romantic mandarin songs run fun thing I
sheung shui we will do it start a thread
in the forum and vote for your favorite
participate in the survey and I will
happily do almost anything in order to
make the world a better place with
future research police participate if
you do have a few minutes but it is by
no means required thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
