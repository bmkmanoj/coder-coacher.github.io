five-thirds and positive one third great
work if you found these two a new
fractions aren't always the easiest to
work with but let's see how we got these
two answers first will let u equal x
plus 1 this will allow us to perform the
U substitution in this step so we'll
have 9 u squared minus 6 u minus 8
equals 0 now that we have a quadratic
expression we want to find factors of
negative 72 the a times the see that sum
to negative 6 RB value those factors are
negative 12 and positive 6 so I use
these two to rewrite the middle term
here we use factoring by grouping to get
3 u plus 2 times 3 u minus 4 equals to 0
we set each of these factors equal to 0
so we'll have you can equal negative
two-thirds or you can equal positive 4
thirds now if you got this far and
solved for these values of you great
work keep in mind though we need to
solve for the values of x the original
variable from our equation we use our
two solutions for you and the fact that
you equals x plus one to solve for the
original variable X so we'll have X plus
one equals negative two-thirds and we'll
have X plus one equals the Four Thirds
we subtract one from each side of the
two equations to get these statements
here we have X equal to negative
two-thirds minus one so since i have
negative two thirds and negative one i
have negative one and two thirds this is
the mixed number if i change it to an
improper fraction I'd have negative
five-thirds for the other value of x
will have x equals four thirds minus one
when i subtract one i get to choose what
this one looks like since i have thirds
over here i want to make sure that i
subtract three thirds a form of one over
here four thirds minus three thirds
equals one-third and here are two
solutions negative five-thirds and
one-third</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
