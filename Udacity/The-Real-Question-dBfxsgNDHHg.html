you might ask what does this have to do
with vision what does this have to do
with vision well you might have some
video of something happening such as a
person moving their hands around to wave
or point or control something and you'd
like to be able to say you know which
gesture is this or well you know what
action are they doing and the stuff I'm
talk about today is sort of some of this
time series work in particular Markov
models apply to the decoding of visual
kinds of information so the real
question is how do we model these
problems how do we you know how are we
going to build I showed you these time
series well we need a model of these and
in particular we're going to have to
given a bunch of them be able to
construct that model so it's basically
going to be an inference or a learning
problem the learning is learning the
model and the inference is well given a
set of models which one do I think is
most likely to have generated the data
that I'm seeing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
