live I want to make sure it's within a
reasonable distance of my office
obviously I don't want to travel 50
miles every day to work especially in
the Big Apple a few miles can quickly
turn into a few hours maybe it's also
important to me that I can get to work
via public transportation within our
site we want to give users the option to
enter their work location daycare mom's
house or other important places and only
show real estate listings within a
certain distance of those places how can
we do this we'll use a magical service
called the distance matrix API Google's
distance matrix service computes travel
distance and journey duration between
multiple origins and destinations given
a mode of travel once again we'll use an
HTTP request to talk about the input and
output for the distance matrix API the
request has the same format as the
geocoding request will specify the
service and the output format which can
be either JSON or XML then we'll define
the input parameters for the distance
matrix API the only required parameters
are the key and at least one origin and
destination pair here I'm calculating
the distance and duration of travel
between New York New York and San
Francisco California let's take a look
at the output again we see the status
and then we see the distance and
duration of the journey we can see here
that we only have one element an element
is an origin and destination pair since
we only have one origin and one
destination we only have one element if
we specified let's say two origins and
two destinations we'd have four elements
with the distance and duration between
each origin and each destination since
we didn't specify any travel mode in
this request it defaults to driving it's
telling me that it's a 4676 kilometer
drive which will take me one day in 18
hours note that the distance value
defaults to meters and the duration
value defaults to seconds
add in some optional parameters I'm
adding in a mode here we can use driving
walking bicycling or transit let's see
how long it would take me to bike there
also I probably want to avoid biking on
the freeway so I'll include the avoid
parameter until it to avoid highways
specifying bicycling sugar to do that
though as it favors bike paths or
preferred streets alright it would take
me over 11 days to bike from New York
City to San Francisco actually it would
probably take me several weeks and I
might not make it we're Googlers and we
love biking and all that but uh that's a
long way for me to go to visit oj
probably more realistic would be for me
to take transit for transit I can even
specify transit modes such as rail bus
subway etc let's avoid long bus rides
and specify rail okay so three days
that's not that bad I think I'll stick
to flying though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
