let's move on to simple operations will
start with comparison operators let's
say my little cousin Chloe gets an
allowance every week with her allowance
she likes to get ice cream and go to the
movies by the way I'm gonna use a lot of
if statements in these operations for
now just become accustomed to how the if
statements look and stay tuned for more
practice writing if statements in the
lesson on control flow if she gets soft
sir for a dollar fifty everything is all
good she can get ice cream and go to the
movies but if Chloe goes to the fancy
ice cream place the calculation changes
if we wanted to condition on the case
that she has just enough allowance we
could use the equals operator but of
course it makes more sense to condition
on her having greater than or equal to
the combined price now let's look at the
logical operators here I've defined some
variables as Bulls and allowed the
compiler to infer their type
when conditioning on a bull you just
type the variable name in more verbose
languages you might have to type
something like equals true but that's
not necessary in Swift so here if hungry
is true let's see otherwise we can wait
until later if we want to reverse the
condition we just throw in an
exclamation point indicating not before
hungry here you can see the and operator
if hungry is true and vegetarian is
false
let's eat steak I must admit I have a
hard time passing up a juicy ribeye but
if hungry is true and vegetarian is also
true let's go for pumpkin curry if
neither is true than never mind now
there are a few cases in which hunger is
not a necessary condition for eating and
for me that would be when there is pie
here you can see the or operator so here
if hungry is true or there as pie is
true let's eat now I'm sure comparison
operators and logical operators are a
piece of cake for most of you the
ternary conditional operator is a little
less intuitive but it can be super
convenient once you get the hang of it
Apple summarizes ternary can
nicely in the book Swift programming
language using this theoretical example
here if question is true then the result
is answer one otherwise the result is
answer two so the previous examples
could be written as follows if hungry is
true let's eat otherwise let's wait if
hungry is true or there is pie let's eat
otherwise let's wait as you can imagine
this syntax is really convenient with
short simple conditions but can become
hard to read as your conditions become
longer or more complex this syntax is
especially handy for calculations with
conditions like this one there is one
thing that a ternary operator can do
that an if-else statement cannot the
entire ternary statement is an
expression it evaluates to a single
value so we can insinuate it right into
another expression like this so the
lunch price is now calculated using the
sandwich price and if tax is true we'll
add an additional 50 Cent's otherwise
we'll add nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
