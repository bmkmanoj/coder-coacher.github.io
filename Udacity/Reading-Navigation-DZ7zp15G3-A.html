couple different ways you can navigate
first there's the topic list that we've
been using on the left second you can
filter by folders at the top for example
here are all of the topics in the
project folder the numbers indicate the
number of updated posts in each folder
clicking a folder shows only those
topics in that folder third you can use
the search bar the search bar allows you
to search by keywords or by certain
flags after you start typing a search
query click the search tips to bring up
a lists of flags for example you can
search within titles or for specific
contributors by name note that sometimes
the folder listing across the top won't
list every folder in those cases you can
search by folder here my favorite
navigation features though are found
under this gear right here this menu
lets you view only certain types of
messages for example you can view only
newly created topics by clicking on
unread or you can view only updated
topics by clicking on updated you can
choose to view only instructor posts by
clicking on instructor posts near the
bottom which is a great way to focus on
getting the crucial content pretty fast
you'll also notice that we've been using
compact mode which shows only the topic
titles you can change that at the bottom
if you're overwhelmed by the amount of
new content on Piazza and you just want
to start fresh you can just click mark
all red at the bottom lastly you can
also shortcut these filters
evany has unread updated unresolved and
following shortcutted right here you can
remove a shortcut by clicking remove
shortcut while viewing that filter and
you can add a shortcut by clicking add
shortcut while viewing that filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
