developments about this class is this
whole customer development process it
says you start with your business model
canvas hypotheses and in fact what you
really do is you blow up at the canvas
and you actually post it to the wall and
you use yellow stickies no pens or
pencils allowed because you are going to
get most of them wrong but you're going
to make it visible and you will actually
begin to construct your hypotheses and
the next thing you'll do is look at them
and go hey there aren't any facts in
this room let's get out into the
building and talk to customers and
partners and vendors and we'll learn how
to do this with some rigor with a
process not just randomly getting out
but actually design experiments run
tests get data and more importantly get
some insight and the customer
development process is kind of
interesting the customer development
process is actually a 4-step process the
first step is customer discovery this is
where you construct your hypotheses and
you get out of the building and start
testing your assumption about whether
other people have the same problem or
need you think they have and then you're
going to do customer validation and
actually see if your proposed solution
actually matches what you think the
customer problem was that this test of
between problem and solution and your
features and customers is actually
sometimes called product market fit
that's what you're out testing and this
is what we call the search for the
business model but now instead of
randomly doing this by hiring and firing
sales execs and trying to make numbers
that really are just random guesses
we're actually going to have you get out
as early as possible and test some of
these primary assumptions one of the
interesting things on the bottom of this
diagram that we'll talk about is
something called the pivot and the pivot
is what will save your job once you find
this repeatable and scalable business
model then you go into the execution
phase of customer development and that's
about creating end-user demand and scale
called customer creation and then
building the organizations to actually
build your company for scale by
transitioning from customer development
into
functional organization that's oriented
for constant and rapid execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
