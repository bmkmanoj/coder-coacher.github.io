there's so much intuition built in here
and there's a few reasons why i love
this equation first it says that
acceleration is just your normal
acceleration due to gravity times some
multiplier and then we can think about
well what is this multiplier well this
multiplier depends on the difference of
the two masses if these masses are
identical well subtracting them will
give you zero and you'll have no motion
acceleration will be zero exactly like
we expected if m2 is bigger than m1 well
this will be positive in the denominator
that means we'll have positive
acceleration which we defined as
clockwise exactly what we expected 1 M 2
is greater than and one likewise if m 1
is greater than M 2 it'll be negative
which becomes counterclockwise and
finally in the case where let's say m2
is much much much bigger than m1 let's
say m2 was a thousand kilograms and m1
was one a thousand minus one might as
well just call it a thousand and ignore
the one likewise a thousand plus one who
cares about the one ignore it we have
the acceleration is just equal to g
times m 2 over m to that cancels our
acceleration is equal to g 10 meters per
second squared I love that problem I
hope you liked it as much as I do
there's going to be a lot more learning
to do on the problem set you are not
done here I promise but I think what
you've done today is really amazing good
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
