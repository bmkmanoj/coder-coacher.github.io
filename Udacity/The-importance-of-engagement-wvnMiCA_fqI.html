make money is to make a game fun build a
game that everyone wants to play and pay
money for of course that's easier said
than done and this is why learning about
engagement is important game engagement
is all about how to design your game to
have that addictive quality that keeps
players wanting more it's really
important for monetization because the
more your game is played and your users
drawn into your game world the more
money your game will make take candy
crush as an example when I play I'll
play whenever I have a moment to myself
like when I'm on the bus or just trying
to seem busy on my phone and I'll try to
get to the next level it's really simple
to play and there are always more levels
for me to get to just look at this level
map I have so far to go I feel like I
have to keep playing and these levels
are part of what candy crush is such an
addicting game I even got my mom hooked
and now she's a lot better at it than me
so levels like in candy crush are great
ways to keep players coming back wanting
to go further in the game but they
aren't the only way let's look at what
makes a game engaging in this lesson
we'll talk about how to get the right
level of difficulty in your game adding
competition in your games making your
game easy to access and play across
multiple devices and also turning your
players into fans these are the four
components that we've seen all engaging
games include</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
