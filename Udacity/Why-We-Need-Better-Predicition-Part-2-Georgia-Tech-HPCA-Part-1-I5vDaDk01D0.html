a better predictor in two ways this was
one way the CPI gets a lot better the
other way will be to see how much ways
there is from Amy's prediction so in a
five stage pipeline what's happening
really we have three stages that
irrelevant the one where is resolved the
branches and then we have to destroy two
instructions that we have fetched if
this branch has been miss predicted so a
misprediction costs us two instructions
here in a deeper pipeline what happens
is we have a branch and for ten cycles
we have been fetching things so miss
prediction now costs us ten instructions
worth of work and that means that
avoiding mis-predictions becomes more
important and finally when we have a
four instruction per cycle processor
that resolves branches in the eleventh
stage after we have fetched this branch
we have fetched a lot of instructions
after we fetch the branch we fetched
four instructions in the next cycle and
four instructions in the next cycle so
now when we mispredicted branch we waste
forty instructions that we could have
done if the prediction was correct so
the cost of a misprediction is much
higher in terms of instructions that we
have just wasted and that means that
again it's much more important to
predict branches correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
