these five strings are in the language
of this grammar the first one looks
pretty good I just apply rule 1 P goes
to open p clothes and then rule 2 to get
rid of the P and I'm in like Flynn how
about this well I'm going to apply rule
one twice so I'll end up with open open
p close close and then I'll use rule two
to get rid of the P similarly over here
i'm going to apply rule 13 times open
open open be close close close and then
i'll apply rule two to get rid of the p
totally in the language of our grammar
but this this is going to be problematic
just an open parenthesis well if you
look over here there's actually no way
to make just a lonely open parenthesis
that does not have a matching closed
parenthesis there's only one rule that
introduces the open parenthesis and it
makes just as many closed parenthesis at
the same time this cannot happen here
this looks good these parentheses match
open close open close but if you take a
look at this grammar there's never a way
to have any open after a close I can
apply this rule as many times as I want
in this pattern but I'm never going to
end up making something like this not as
written we could write a grammar for
this but not currently shown this sort
of system is known as balanced
parentheses the parentheses are balanced
because the number on the left equals
the number on the right one two one two
two two three two three in fact you
could imagine some sort of scale they'd
have to be exactly equal two openings
two closings balanced parentheses this
is a super important problem in computer
science more on that in just a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
