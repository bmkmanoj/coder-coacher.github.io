Archimedes for both spending a lot of
time thinking about the earth and in
fact the Earth's circumference
Eratosthenes it seems had an advantage
so because he was so well-traveled
Eratosthenes knew that here in CNA the
sun's rays struck vertically on the
summer solstice which happens on about
June twenty-first or the 22nd he knew
this because these these rays of the Sun
actually made it all the way to the
bottom of the well which wouldn't happen
if they were coming in at some other
angle he also knew that in a city a
little bit north of CNA called
Alexandria the sun's rays did not strike
exactly vertically he knew this because
he could hold a metal bar or any other
straight object vertically so that it
pointed directly into the ground at
Alexandria and if the Sun were overhead
this shouldn't cast any shadow but it
did turned out this actually made a
small shadow okay so now we're getting
somewhere it looks like to solve this
problem we're going to need to really
explore the geometry involved and since
we use geometry all the time in physics
now's a good time to learn or if you
already know review some of the basics
so let's back up a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
