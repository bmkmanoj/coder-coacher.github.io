if you figured those out for our first
problem we want to combine the roots of
5 so we'll have two square roots of 5
minus 5 square roots of 5 when we
subtract 2-5 we'll get negative three
roots of 5 for the roots of 11 we'll
have four root 11-1 route 11 keep in
mind that there's a one in front of this
square root of 11 so when we subtract
4-1 will get positive three times root
11 this second one is really tricky you
want to pay attention to the index of
the radicals and the radicands here the
index is a two but here the index is the
three this means that these two radicals
are not like terms we have a square root
of two and a cube root of two this means
that we can't add the two terms together
which means we just list them as a sum
it might have been easy to make the
mistake of writing 10 root 2 or 10 times
the cube root of two but again the
indexes are not the same so these would
not be correct for our third one we want
to combine the fifth roots of x the
indexes are 5 i'll match and the
radicands rlx so we have like terms so i
have 3 plus 5 plus 1 times the fifth
root of x this would make nine times the
fifth root of x and our answer this
positive 3 is not like terms with
anything else so we just carry it on and
add it to the sum and our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
