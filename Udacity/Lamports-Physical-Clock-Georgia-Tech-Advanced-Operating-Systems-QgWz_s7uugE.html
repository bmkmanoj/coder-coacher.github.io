clock and the notation we're going to
use for that is this funny symbol here
so this is saying that in physical time
in real time event a in the distributed
system happened before B so if I want to
make sure that that an event a in the
distributed system anywhere happened an
absolute real time before B so P I is a
process PJ event a is happening on P I
and even B is happening on PJ and what
we want to make sure is that the
timestamp associated with a has to be
less than the timestamp associated as B
if I want to guarantee that a in real
time happened before B so a and real
time happened before B that is how you
have to read this notation that in real
time the event a happened before B and
in order to satisfy that the condition
is the timestamp associated with a has
to be less than a timestamp associated
with B so regarding T this and we are
talking about real time here so the real
timestamp associated with a and B in
order to ensure that the real time
associated with these events give you
this guarantee you have to have certain
conditions associated with the clocks
that are on the machines P I and PG and
the first condition which I'll call pc-1
as refer to that as PC one later on the
condition is a bound on individual clock
drift so PC one is a condition which
gives a bound on individual clock drift
informally what this condition is going
to tell you is that the clocks don't
drift that much so let's talk about this
if what is the time that is read on
process P I at time T if T is the real
time at time T real time T I look at the
clock on my machine and that is CI of T
what should it read well it should read
T now if it doesn't that's when we are
saying it is drifting with respect to T
and so what this equation is saying is d
CI or DT is the clock drift the absolute
value of the drift is
very very small so in other words what
we are saying is all the clocks in the
distributed system whether we are
talking about CI on PII or CJ on PII all
these clocks are running approximately
correctly so that the clock individual
drift is very very small so K is the
individual clock drift and we are hoping
that it is very very small and you can
see that if CI of T is equal to T then
DCI of DT should be equal to 1 and
therefore this be a zero so the
left-hand side of this will be a zero
and so that's why we are saying that K
has to be a very small number
the second condition is that the mutual
drift between the clocks on different
nodes of the distributed system should
be very small there should be a bound on
mutual clock drift so that is captured
in this condition saying that for all IJ
any pair of nodes in the entire
distributed system the difference
between the time that I read on my clock
and the time that I read on somebody
else's clock is very very small so this
is the mutual clock drift as I said
earlier at real time T my clock should
also be reading T this guy also should
be reading T if it doesn't that's when
you have a drift what we are saying is
the mutual clock drift between any two
nodes in the entire distributed system
is bound by a small quantity epsilon so
K and epsilon are the two important
parameters in the physical clock
condition intuitively we're going to
argue that these values the absolute
values of these individual clock drift
and mutual clock drift has to be
negligible compared to the inter process
communication time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
