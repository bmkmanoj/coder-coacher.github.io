these values you can see that the values
go all the way to 101 since there's not
a value in cell a1 there are 100 values
so here we'll write equals average a2
through a 101 that gives us the average
now here we type a2 minus whatever we
got for the average which is our
deviation so equals a2 minus 50 thousand
five hundred eighty six point three six
I usually like to round it to two
decimal places make sure that you don't
put in any commas now we drag this down
all the way to Selby 101 and now we have
each deviation from the mean so remember
this is X I minus X bar now we're going
to square each deviation equals b2
squared and again we're going to drag
this all the way down now we can find
the average of the squared deviations
which is the variance so we write equals
average c2 colon C 101 so now we have
the variance and finally we take the
square root of the variance to find the
standard deviation equals s QR t of cell
f1 and you always know if you're using
the right cell if there's a dotted line
highlighting it so here it is you should
have gotten approximately 10,000 657 for
your standard deviation due to rounding
there is a range for answers that were
correct in this quiz good job this is
really tough stuff and actually this is
probably one of the most complicated
calculations that you'll have to do
throughout the rest of the
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
