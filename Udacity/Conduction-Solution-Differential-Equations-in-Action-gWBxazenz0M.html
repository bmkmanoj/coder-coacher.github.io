problem with heat along the wire first
things first I've rewritten the implicit
equation that I gave you in the intro
video the only change here that you'll
see is that I replaced the coefficient
in front of the parentheses with see the
parameter that we created for you in the
code now if we rearrange this equation a
little bit we can get it in a form
that's super convenient for using numpy
metallic solve this is because we
already know t8 at time zero and now we
know what the coefficients are so we
want to solve for all the temperatures
after time step of age this shows us
then that two of the elements in the
matrix coefficients are going to be
negative C + 1 + to see the one
exception to this is going to occur at
the boundaries I told you these we're
going to be a little bit tricky so let's
talk about how to deal with them right
now if we take this equation right here
but instead plug in the correct values
for T 0 we see something interesting
there's a dependence on T negative 1 now
we defined our boundary conditions
earlier that t- one was going to equal
to zero for any time once we plug this
in we're actually going to get a pretty
simple equation something that only
depends on t0 and t1 to help you better
visualize how we're going to fill in the
array using loops and created this
diagram right here which color codes the
different possible coefficients that we
could have in any slot in the matrix as
you just saw a bunch of the terms in the
matrix are going to be 0 so I filled in
big zeros for those portions of the
matrix we know that the temperature of
the segment that we're looking at is
going to have a coefficient of 1 plus to
see in front of it corresponding to
these blue spirals we know that both
adjacent segments will have coefficients
of minus C which is this pink spirals
over here the two exceptions of course
occur at the boundaries or we have one
pink spiral and one green spiral for one
coefficient of negative C and then one
coefficient of 1 plus C now if I felt
like working really hard I guess I could
have drawn this diagram with 100 rows
and 100 columns making it the actual
size of the matrix that we're looking at
but I was feeling lazy so i scaled it
down a bit however if we think about it
we know that the number of blue spirals
in that imaginary expanded diagram would
be equal to 98 because there's going to
you one blue spiral in every row with
the exception of the first and last
similarly we would see 198 pink spirals
to for every row except only one in the
top and bottom rows in the picture I
just showed you the blue spirals
correspond to the coefficient 1 plus 2c
and we said that we would need a loop
using 98 innovations to express that as
exactly what we have here in this top
four loop we can see that the next four
loop contains one more iteration since
it starts that index one lower as
expected this corresponds to the pink
spiral in the diagram where the
coefficient equals negative see here we
have the two exceptions for the two
different boundaries and you remember
that these were the green spirals in the
diagram we can check and see that we've
set the step size equal to 0 point five
seconds as we said that we wanted to we
can run the program and see what we get
sure enough we end up with the same
solution that I showed you earlier since
in our initial situation we had a flame
placed under the center of our wire it
makes sense that after some time has
passed we still see a peak in
temperature toward the center of the
wire but that the distribution has
smoothed out quite a bit this falls
right in line with what we expect from
the heat equation right now the end time
is set to 10 seconds which means that
the final graph that we're looking at is
the distribution of the temperature at
this time let's see what happens if we
set it to something smaller showing
what's happening earlier on in the
temperature change so here's our
distribution after just four seconds
have passed you can see that we have a
nice smooth curve a lot like what we saw
earlier except that this time the peak
is at a much higher level than it was
earlier when n time was set to 10
seconds the peak was just under 500
Kelvin and now we can see that it's
resting right above 600 the distribution
is also quite a bit narrower showing
that we're further away from an
equilibrium position than we were with
the larger step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
