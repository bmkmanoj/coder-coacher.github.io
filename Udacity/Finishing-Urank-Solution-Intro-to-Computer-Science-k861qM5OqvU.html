go through all the pages in the graph so
we'll call them nodes this time we can't
use page again because we already use
page up here so we're gonna go through
each page in the graph giving it the
name node and for each node now what we
need to do is check whether that page
links to this one so we're going to look
in graph index node that's going to get
us the list of all the pages that node
links to if page is in that list well
that means that node links to page so
that means that we should add two new
ranked based on the rank of this node so
that's what we're gonna do we're gonna
add two new rank and the new value is
going to be the old value we're summing
into the value of new rank we're going
to multiply by D that's our damping
factor and the value that we're going to
use here is the page rank of the node
remember it's the node that links to
this node that we care about so we're
getting the rank of the page what we
want to do is divide that by the number
of out links from that page and that's
important that means that each page with
many links the value of each link is
less we need to divide that by the
length of that list which is what we get
by looking at graph index node so that's
all we need we're gonna update the new
rank we're going through all the nodes
in the graph we're finding all the nodes
that link to this one and we're updating
our rank using the formula to get that
and at the end we're returning the ranks
so let's try that in the Python
interpreter we have the code that we
just wrote for compute ranks we're gonna
use crawl web passing in the example
site assigning the outputs to the
variable index which is the index and
graph and then we're passing in graph to
compute ranks storing the result in the
variable ranks and we can print out the
result in ranks to see the page ranks so
here's what we get so we get a
dictionary for each URL that we crawled
we have an entry where we have the URL
followed by each page ranked as the
value so let's see if the ranks that we
get makes sense so going back to our
example site we have the page
clean that has two links going into it
we have the page nickel that has three
light links going into it if we just did
simple link counting well then nickel
should be more popular than Kathleen if
we look at the page ranks well the page
rank for nickel is zero point nine seven
the page rank for Kathleen is zero point
one one so the page rank is actually
higher for the page that only has two
incoming links and the reason for that
is well even though it only has two
incoming links the links that are coming
into the page are from popular pages
it's coming in from the index page and
it's coming in from the very popular
nickel page so that's why the PageRank
of Kathleen is actually higher than the
page rank of nel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
