pattern to add cards for movies from a
database cards can be created to display
any type of data you want after all
they're just views for example to
display a movie card you could create a
view with an image view for artwork and
a text view for the title here will
actually use an image card view which is
provided by the Leanback library first
let's take a quick look at what our
movies database looks like I'm back
inside the load rose method now and I'm
going to uncomment the line that loads
are dummy database by the way our
dummy's database is actually going to
pull images over the web so you'll need
an internet connection from here on out
let's check out the movie class
basically a movie is a simple container
class with a title and a description and
a couple of images that we'll get to
later the setup movies method creates 5
movies with this data now we'll create
cards to display these back inside the
load rose method I'm going to undo the
comments that I did earlier and by the
way the UI that we're going to create
will contain rows of five videos
organized randomly and repeated first
will create a presenter that we can use
to create views for our movies let's
take a look inside this class scrolling
down a bit as before there are two
methods we care about on create view
holder and on buying view holder this
time instead of a text view on create
view holder creates a view using an
image card view this is a class provided
by lean back and it's a card with a
picture and some text whereas previously
we passed a string to our presenter here
we pass a movie object we cast the
parameter to the appropriate type and
this time we set multiple fields on the
view in this loop we create a rows of
cards in a real lab these would be
organized in some sensible way here we
just randomly create rows of five cards
and assign them a category named as
before we need to create an object
adapter that will hold the presenter
that's used to create views for movies
as well as the movies themselves here's
where we add movies from our database to
it and now we create the header item
that will be used for the category name
then we wrap the header and our list of
five movies into a list row and we add
that list road to the object adapter we
previously created that has our list
representer run your project at this
point and see what you get now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
