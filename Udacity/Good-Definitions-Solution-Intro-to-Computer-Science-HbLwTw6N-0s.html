the key reason why it does not is
there's no base case without a base case
it's not a recursive definition what it
is is a circular definition and that
means that it doesn't actually give us
any answers because we'll never finish
here right the only way that we've
defined popularity whether you look at
that mathematical expression or the
Python code always involves calling
popularity again and we're never going
to get to a point where we can stop that
we're going to keep calling popularity
for different people if we think of
doing this for our friend graph well
here's what would happen so if we want
to know the popularity of Charlie well
we have to look at all the people who
are friends with Charlie so that means
it's the popularity of Diana the
popularity of Edgar and the popularity
of Fred but for each of those we need to
compute their popularity so the
popularity of Diana that's going to be
equal to the popularity of Alice so now
we're here but we need to keep going and
the popularity of alice is the
popularity of Edgar plus the popularity
of Bob but we need to keep going we
still need the popularity of Edgar well
that's the popular of Fred and we need
the popularity of Bob which is the
popularity of Fred and we need the
popularity of Fred which is the
popularity of Charlie plus the
popularity of Bob so this is not okay
right the problem is we started trying
to figure out the popularity of Charlie
we did all this work following these
links backward and now to solve it we
need to know the popularity of Charlie
but that's what we're trying to solve so
this is not a recursive definition to be
a good recursive definition we have to
end up with a simpler version of the
problem and never go back to the one
that we started with the way we've
defined it we get back to the one that
we started with we haven't made any
progress we're never going to get an
answer Charlie will be very unhappy
because we'll never know how popular he
is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
