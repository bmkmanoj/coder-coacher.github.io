with is not this idea of coming up with
a good partitioning for the input domain
but rather the notion of test coverage
and what test coverage is doing is it's
trying to accomplish exactly same thing
but partitioning was accomplishing but
it goes about it in a different way test
coverage is an automatic way of
partitioning the input domain leave some
observed features of the source code so
let me say what I mean so one particular
kind of test coverage that we might aim
for and this is sort of an easy kind of
test coverage it's called function
coverage and function coverage is
achieved if we manage to test our system
in such a way that every function in our
source code gets executed during testing
we're gonna be dividing our input
demanded chunks where any test case in
this part of the input space is going to
result for example in a call to foo so
now there's going to be some different
subset of our input domain and any point
in this subset of the input domain when
used as a test input it's going to
result in a different function in the
system under test let's say bar being
called we can keep subdividing the
infant domain for the software under
test until we've split it into parts
that result in every function being
called so now of course doing this in
theory is easy in practice we start with
a set of test cases and we run them all
through the software under test we see
which functions are called and then
we're gonna end up with some sort of a
score so for example some sort of a tool
that's watching our software execute can
say well we've called 181 out of 250
functions and so with this kind of a
score is called as a test coverage
metric it means that our test cases so
far have covered 181 of the functions
out of the 250 that we implemented and
so now that we've achieved this goal
that we had which is assigning a score
to a collection of test cases the next
thing we have to ask is does the score
any good is that good test coverage to
have executed on 181 out of our 250
functions well this example it's
probably not so we can do is for each of
the functions that wasn't covered we can
go and look at it and we can try to come
up with a test input that causes that
function to execute there's some
function Baz here and we can't seem to
devise an input that causes it to
execute then there are a couple of
possibilities one possibility is is that
it can't be called at all it's dead code
another possibility is is that we simply
don't understand their system well
enough to be able to trigger it either
way there's something possibly
suspicious are wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
