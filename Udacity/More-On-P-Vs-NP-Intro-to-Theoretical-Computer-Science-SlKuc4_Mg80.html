unit when I introduced you to
non-determinism and the if-better
function and we also talked about
simulating the if-better function and
how this takes exponential time to do
and I imagine your first reaction to
this might have been a mild version of
so what or even this is ridiculous but
now think what this means in the context
of NP completeness if for any
np-complete problem you find a
deterministic algorithm that runs in
polynomial time then you have also found
a way to simulate a non-deterministic
Ram in polynomial time which would mean
that a normal deterministic Ram without
the if-better function is just as
powerful as one that has this function
which of course seems a bit strange
because our intuition of course tells us
that having this if better function is
super super powerful and and should
somehow make a difference so the cool
thing is there's only two possibilities
either all and P complete problems can
be solved in polynomial time which would
essentially mean that P equals NP so any
problem that can be solved in polynomial
time on a non-deterministic Ram can be
solved in polynomial time on a
deterministic Ram or in other words a
deterministic Ram is just as powerful as
a non-deterministic one or that could be
the other case and that is no NP
complete problem can be solved in
polynomial time so P does not equal NP
there are certain problems that you can
solve in polynomial time if you have the
if-better function available but you
cannot solve them in polynomial time if
you don't have this function so
basically say P does not equal NP is the
same as saying that the if-better
function is really powerful so which one
isn't it and that question is the famous
P versus NP problem because the thing is
we don't know nobody knows asking this
question here if P equals NP or P does
not equal NP is a problem that is
decades old and yet nobody has been able
to figure it out now given how powerful
this if-better function is remember when
I introduced it to you it seemed like
this magic function that could solve all
of our problems many computer scientists
nowadays that P does not equal NP but
nobody has been able to prove it on the
other hand also nobody has been able to
find a polynomial time algorithm for any
single and P complete problem
despite literally thousands of
practically irrelevant and P complete
problems being out there now let's think
a little bit of how you could resolve
this questions so how could you show
that P equals NP or P does not equal NP
and we'll do that as a quiz so I'm going
to give you a number of accomplishments
or things that you could do and I would
like you to tell me what would that show
so for example if you found a polynomial
time algorithm for an NP complete
problem with that show that P equals NP
would that show that P does not equal NP
or would that show nothing interesting
and what if you found an algorithm that
solves an MP complete problem in
polynomial time on average so not
worst-case running time but average case
running time and what about if you
showed that the most efficient algorithm
for clique requires exponential time on
the deterministic Ram of course when
that show that P equals NP P does not
equal NP or something else or we don't
know what have you showed that the
vertex cover problem has an exponential
number of potential solutions that any
algorithm has to go through what if he
were able to reduce the clique problem
to the shortest path problem so shortest
path is finding the shortest path
between two vertices in a graph what if
you were to reduce clique to the problem
of finding the shortest path between two
vertices in a graph or what if you could
show that any shortest path problem in a
graph can be solved by solving clique in
a transformed graph so please make your
selection which ones are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
