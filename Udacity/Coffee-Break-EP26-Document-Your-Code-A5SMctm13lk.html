camera hi I'm Sean Bennett a course
architect and software engineer here at
Udacity and we're going to just take a
quick coffee break here to talk about
why documenting your code is so
important computer science is a highly
collaborative study especially when
you're looking at the working world
everyone works together to pull out and
put together this beautiful product
let's look at facebook and let's look at
google you're going to see thousands of
programmers sitting in different rooms
coding and sharing their ideas as well
as lots of people coming in who want to
enhance your idea or perhaps change your
idea and you're not always going to be
able to be there to explain it so
documenting your code is really really
important to be able to work as a very
fast paced efficient team and to make
impact on the products that you work on
very quickly so those were some great
points and I'd like to just add to those
a little bit because i'm actually in the
middle of a project a little bit of
debugging from mike own code about a
year and a half old and some of the
other software engineers here are trying
to figure out what i was doing and i was
looking at it and i can't really figure
it out too well either it's there's some
comments in there but it could be better
done and better documented so i'd really
recommend documenting your code and
making sure it's written in a clean
readable fashion that both other people
and yourself can read a year or two down
the road because you never know when
you're going to have to go back and look
at your own code and fix something so
thanks a lot for joining me for this
coffee break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
