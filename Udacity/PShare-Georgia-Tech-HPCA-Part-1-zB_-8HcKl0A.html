share predictor it has a private history
for each branch that is each branch
should have its own history in the
branch history table and it has shared
counters so that different histories and
different branches might map to the same
counters this predictor is good for
things like even odd behavior like taken
not taken loops with few iterations for
example those eight iteration loops that
we have seen and so on so pretty much
whenever the branch's own previous
behavior is predictive of its future
behavior P share tends to do well
another type of similar predictor that
we can make is called G share it has a
global history and shared counters so a
global history means that there is only
a single global history that we used to
predict all branches so what we have is
now the PC a single history that we
exert together and index into the array
of two bit counters this history every
branch decision regardless of what the
PC of the branches gets shifted in here
so what is G sure good for it's good for
so called correlated branches that is
branches whose decision is related to
what the other branches in the program
we're doing now I would think when would
that happen and it turns out that it
happens in programs quite often think
about something like this if my shape is
a square then do something then do
something that you do either way
regardless of what the shape is then if
the shape is not square I have something
else to do this branch and this branch
are entirely correlated if this one was
taken this one will not be taken and the
other way around so if this branch is in
the history when this one is being
predicted then we can perfectly predict
this branch note that however if we look
at this branch individually or this
branch individually the history of this
branch might be completely random
because it really depends on our data
whether shapes are squares so if we
randomly have shapes that are squares or
not we cannot really predict much here
so this branch
might be mispredicted often because we
simply don't know at that point but this
branch becomes perfectly predictable if
it's using the history produced by this
branch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
