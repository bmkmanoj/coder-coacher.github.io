different vantage points stress as a
stimulus and stress as a response first
we have stressed the stimulus this looks
at stress as the result of a particular
stimulus here we're saying that stress
is the result of a stressor in other
words an event that triggers stress in
the example we discussed earlier the
stressor could be the 10 page paper that
needs to be written another example
would be writing a check that you
realize that you don't have the money in
your bank account to cover or getting in
an argument with your roommate or a
friend any of those things could be
stressors the idea here is that a
situation causes stress the other
vantage point from which psychologists
view stress is stress as a response here
psychologists look at the physiological
changes or reactions that happen when we
encounter a stressful situation think of
this is what's happening inside of your
body when we're stressed here we'll see
things that happen in the body when we
experience acute stress as well as
chronic long-term exposure to stress
stress as a stimulus looks at what
causes the stress and stress as a
response looks at how the body responds
to stress when we're stressed but let's
go to Susan to start with examining
stress as a stimulus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
