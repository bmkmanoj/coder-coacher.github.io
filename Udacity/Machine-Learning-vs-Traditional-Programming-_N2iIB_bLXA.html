differ from traditional programming well
when we write a traditional program we
usually build the decision-making
directly into the program so if we
wanted to develop a program that could
recognize my face we would tell it look
for glasses look for brown eyes look for
brown hair with machine learning though
we wouldn't actually tell it any of that
we would build an agent that could look
at a bunch of images over time and
figure out who I am on its own we would
give it a bunch of pictures of myself
and a bunch of pictures of other people
and let it figure out on its own
hey he's the guy with the brown hair and
the brown eyes in the classes now
setting apart machine learning also is
the fact that it's only recently become
feasible for us to be able to address
these very large data sets with
computational methods computers have
finally come along and become fast
enough to be able to address the kinds
of datasets that we have available to us
now and also helping it is the fact that
the world is more reliant on computers
than ever before so much data is
generated kind of automatically while
people are going about their everyday
lives so these things really unite to
make machine learning a much more useful
tool right now than it would have ever
been before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
