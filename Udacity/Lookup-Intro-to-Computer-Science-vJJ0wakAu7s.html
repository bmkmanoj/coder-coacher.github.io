up to do it's gonna take a hash-table in
a word its output is gonna be the value
associated with that keyword what we
want look up to do is like ad first
thing it has to do is find the right
bucket and we've defined this procedure
hash-table get bucket to make it easy to
do that once we found the bucket what we
want to do for lookup is go through all
the entries in that bucket see if
there's one where the key of that entry
matches the word that we're passing it
so your goal is to define a procedure
we'll call it a hash table underscore
lookup it takes two inputs a hash table
and a key which is a string and it
outputs the value associated with that
key whenever you're asked to define a
procedure you should think carefully
whether the description is clear enough
in this case it's not there's a
situation that this description doesn't
cover we need to think about the case
where the key is not actually in the
table what should we do then
there's a lot of different things we
could do we could produce an error the
problem with producing it errors then
we've got to deal with it when we call
it we'd like to instead produce a value
that we can use to represent the case
where there's no entry associated with
that key and we'll use the none value
for that so if the key is not in the
table the result of lookup should be
none which means there's no value
associated with that key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
