grace is a word grace is the word grease
is the word hopper is a word and 1906
could match a number this looks very
good here grace is a word some white
space hopper is a word some white space
one is a number but because there's
white space between the one and the nine
this is going to register as four
different numbers instead of just one so
it doesn't match this specification
exactly here we have grace followed by
hopper in quotes and as we've defined
things previously this actually does
qualify as a word let's go back and see
why remember that our definition forward
was anything that's not a space a left
angle bracket or right angle bracket and
the double quote certainly fits in there
so it may not be what we want right now
but if you were sharp and notice that
this qualifies as a word under our rules
good I then 1906 is number here we have
grace as the word hopper is a word Oh
906 is a word so this is three words
rather than two words in a number and
grace hopper is of particular
significance to programming language and
compiler people because she's the origin
of the word bug meaning mistake in
program she is credited with finding the
first computer bug a moth that his work
had worked its way into the machinery
and removing it and recording it or
whatnot and thus repairing the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
