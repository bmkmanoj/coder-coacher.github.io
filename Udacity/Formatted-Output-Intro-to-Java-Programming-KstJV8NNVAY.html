turn to another topic formatted output
let me show you why we need to know
about it let's look at this program here
I want to buy a hundred cans of my super
premium canned food at four dollars
thirty five I can so my total price is
going to be the quantity times the unit
price so I print it there's also eight
percent tax so here I'm figure under the
tax and then I'm printing that let's see
what this program does well look at it
it's ugly ugly here I expect it to see
four hundred and thirty five dollars and
the tax you never see tax like that on
your store receipt it would say thirty
four dollars and eighty cents so that's
what I want and by the way I want these
decimal points here to line up it turns
out that's pretty easy to do here
instead of just calling print on will
call a different method it's called
printf for print formatted and here we
need to add a formatting string the
formatting string is here it looks a
little arcane the percent says we're now
going to be printing something the H
means we want it to be eight characters
wide the point two means we're on two
digits after the decimal point the F
means it's a floating point or decimal
number the backslash n means and
afterwards please give us a new line as
you can see there's a whole mini
language in these formatting strings and
you will practice a few of them with
Sarah after I'm done here but truth be
told if you simply memorize this one or
even better just copy and paste it when
you need it that's ninety percent of
what you need let me do just that so
here again I'm reusing printf I'm saying
I want filled with eight two digits
after the decimal point now when we run
the program everything is nice and
beautiful both numbers have two digits
after the decimal point both of them
occupy eight characters as a general
rule whenever you display prices go
ahead and use printf you'll practice
that with Sarah right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
