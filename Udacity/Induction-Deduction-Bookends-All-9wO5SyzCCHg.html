topics to understand the machine
learning so let's pause for a moment and
go over them in more detail with a
segment from Ashok's in my artificial
intelligence course note especially the
machine learning is largely about
induction let us look at abduction more
closely to understand these similarities
in difference between deduction
abduction and induction let us look at
the relationship between a rule cause
and effect let's consider a simple rule
like if it is cloudy it rains so it is
cloudy is the cause it rains is the
effect if it is cloudy then it rains is
the rule another example of a role would
be the rule that Bob hates gel so Bob HL
so whenever Joe walks in Bob leaves the
cause is you're walking in the effect is
bound leaving and the rule is bob h gel
you've already come across yet another
instance of this particular arrangement
when we were talking about flu and fever
so the rule might be if flu then fever
flu is the cause fever is the effect now
in deduction in one fundamental kind of
inference we know the rule and the cause
and we need to deduce the effect so
given the rule if it is cloudy then it
rains and given the cause it is cloudy
we can deduce that it rains similarly in
our rule that Bob hecho we can say that
if Joe just walked in we can deduce the
Bob will leave or if the rule is if flu
and fever and we know that Ashok has flu
then we can deduce that Ashok has fever
this is simply an instance of modus
ponens and we discuss this in detail
when we were talking about logic now let
us look at induction given a
relationship between a consonant effect
we can try to induce a rule for example
if we observe repeatedly that when it is
cloudy it rains then maybe induce a rule
if it is cloudy then it rains same thing
with Bob and Joe if we observe
repeatedly that every time Joe arrives
Bob leaves we can induce a rule the Bob
must hate gel if every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu and a patient
has fever then we can induce a rule if
flu then fever in case of abduction
given a rule and an effect we can abuse
a cause
as an example given the rule if it is
cloudy then it rains and the effect that
it is raining we can ask ourselves is it
cloudy and once again with Bob and Joe
given our rule that Bob hates Joe and
given that we just arrived at a party
and we see that Joe is here but not Bob
we might be able to Abdullah from Joe
arrived or given the rule if flu then
fever and the fact that Ashok has fever
we might be able to abuse that Ashok has
flu first of all notice that we are back
to diagnosis diagnosis as an instance of
abduction but notice several other
properties first deduction is truth
preserving if the rule is true and the
cause is true we can always garden key
the effect is true as well induction and
abduction are not truth preserving we
may know something about the
relationship between cause and effect
for some sample that does not mean that
the same relationship holds for the
entire population induction does not
always guarantee correctness same for
abduction we may know the rule and the
effect and we may suppose that it causes
true but that need not necessarily be
true it may be the case if flu then
fever and a shock may have fever but
there does not necessarily mean that a
show-cause flu fever can be caused by
many many things the reason that fever
does not necessarily mean that Ashoka's
fluids because there can be multiple
causes for the same effect multiple
hypotheses were the same data this is
exactly the problem that we had
encountered earlier when we were talking
about what makes diagnosis hard we said
the deduction induction and abduction
are three of the fundamental forms of
inference we can of course also combine
these inferences science is a good
example you and I are scientists observe
some data by the world then we abuse
some explanation for it having Abdul
straight explanation for it we induce a
room
having induced a rule now we can use
production to predict new data elements
we go and observe some more again we
abuse induce reduce and we continue the
cycle microcycle also explained
significant part of cognition is this
what you and I do on a daily basis abuse
induce reduce in machine learning what
we're largely interested in doing is
induction taking some data in which we
speculate cause-and-effect relationship
exists and inducing a rule the rule
essentially need to be causal it's a
right of the rules about correlation the
important thing is inducing a rule that
will allow us to make sense of data in
the future that rule can then be applied
deductively or abductive lee in trading
for example we might apply that rule
deductively to protect what stocks will
gain value or abducted lee to decide
where insider trading has already
occurred so now that you have a good
grasp of induction let's get back to
