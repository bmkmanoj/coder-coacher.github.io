inputs and K outputs you have n plus 1
times K parameters to use not one more
the thing is you might want to use many
many more parameters in practice also
its linear this means that the kind of
interactions that you're capable of
representing with that model is somewhat
limited for example if two inputs
interact in an additive way your model
can represent them well as a matrix
multiply but if two inputs interacts in
a way that the outcome depends on the
product of the two for example you won't
be able to model that efficiently with a
linear model linear operations are
really nice though big matrix multiplies
are exactly what GPUs were designed for
they're relatively cheap and very very
fast numerically linear operations are
very stable you can show mathematically
that small changes in the input can
never yield big changes in the output
the derivatives are very nice to the
derivative of a linear function is
constant you can't get more stable
numerically than a constant so we would
like to keep our parameters inside big
linear functions but we would also want
the entire model to be nonlinear we
can't just keep multiplying our inputs
by linear functions because that's just
equivalent to one big linear function so
we're going to have to introduce
nonlinearities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
