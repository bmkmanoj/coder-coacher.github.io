architecture firm to learn the basics of
designing and planning for the
construction of new buildings this isn't
just any architecture firm though it
just so happens to be the firm that
designs the new office for grants
cleaning glasses company so we're going
to go back in time to follow Athena
through the work that went into creating
grants awesome new space since Athena is
just getting used to being part of the
world of architecture at all firm gave
her a pretty simple project to work on
it first since grants such a fun guy he
wanted his office to have a separate
space just for having fun thus the fun
room which Athena gets to plan grants
picked out a very special wallpaper that
he wants used in this room and it has a
pattern that he wants to make sure it is
fully expressed on every wall but he
also wants her to be natural light in
the room so he wants windows along two
of the walls however since he's not
willing to sacrifice any of that
wallpaper pattern the two walls with the
windows on them are going to have to be
longer than the other two walls let's
call the distance from one wall to the
edge of a window X and assume that each
of these windows are placed in the
center of either wall so that there's a
distance of X on either side now since
grant loves natural light so much he
wants these windows to be really big in
fact he's already picked out surprise
surprise the exact windows that he wants
and they are each three meters across
now since we're calling each of these
lengths of wall X we know that this
length of all is going to be equal to
the sum of those two so this is just 2x
now the thing that Athena needs to
figure out is how much carpet is going
to need to be laid down in the fun room
so considering these side lengths and
your understanding of area of rectangles
please come up with an expression for
the number of square meters of carpet
Athena's going to need for this room you
can either multiply or not multiply out
your answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
