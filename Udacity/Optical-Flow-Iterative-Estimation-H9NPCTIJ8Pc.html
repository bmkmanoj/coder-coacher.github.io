2 and those are meant to be as taken in
two different times and here I'm just
looking at this point X 0 and just so
you understand this is the value at if
you will time 2 this is the value at
time 1 and that's true for all of these
and the question is how much does the
curve move so what I have to do is I
want to find this displacement at X 0
all right so do it as follows so here's
how we do we initialize since this is
iterative initialize we'll first start
by assuming that our displacement was
zero that is U and V are all zeros
everywhere that's great that makes the
warp really really fast
I don't do anything it's the original
picture now I have to estimate the next
one d1 by figuring out what the new
displacement is that's what this new
little Delta D is going to be so how do
I do that
well I have to compute these tangents
and you can see the tangents are right
there
okay and what I do is based upon that
tangent come down here it says oh okay
if this thing we're actually a plane
this amount that's my D hat that's the
amount I have to displace over in order
to line up these points that's assuming
this thing we're plane and if it really
were a plane that would be the amount
that I would have to move so let me do
that displacement and I end up there so
now I've got my d1 which was just d0
plus my new estimate and guess what I
have to do it again so now I take a look
and say ah I have to move this amount so
I add that to my D and I move it that
much and guess what I do it again that's
to make tiny little D hat this time and
voila it turns out that F 1 of X minus
d3 is almost exactly F 2 at this point
okay
that's the iterative refinement and the
only thing that it takes in order to do
this iterative lucas-kanade e beyond the
regular one is this warping step given
some UV that you've computed between one
image and the next take that first image
warp it through that that flow field and
now you'll have almost
the second image and you just apply it
over again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
