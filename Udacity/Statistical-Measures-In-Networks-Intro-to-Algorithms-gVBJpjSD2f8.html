how a company like Facebook could use
information about things like like users
clicking on a like button on something
to suggest possible people to be friends
with right um so a simple way is this
idea that let's assume have meri jaan
and jail right and Mary is friends with
John and Jill but John and Jill are not
friends with each other and every time
Mary posts something both John and Jill
like it right so because they keep
liking the things that Mary post we
think well they should like each other
as well and want to be friends and in
fact the reason another reason that it
make sense to have them be friends is
that they're both friends with Mary
right and so they share a common friend
and they life a lot of stuff that Mary
is posting and so that would be a good
friend suggestion and the more actually
friends they have in common the higher
this idea of oh well they will want to
be friends because they share a lot of
common friends and this is a whole area
called thai strength about you know how
strongly am I tied to you or would I be
tied to you and we actually recently had
a paper in web science conference on
this so when I actually go out of my way
and like something it means that and you
go out of your way and like it it means
that maybe we should be friends because
we like the same kinds of things it's
also connected to the concept of
homophily of this idea of like
attracting like been around in history
for a very long time in fact it dates
all the way back to play dough which
says similarity baguettes friendship and
or for example in more common day we say
birds of a feather flock together right
and so in a social network links tend to
connect people who are similar to one
another right so I'm similar to you and
so I would like to be your friends and
so I have a link to you for example you
want to find out about whether I'm a
good guy or a bad guy right you can look
at my friends and see you know if the
majority of them are good guys or bad
guys and if the majority of them are
good guys then you would guess while
Tina must be a good
because she's friends with a lot of good
guys right and so that that idea and
that's where also this idea of ego net
come along so even it is a term in
sociology and it refers to the ego and
then i have my alters which are my
friends so my friends are my altars and
the person you're considering is called
the ego and the ego net is the network
that connects the ego to the altars and
that connects the altars together so you
can have ego nets that look like a star
where you have the ego and links to all
altars but none of the altars know each
other or you can have a cliq where
everybody knows each other in this ego
net right the ego know that obviously
knows all Oh tourism is friends with all
the altars and all the altars are
friends with each other right and in
fact going back to this idea of
recommending links um the closer the the
more clicky your ego net is the more
links there are in your ego net they're
more likely it is that the authors that
aren't connected to each other what Ron
to be kind of sweetie now we've looked
at something in the class called the
clustering coefficient is it safe to to
kind of define that as the density of
the connections among your alters or if
you want to think about it you know the
number of triangles that exist right in
your net so selection is the tendency of
people to form friendship with others
who are like them right as if you wanted
to targeted a app for a particular
product you're assuming that their
selection going influence is the fact
that we're already friends and people
may change their behavior to bring them
more closely into the alignment with
their friends right and that's why for
example a lot of viral marketing is good
for so if you're trying to push
something where and the underlying
causes social influence then you would
want to go with viral marketing and so
was selection again visual
characteristics drive the formation of
links of the friendship links and then
with influence is the existing links in
the networks you know people's
characteristics so you know I
like it i play with it and that
influences you to go buy buy an iPhone
and usually when people talk about
influence they also talk about contagion
is basically the same kind of a term
people use it interchangeably and there
was just very I guess famous study back
in two thousand seven I got a lot of
publicity that was done by a professor
christakis at Harvard and Horsa Fowler
at unity of California San Diego and
they looked at how obesity is is caused
by influence that obesity is contagious
right that they had this thing where you
know how these friend increases your
chance of obesity by 57% and that was
when it got like everything was
contagion happens it's just everything
was contagious and there's all these
like Time magazine had a front cover and
Wired magazine and all that then when
people look more into the model they
found that well wait a second if I
follow the model then tautness is also
contagious fortunately it's not because
I would like to be taller but I'm not
really gets down to this idea of
correlation and causation lots and lots
of interesting work end with real
applications right like if I have a
product that I want to spread through a
network if I or if I want people to
change their behavior and stop smoking
is it influence or is a selection
because depending on which one it is I
should've either viral marketing or
targeted I'm outraged so it's very
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
