problem is to do a good job is that as
the person running the random tester you
need to do a pretty good job filtering
the bugs that you find so that you only
pass the ones that look important once
it look like there might be critical or
security problems or something on to the
developers and if you find a bunch of
bugs that they never see this isn't a
problem if you find it bugs if you find
a bunch of bugs that they that they are
never going to see this isn't
necessarily a problem it uses your time
but use your time so if you find a bunch
of bugs that aren't that you never pass
on to developers this isn't necessarily
a problem you've learned interesting
things about the software under test and
if you and if you make the decision to
not pass these on then that's probably
okay it's not uncommon for a simple
random tester to spend all of its time
performing boring tests so for example
if we do a bad job generating HTML then
maybe all of our tests result in
rejection by the HTML parser and we
never find anything interesting and our
two responses to this kind of thing one
response is simply to put more resources
into the random tester for example we
can use more cores we can use machines
with more memory or maybe we can just
make random testing faster by reducing
the size of the inputs that we're
generating the other response as we've
discussed several times is to make the
random test case generator smarter that
is to say to use our human expertise our
human knowledge of the domain of
interest in order to generate random
test cases that aren't boring random
tester may find the same bug many many
many times and if we can automatically
reject repeated instances of a bug this
isn't a problem on the other hand if we
don't have an automated way to do triage
of issues that we've found then this can
really waste somebody's time and this is
an issue that will talk about explicitly
a little bit later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
