the projects that we're working on but
the thing that gets me the most excited
is systematizing innovation how can we
go through the process of figuring out
which is almost always the case nope
that wasn't what we should be doing a
little bit more efficiently because
that's the rate-limiting step of
innovation great scientists celebrate
the process of asking great questions
and getting well-formed answers they
don't celebrate success that's the wrong
thing to celebrate that doesn't move
science for it's actually the big
problem with academia is that it
disproportionately celebrates success
and so if we're serious about winning
about achieving in the long term we have
to recognize that the process of winning
is ninety percent learning so I'd go
through this exercise too hey you you're
just starting at X mr. Sebastian the
last project you worked on when you were
done if you lost all the the tools of
all the software but you can keep the
people and everything that was in your
heads about the project you had built
and you had to rebuild the thing once it
was working from scratch how long would
it take you as a percentage of your time
five and you say five to ten percent of
your time okay we need a name for the
other ninety five percent of the work
for lack of a better term let's call
that learning so the entire process of
innovation is the process of learning
and how to make that as efficient as
possible and if that's the case which I
think we just agreed it is then let's
celebrate being awesome at that
ninety-five percent the last five
percent is easy anyone can do that it's
actually relatively easy to get
thousands of interesting ideas onto the
table metaphorically the question then
is how do we pau through them
efficiently so for some you can say oh
look this proposal actually if you just
turn it and think about it a little bit
you realize if this were possible it
actually is a perpetual motion machine
and you'd be surprised a good five
percent of the ideas can be thrown out
purely on the basis that they break some
law of physics then there are a set of
things where we can just do the math and
figure out that there's no business
behind it and not everything has to be a
business but things that aren't a
business are not likely to scale so for
some that you know pass those tests we
may have to subject them to other things
like have smart people already tried
this before see if the answer is yes are
we really that much smarter than
everybody else that's not a good enough
reason to think it's going to work we go
through this process where we've built
skills over time different mechanisms
for discovering that something might not
be good eventually we get to the place
where there are some things left on the
table we might have to build some
prototypes we might have to start hiring
some people and only discover six months
from now that it's not a good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
