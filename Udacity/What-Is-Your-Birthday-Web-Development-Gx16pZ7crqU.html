app we were working in before this is
the the main file where we're using I'm
not going to ask you to follow along
with me anymore because I'm going to be
writing more code and it's it'll be
tedious for you to try to keep up so
I'll try to type slowly and then we'll
quiz as I go so the first thing we're
gonna do is adjust this file to work
better for our needs so remember we were
submitting to a different URL before
we're submitting the slash test form
that's when we were learning about you
know multiple handlers we're gonna get
rid of that I'm gonna get rid of that
action parameter and we're going to get
rid of that whole handler we're not
going to be using that anymore and we're
also going to get rid of the URL
reference to that handler we don't need
that anymore
so now I've simplified this file quite a
bit we have our simple form that we are
using before and we have our main
handler that's mapped to by slash slash
Maps the main page here's main page with
a get function and this get function
just prints our form this is you know
the very simple example we started with
from the very beginning let's make sure
this still works so here we are in our
browser we've got our basic form
everything's as we expected it okay
let's go back to the editor so instead
of having this basic form with just a
text field we're gonna make a form to
ask somebody for their birthdays so we
can validate their inputs so let's get
rid of this input and we're going to ask
the user what is your birthday we'll
have a prank blank line and then we'll
have three inputs one for the month one
for the day and one for the year so I'll
go ahead and add those so I've updated
our form a little bit and as a string
what is your birthday a blank line three
inputs all of type text and they're
named month day and year two more blank
lines and then our submit button let's
check how that looks in our browser here
we are in our browser we've got our text
what is your birthday and we've got our
three inputs for month day and year and
I submit button I made the font a little
bigger in the browser so we could read
it better now this is not very clear
what we're asking for remember we have a
solution for that though let's add some
labels so we can see you know month day
and year next to our text inputs so here
we are in our editor again I'm going to
add a few labels okay so all I did is I
added label elements
like we did in previous examples here's
an opening label our old month input
some month text to appear next to our
text input and then the closing label
and I did that for each of these inputs
month day and year let's see how that
looks in our browser okay here in our
browser I've reloaded it and things are
looking nice now we can see that we're
asking for the month the day and the
year now I'm going to type in some data
here and I'd like you to tell me what
you think is gonna happen when I click
Submit so when I hit submit on that form
what do you think is going to happen
will the form clear well we get an error
405 because we never added a post
handler to slash we'll see the form
values in the URL or the app countdown
to my birthday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
