everybody readings we are now live hey
everyone hopefully you can all hear us
on there on the YouTube feed and thanks
thanks very much for joining us so
welcome to our robotics nanodegree AMA
session and so I am Andy I'm at the UK
brief manager based in London dusty and
joining me on on the call today we have
we Ryan
Chris Thomas and Brennan and so Chris
and Ryan are both both plus the Udacity
team so Chris is the robotics product
manager for the robotics nanodegree and
Ryan is the robotics curriculum lead and
and we have special guests joining us
from our partners electric movement and
so Brandon is the CTO and software
engineer and so guys if you could do a
quick introduction now Ichi that'd be
great please sure I'll just start so yea
I'm Ryan nice to meet you all
and glad you could join us I was working
previously on the self-driving car and I
don't agree program at Udacity and
recently have moved over to working on
robotics so we're really excited putting
together some awesome curriculum for all
you guys and we're we're happy to tell
you more filling some gaps maybe give
some details and all that so excited to
be here in Brandon I'm the CTO here at
electric movement we do product
engineering and development in the area
of robotics
we're super excited to team up with
Udacity to develop this this content
hello I'm Thomas currently working at
software engineer here I love
movement background in mechanical
engineering and PhD in biomedical
engineering my dissertation work
actually focused on the type of under
actuated robot and yeah super excited
about this curriculum and hope you guys
enjoy it yeah and I guess I'll wrap it
up hey guys I'm Chris apartment your
great Udacity previously people working
on our Android programs but really
excited to join hands for a move effort
as we launch a new program in the world
of robotics super excited to partner
with electric movement to offer a really
powerful curriculum for you that we're
going to talk about in a sec so I want
to I want to say thanks to Andy for
having us as well thank you all for
hanging out and taking some time out of
your evenings to touch a chat and hang
out with us greatness which oh it's a
highlight that's a that we have Leia who
is runs marketing and communications for
you dusty duck she's based in Berlin and
she's moderating the other live chat on
the YouTube feed as well and so so you
can say hi to her and she'll be a she'll
be helping moderate the AMA session as
we as we get going with the life
questions yeah so hop on over to the
youtube link if you haven't already
child later all right so let's switch to
a presentation real quick see
can you guys see this I can represent
everyone thanks okay so hey guys thanks
again for joining happy to be here gonna
be talking about our new upcoming
robotics nanodegree program you probably
thought you might have seen the
announcement a few weeks ago and our
intersect conference there's lots of
details on UNESCO for / robotics but
let's jump in and just do a quick
overview the program oops so let's start
this talk about who we are you know this
is this is kind of a new project for
Udacity and you know it's it's the first
time we're doing a joint partnership to
create the content again we're
partnering with logic movement who's a
leading robotic solutions consulting
firm here is in the Cisco Bay Area and
as we fill out this curriculum with with
folks like Thomas and Brandon and their
wonderful team here we also have a bunch
of initiative partners that are pledging
their support for the curriculum
companies they include Bosch and iRobot
Lockheed Martin and Google X megabots
and even ubers autonomous technologies
group as well so the reason you know
let's talk about something's really
exciting and I think it's something
really interesting is the fact that
technology has changed so rapidly
there's a lot of powerful affordable
hardware now and there's been a lot of
advancements in software to the point
where machines could have really
powerful artificial intelligence
capabilities and there's an opportunity
to merge that ability with the the
opportunity to interact with the
physical world you know traditionally
some of us we might think about robotics
from pop culture what we might think
about Star Wars or Robocop or we're
getting more recent innovations like
wall-e and while there can be this
metallic humanoid connotation there's
really this kind of powerful underlying
set of functionality that really makes
robotics what it is and and that's the
idea that you know you can sense the
environment you can make some really
intelligent decisions and then you can
interact based on that information and
that kind of flow kind of repeats itself
and and at the core that's what we'd
like to say is that core robotics energy
and that applies to so many industries
and kind of growing opportunity from you
know starting with say space exploration
to military applications we're seeing a
lot of new businesses kind of take off
with with approaching last mile delivery
scenarios whether it be delivering
packages or supplying medicine to remote
areas and and robotics gonna be personal
do so you know you can assist with
powerful scenarios in the home or even
when you're looking to streamline or
automates improvements to to farming and
then there's a even deeper human side
with you know a huge potential of
medical applications including
situations like surgical robots even
assisting kind of rehab situations would
say physical therapy and then you know
looking forward into our lives and how
to have a tighter connection between
technology as we age for example so as
we saw this space starting you know it's
in relatively infant stages be ready to
grow we decided to create the robotic
standard review program which is really
about a project-based learning by doing
curriculum that's design and energy it's
inspired to get you to be ready for a
creator and robotics now it's it's a
relatively aggressive condensed program
it's six months consisting into two
terms three months each again you can
find more details at Udacity got comm
forward slash robotics but we're here
live so happy to take some more
questions as we go through the material
a bit mark what we published so far
again one of the key aspects of our
and experience is to really provide
folks with practical really powerful
useful off the ground experiences for
careers in robotics we're working on a
full two term curriculum as I mentioned
but we published some of the details for
our first term and we were really going
to focus on some key elements that help
drive the workflow of modern-day
roboticists things like Ross or the
robot operating system framework even
some kind of deep physics science in the
world of kinematics and as I alluded to
before there's so many advancements in
software would be covering things like
computer vision we'll also go over some
important algorithms like such as P PID
for control and we'll even apply some
really powerful deep learning and the
use of neural nets for certain tasks in
robotics so who's who's is program for
now this is a pretty aggressive program
and it does require some technical
background for success so we we highly
recommend that folks that are interested
in the program already have some comfort
of familiarity with object-oriented
programming particularly Python will be
great as a start and you know experience
would say something a little bit more
low-level like c++ ism is a plus but
yeah there's so many aspects of robotics
again that requires some just general
math background so it's important to
have some some foundational calculus
linear algebra and some experience with
probability and statistics as well in
addition to some just basic physics so
just just as an example of it you know
folks who come from technical
backgrounds like electrical engineering
computer science mechanical engineering
industrial engineering math physics and
needs of mild medical situations could
be best set up for success in this
program so that's a quick overview of
the tone points and I just wanted to
kick it over to to Andy for a couple
questions
yeah thanks Chris for that overview that
was a really helpful and and so all of
you who are watching thanks also for
sending in your questions in advance and
so we've been through when we picked out
some of the the most frequently asked
questions and so we're going to post
those over to the team now and I wanted
to start with with Ryan and you
mentioned that you were previously
working on the self-driving car
nanodegree program and one of the
questions that we received is how how
you see the AI program with the
self-driving car program and the
robotics program ring and how would a
student make up their mind us which
program they should take okay they were
back to I was just gonna wait until it
till the cameras pointed back at us but
I guess I can just start talking and
which eventually it'll be coming back
around yeah so we have we have a lot of
programs at Udacity now that it launched
started within the last year that have
some overlap so sometimes it's confusing
for students when it comes down to
choosing a program what which one is
really for me and so we have for example
one of the older programs that's all
that's related to all these is machine
learning so we've had that for a couple
of years at Udacity machine learning
come covers a whole bunch of different
techniques in machine learning and a
bunch of applications to different data
sets we've also launched an AI and a
deep learning a no degree program these
these are different from the machine
learning program but in a sense they're
similar because they're they're sampling
a whole bunch of different techniques
for dealing with big data sets for doing
complex analysis and and applying to a
whole bunch of different scenarios with
different with different data sets the
self-driving car and robotics programs
are different from those programs in the
sense that they're focused on one
problem well that one problem in
robotics but you've got the self-driving
car program which is focused on
techniques traditional sort of robotics
techniques as well as machine learning
deep learning techniques for
self-driving cars which you could think
of as like a subset of robotics the
robotics program will
be more in general will be focused on
robotics techniques and applications
that cover a wide range of industries so
we'll be looking at mobile robots like
wheeled robots we'll be looking at
kinematic arms and other scenarios of
drones and so it's it's sort of the the
robotics program is meant for someone
who's interested in robotics in general
rather than someone say who's just
interested in robotics applications as
as they apply to self-driving cars
hopefully that helps distinguish the
different programs listen thanks Anna
thanks for clarifying that and order to
turn the conversation over to the
Brandon and it's hummus and OH
where do you see the industry heading
you know perhaps over the next five
years and why should why should students
considering taking the robotics nano
degree be excited about the field and
you know the developments in the
industry that might be might be coming
up for the future so that's a really
great question we're gonna see a lot of
interesting developments here soon
particular industries are really
starting to take off so as one of you
guys mentioned earlier you know we have
industries like agriculture we're gonna
see robots for doing things like
harvesting and planting and sorting
fruit you've got like social robots
where we're going to see robots in the
home maybe interactive toys using deep
learning for children also medical
robots is is really taking off and I
think the thing that's really driving
change here is reduction in costs so
reduction in cost and compute is
allowing for great things with
algorithms reduction in cost of
actuators because because of the
reduction in compute you're gonna see
the actuators getting really cheap and
reduction in the cost of sensors once
again the cost of compute is meaning
that we can use image sensors for doing
things that you know we never would have
been able to do before so cheaper robots
meat industry and applications and
ubiquitous yeah I think if we can drive
the cost a lot of this since there's a
computing technology we can make the
systems more reliable more robust and
once we reach that state of technical
perfection then it'll be easier for
industry and people to you know begin
trusting and adopting it it'll just
become part of everybody's lives so I
think that's really exciting
opportunities that sounds great and so
it says pretty clear that there's a
there's going to be plenty of
opportunity in the industry and but
opening up to all of you and what kind
of career opportunities graduates of the
robotics and degree programs
specifically be expecting to consider
once they once they complete program
yeah sure so I mean the whole the whole
idea here is that this this curriculum
is supposed to be practical so if you've
got the prerequisites and you take the
course we've you know we've worked with
industry partners kind of asking them
what is it that they're looking for and
we think that that the curriculum
represents the kind of skills that
you'll need for for placement in the
industry so you know Ross skills skills
with sensors and and manipulators and
learning how to design robots and
simulations that will prepare you very
well just to add on top of that I mean
when we started creating this program we
looked at like what do we do everything
in this program is basically a
reflection of what we do on a daily
basis so yeah I'm quite confident that
if you master these skills that and of
course that you will be an attractive
contender for at least an entry-level
robotics job yeah maybe we could just
kind of throw in a few examples of what
those jobs might be so like a company
like electric movement is doing a wide
range of different robotics applications
for different companies so that's kind
of a general robotics type of
application but there's there are other
ones that you might not expect like one
that I can kind of make me laugh when I
was just looking
you know different robotics houses
Tiffany jewelers is looking for a
roboticist you would think what why but
they want to cut diamonds better so of
course you know and you can think about
other industries where you might not
expect it or maybe where you would but I
don't you guys want to throw out a
couple more examples of like just
robotics jobs that are out there now our
companies that are looking for robot
Isis
yeah I think it's a very broad field and
I think companies that are smaller in
size startups like Tim that hire more
generalists because they don't have the
manpower to have people devoted to one
particular area so they have to have
people who can wear many hats
whereas larger companies could have a
fourth to like specialize in helps
alright one guy just devoted to slam or
perception or navigation or whatever so
I would say that as a general rule but
things that aren't necessarily called
robotics but just you know automation so
there's a lot of industrial automation
that's essentially robotics is just
somebody's that doesn't have the name
robotics what else yeah it's looking the
big companies there will be specific
positions like localization engineers
engineers they're dealing with
perception and you know making making
sense of the world yeah I mean I just
just kind of remembering some of the
initial research that we did when we
were building this program you know
again you know there's there's a set of
need for kind of general box knowledge
and then there is some coming in at a
very precise focused area so again this
program kind of touches on a bunch of
those things you know anywhere from you
know robotics still you know engineer at
say Amazon's were on delivery scenarios
you have you know robotics software
positions at places like ah Vaisakhi in
the product perhaps the automotive space
anywhere kind of your cutting edge drone
companies like the DJI looking for a
specific folks that say focus on other
controls so certainly a wide gamut of
jobs out there who that's three and then
Chris and Ryan I wonder if you could it
maybe speak to you how the program is
structured as such
so that it actually will prepare
students for jobs maybe particular
projects and then also that the hiring
partners and the other contenders that
we have lined up as well sure yeah talk
about that so the way that the audacity
firms in general are structured in order
to give students the skills they need
for our particular industry is that it's
all project-based learning so that is
that you learn these skills by doing the
projects and you are able to not just do
the projects in isolation but get
feedback and sort of networking with
from your peers and then also human
feedback when you submit the project on
what you need to improve or where things
went well but these projects that serve
as like portfolio pieces that you can
bring to an interview and talk about and
show and tell or you know post on your
own personal profile online and kind of
present yourself as someone with these
skills and and some demonstrated
knowledge there so the way the hiring
partner relationship works then is that
you create your Udacity profile which
will have your projects on it and will
have your resume there and maybe more
information about your background and
then hiring partners once you click the
turn recruiting access on but there
they're free to go through there and
pick out candidates that they want to
interview so for example the way the
self-driving car program now has
something like something over a thousand
students have graduated from terminal 1
it's a three term program but already
just after term rot one we have hundreds
of students getting contacted by
recruiters from industry because hiring
partners in that space are basically not
even willing to wait until these people
have done all three terms of the program
they're interested in picking people up
just even after term one so it's
basically that Udacity profile where
your projects are up for show and tell
your resume there tells me a little bit
about there tells the recruiter a little
bit about who you are and that's how we
make the connection between industry
partners and the students that are
coming through the program so we hope
for exactly the same thing to be
happening with robotics that it's not
just wait until the end of this tutoring
program to start talking to employers
but that as soon as we get through the
first term with the first group of
people that we start making those
connections so that's the plan yeah
nothing thanks Tara thanks for
clarifying and and unsurprisingly one of
the common questions that we had come up
was around hardware and how can we
happily students expect to learn
rebooked it without actually getting
hands-on with the hardware and I
wondered if maybe if Brandon you wanted
a little bit about you know the common
come in our projects that you work on it
electric riebmann and and you know the
differences between this software limit
and the hardware meant that you guys are
you guys see sure so I you know I think
that simulation is gonna get us a long
ways here and electric movement we've
got we've got a team of hardware
engineers we've got a team of software
engineers electrical engineers and when
we kick off a robotics project there
it's not like there's hardware or maybe
if there is one where there might just
be one you know it always takes time to
spin up more so you know what we do in
the meantime
software developers do simulation and
lots of it so the simulator can can give
us most of the way there with respect to
our development and then what we do is
we actually take that software and run
it on the real thing so the simulator is
you know simulating collisions it's
simulating all the physics it's
simulating all the sensor is all the
lighting everything you kind of expect
from the real world and then what we do
is that the software that we're
developing that is the real software the
software that actually runs on the robot
except for first first it interfaces
with the simulator yeah so I mean to
Brenda's point you know I think one of
the key things that we're trying to
really focus on providing as far as an
experience is concerned with this
program is to kind of focus on on system
integration ton point where you you not
only understand some of the algorithm is
for the math behind some of these
specific techniques say when you're
doing vision or you doing planning or
localization you're able to then
integrate or build those on top of the
real tool chain that you can use to the
point your your software a lot to actual
hardware so you know we're definitely
excited to build projects that
will largely focus on building the
software that's been deployed one
hardware but we are really excited to
announce that in turn two of the program
we're going to be releasing some
hardware so everything that you've been
building and learning about toolchain
wise in the program you will actually be
able to deploy on a hardware kit and and
we'll be releasing some more details on
what that hardware is to come but know
that it's going to feel at the top point
is it to feel is reliable and useful as
say debugging software that you might
write it on your phone so again focusing
on Ross the same simulation tools that
real roboticists use day-to-day you'll
be practicing that on every project that
you do in this program and then we'll
have some scenarios where you'll be able
to play it to its actual life hardware
other states are a quick question here
that came in online asking how much time
per week is estimated and so we're we're
estimating 15 hours per week so that's
kind of vary depending on what kind of
skills you're coming in within and how
things go but but that's that's what
we're estimating them all so let me let
me clarify one bit with the hardware
actually - we'll be shipping that in
term - and there is no additional cost
for this hardware kit it's it's bundled
with the press of the program just to be
clear for everyone ok and so what the
other question that came in was what is
the role of robotics you know that's one
of us driving ok I can take a stab at
that and then we'll pass it on the so I
was just like I said working on the
sunsetting car program before this so
I'm familiar with a lot of those a lot
of those applications that we're
teaching in that course for software in
cars but basically the role of robotics
in a self-driving car is quite similar
to the role of robotics in in any
robotics application you've kind of got
the same three steps of sense think act
or perception and decision making in
actuation and so in the case of a
self-driving car the perception step
might be taking in line
radar data or camera image data and then
using algorithms to decide what to do
based on the information you gain from
the perception step and then actuation
is in steering the car if rÃ¶tteln break
that sort of thing but it's the same
sort of process that you go through for
another robot so how many of you guys
could just give another example of
robotics that's similar in many ways but
in a totally different application sure
I mean I think to get to that point you
just really have to select different
actuators robotic cars don't have they
don't have arms you know they don't have
grass birds I don't have propellers so
they believe they travel on the ground
they might something to me that can
sense the can act I can't decide and you
have the self-driving car is just a
particular example but I mean if people
get a drone or a kinematic arm they do
those same three major tasks just with
different sensors different algorithms
it's the same basic thing just what
brought yeah actually just fitting off
that I we have I'm gonna butcher this I
apologize for still Chen three thousand
as asked you know I I saw a DJI Mavic
and one of the advertisements are you
playing on diving it's controlling DJI
copters in particular yeah and to that
same point you know drone scenario is
very similar to a car they're sensing
decision-making and then acting in fact
one of our core projects in terminal 1
will be a a quadcopter scenario product
called follow me feel free to check that
out on the site for more details but
again the skills you know we won't we're
not going to be targeting the specific
Matic case but again it's kind of the
general approach to a drone scenario so
yes we're definitely covering a UAV the
drones I've just seen one more question
here we can grab that came in online
Greg Helton asks says to me like many of
the graduates will become sales
engineers customizing and implementing
robotic just robot designs for the
of customers is that the case Sales
Engineers would certainly be one role
there I think the types of jobs that
will be available to a particular
graduate I think are going to be coming
from a combination of what that person
brought to the program as in you know
what kind of skills that they have
before this program and then which areas
they really excelled in or preferred
within the curriculum that we're
providing so there are there's not just
one job out there called robotics
engineer that is like the same thing in
different companies there are all kinds
of angles that includes sales and
include various development roles and
and so on
that that students depending on what
they took from the program and what they
brought into with their previous skill
set would open up a diverse range of
jobs and different for each individual I
think sure I'm just moving the
conversation not slightly and coming
back so they're at the broader topic and
when we're talking about things like
self-driving cars and drones and what
are some of the social challenges that
you guys are facing when you know when
working on this project
okay well I was gonna say like just like
for the case of self-driving cars as a
particular type of robot yeah you know
around Silicon Valley you see
self-driving cars everywhere and people
seem like they've kind of like Thomas we
were talking about this yesterday so
people seem like they're kind of
accepted the fact that these cars are
driving around autonomously in in our
midst but that making that getting
people to accept robots interacting in
their you know public space might be a
challenge in other places but go ahead
well in another respect in order for the
robots to operate if you need to collect
tons of sensor data so you know if you
have a robot around your house it has to
understand it has to have like a mental
perception of what your house is which
means it has to look around in the world
it's got to listen and there's always
the question what's you know what's
happening with that data that's that's
another social challenge or just
codifying the rules of the
Road for example if it's a car you're
moving around and you know you have to
make a decision between hitting two
objects you know how do you make that
decision that's a social question that's
not you know an engineering question I
would say yeah I think just getting
people to accept the technology is the
biggest barrier I mean if you look back
in history like when elevators were
first brought into buildings people
refused to use them they thought they
were gonna say I'm a but now I'm like
you could live without it then it'll be
the same thing you know ten minutes
after it's introduced and be like oh I
couldn't live without it I've always had
this everybody take a couple more I just
seen a couple more coming in online here
one person asks if I want to take both
robotics in self-driving cars their
preferred order not necessarily there
they're not neat neither one is a
prerequisite for the other they're both
there there is some overlapping content
but but whichever whichever you want to
take or take them simultaneously is fine
as long as you have enough time be sure
to have enough time Adam is asking me
exactly what deep learning techniques
will be used in robotics Andy we're
going to we're going to flesh that out a
little bit more in the curriculum but
but yeah you've mentioned CNN's and
reinforcement along those lines yeah
given that Ross has this is printf
Sharma asking given that Ross has
available leverage for robotics will
students implement algorithms like
slamming Ross and localisation from
scratch or use available libraries I
think there's an enemy a mix of both
basically will be implementing some
algorithms from scratch and also using
some of the tools of Russ yeah certainly
we're definitely an implement
localization from scratch you can you
can bet on it
all right hey please guys keep the
questions coming in online and yeah
we'll see you know any anything is a
anything that you want said ones ahead
we've got they've got a great team here
in place to take your questions
um and so you know maybe the guys guys
from electric movement there
any any particular projects that you're
working on at the moment or anything
that you're petite take started about in
the field of robotics that you can you
can share with us without giving away
too many secrets right now that's the
problem of Silicon Valley everything is
covered by non-disclosure agreements but
I mean we have certainly done big
projects for companies everyone has ever
you know I guarantee you know of and use
the product of daily basis we've worked
with them that's about as much as I can
say yeah I'm almost every project that
comes comes our way you know accepting
this one is one that we can talk about
you know so it's always a that's always
a tricky question but I guess we can say
like a lot of our you know prior
robotics work happens to be like mobile
bases so it's a particular area of
interest to us suffice to say join
robotics and you'll be entering the
world's really interesting products some
of which you've talked about some what
you get we've got a question here from
Anthony asking about you know we have
any scholarships for the program
unfortunately nothing to announce right
now Anthony we are looking at that front
so sorry that I can't answer that right
now but stay tuned please join our slack
community we'll be announcing any any
items with regardless of that in slack
as well as on our page so please stay
tuned what we're never look into the
into that yeah looks like Katie asked
she said did ml Indian and now doing a
ind as part of a cohort wondering if
both the self-paced and cohort loads
will be available for robotics it will
just be offering this in cohort
turn-based mode so it'll be more like
more structure than what you would have
experienced in ml and Yvette similar to
what you're doing in AI and D there's
another question by Alejandro saying
will there be advanced versions of this
program perhaps yeah this is going to be
covering a lot of the bases but not
necessarily diving in super deep on some
areas that that could go much deeper so
if if it turns out
there's just a huge demand for an
advanced program than poking on it yeah
definitely chime in and slacking let us
know what particular areas you're
interested in investing as well and we'd
love to hear what you mean by events as
well so yeah there's another question
from Klaus saying how can I combine data
science and robotics could I combine in
the data science course with the robotic
nurse
so there's I'm assuming you're asking
about the data analyst nanodegree
program and the robotics program
certainly you could do them both or you
could do the data size data and now
analysts first and then robotics the
they're not entirely mutually exclusive
so machine learning techniques that are
used for data science are the same types
of techniques you might use in a
robotics application so the two are
related and will be complimentary again
we um and Jay asks which Udacity courses
can you can you recommend to prepare for
the program well again there's kind of
three pivots that we've discussed that
are kind of core for success again
object-oriented programming we do have
our programming foundations course in
Python but I highly suggest that you
check out if you don't have a background
in Python as far as math goes we do have
some actually 90 testing courses though
we also recommend I suggest that you
check out you guys see that compost
robotics and click on our FAQ our FAQ
there's a section with resources with
links to either Udacity courses and
degrees nanodegrees as well as well as
some other links in areas that we might
not particularly have content on that
could help you prepare on all three of
those pivots math programming and
physics so definitely check out the
robotics facts for for those links just
to answer that but that they confirm
that you person and Ryan and the deep
learning foundations man degree program
provides automatic acceptance on the
robotics and a degree is that correct
that is correct so pressing the deep
link you can program it and you can
you automatically be eligible for a
moment in robotics question from Anthony
asking are you guys looking at electives
like the software and car program for
term two in general it's going to be one
program without different tracks that
you're able to choose the one between
the other but my my guess at least at
this point is that the the hardware
itself might lend itself to going in
different directions own it's not it's
not entirely defined at this point but
in general it's going to be turned to is
going to be one set of courses for for
all the students passing through the a
negative a get me I hear a Katy Volk hey
Katie how's it going says thank you and
she loves the level support that one
gets in our cohort in our cohorts well
thank you Katie hope that you feel that
way we love the long suiting gauge of
any community that happens in our cohort
model so yeah thank yous well there's a
question from pranaam again about deep
learning are the prerequisites like
neural networks back propagation so
we're not requiring that you have prior
knowledge of neural networks we'll be
introducing a sort of a general level
what's going on in a neural network but
definitely some background in that area
would be would be great if you're coming
in with some understanding of how
marelit how many one that were to work
then you'll be in a good position to to
do the project there yet again resources
like the deep learning end of your
program and machine learning will help
you wrap up in those spaces as well
alright so perhaps at this point it
might be a might be worth covering the
details around the application process
for the nanodegree and so what do
students have to do to apply when do
when do the when does the application
process close and and when will in Robin
stop yeah yeah so you can go to the web
page udacity.com
robotics to to find a link to the
application the application is fairly
short and sweet just some checkboxes and
then a place for you to talk a little
bit about your goals and what you what
you expect to get from the program and
that sort of thing and yeah well you
know we'll be listening to all those
submissions as they come in and we know
applications are closing right now on
April 17 and we'll be reviewing all your
submissions with notice to come around
on May 2nd right now yeah so so go ahead
and get your application submitted and
get them cute we left great I think that
was a question another coming online
question for us
Ross Lloyd I'm looking to use the
program to retain to retrain sorry after
a decade in the oil industry I have a
degree in mechanical engineering and
programming in Python experience with a
course be right for me well there's
going to be some some other things that
you're gonna be looking for as well like
one of our prerequisites that we have
listed is Linux experience so you're
going to need some of that physics from
your mechanical engineering program the
Python experience is definitely going to
be a good thing so it could be that this
is a good fit however turned to there's
going to be some C++ requirements so
that might be something that you have to
brush up on definitely take a trip
through the prerequisites and the
material meet posted and ask yourself
the question you know what am I am I
ready for this yeah but in general I
would say that sounds like a great
background for for having the necessary
skills coming in great what I mean
if there's no further questions coming
in online at this point maybe it's good
point it's fun to wrap up and one of
these any of you had any closing
thoughts or any any last kind of words
of wisdom for a
it's a huge team like booking well I
just want to say again that we're really
excited to to be putting this program
together at Udacity we're really excited
collaborating with electric movement we
have great hiring partners who are
excited to work with us as well
so we're looking forward to working with
all of you and feel free to I don't know
if we shared the slack public slack team
that we're all hanging out in these days
but it's robotics udacity.com that right
so if you just go there you can join the
slack channel and ask us any questions
that didn't get answered in this session
or post articles that you thought were
interesting or whatever just just hang
out and chat with the other applicants
we've got almost a thousand people in
that team right now and growing every
day yeah I mean you know just kind of
code that on that you know super excited
you know we've got a set of projects
that we think they're really powerful
for you but we'd love to kind of hear
from you what gets you excited about
robotics yeah I know one of the projects
that you're working on you know hop on
slack and tell us what inspires you
actually we do have one quick question
before we close Oliver asks how
future-proof is a career in robotics do
you think that machine learning will
replace the job of a roboticist you know
given ie
given a mass-produced set of sensors
actuators robots learned to do or make
themselves well I would definitely say
that being a roboticist is deeper than
just just the algorithms like robotics
why is at the intersection of many
different industries so you know there's
Hardware experience there's algorithms
experience and there's also like
electronics experience at the end of the
day there's you know it might be that
certain parts of like training the robot
what to do gets easier but that's always
going to be a task you know you know
when design didn't go away even though
designing websites became much easier as
a matter of fact it's more and more
active than ever yeah I have a feeling
that humans are going to be employed for
a long time work I would love to be be
able to retire now
I think we have a lot of a lot of time
to come well on that note and Brandon
it's almost really appreciate you
joining us thing thanks very much for
making the time for us today
and running Chris as well and for all of
you who are watching is that we will
make sure that in an follow up email
we'll get all the details to you
including the link to the application
process to teach those of the program
and also the slack community that has
been mentioned and Steve got all the
resources at hand that you need and all
the information that you might want a
head of a head of the program as
mentioned the application process is
closing on the 17th of April and so
you've got a about five or six days left
sewer applications in at this point
thanks everyone for joining and I hope
you all have a good evening
Thanks great to see all you guys on the
