comment about your goals as a parallel
algorithm designer with respect to work
and span one goal is to achieve a degree
of work that matches the best sequential
algorithm I called this goal one of
achieving work optimality now I want you
to harken back to the days of sequential
algorithm design you're just for sec now
for what you learned back then your Holy
Grail was to find a linear time or even
sub linear time sequential algorithm
this isn't always possible but it's a
good goal and since you want to be work
optimal that Grail is the same with
respect to work in the parallel case so
what's the holy grail for span so what
I'm going to do is I'm always going to
ask you to find algorithms with poly
logarithmic span so Polly logarithmic
means log n to some power so that might
be log and log squared in log cubed in
and so on so always remember this
principle of poly logarithmic span
that's what will mean when we say low
span so what's special about poly logs
well since log n grows asymptotically a
lot more slowly than in and since o of n
is our work goal then Polly logarithmic
span ensures that the average available
parallelism grows within now you'll
always have to use your judgment about
whether a given parallel algorithm has
good work in span but please use these
ideals as a guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
