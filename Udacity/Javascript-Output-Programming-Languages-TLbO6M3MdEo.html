a little contract with ourselves let's
assume that when we're interpreting
JavaScript and we come across to call to
write we'll just figure out what the
argument is that'll be some string and
will append it to a special JavaScript
space output variable that will store in
the global environment global because
you could call right from anywhere
everyone has to be able to see it so
here is our glorious JavaScript
interpreter or at least the parts of it
that you haven't already written we're
given the abstract syntax tree which
contains a list of JavaScript elements
the first thing we do is make a global
environment global environments have no
parent pointers this would be a parent
pointer but instead it's none and we're
going to start it out with the variable
JavaScript space output mapping to the
empty string then for every element in
the embedded JavaScript code we evaluate
that element you've already seen how to
do that in the global environment and
this might make changes to it over time
through calls to environment update at
the end of the day the string we return
is well we have the global environment
right here we get it's one element which
is this mapping and we get out the
current value of JavaScript output which
hopefully has changed so it's quiz time
you've seen our assumption and we've
written out the code for the JavaScript
interpreter at least at the top level
here I've written three sentences we
could rename JavaScript space output to
anything as long as we're consistent
JavaScript space output is a good choice
because it has a space in it and
JavaScript space output starts empty
mapping to the empty string to support 0
calls to write multiple multiple choice
check each one of these that's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
