the clients and the server's can be on
the same machine can be on different
nodes of a local area network and in the
spring system what they wanted to do was
this idea of extensibility they wanted
to carry it to saying the client and the
server should be impervious to where
they are in the entire network so the
interaction should be freed in other
words the client-server interaction
should be freed from the physical
location of the clients in the service
so for instance in this picture the
clients and the servers are in the same
machine
we've decided to replicate the servers
in order to increase the availability
and now we have several copies of the
servers and the clients are dynamically
routed to different servers for load
distribution and for those of you are
familiar with you know how services like
Google work today this is exactly what
happens in services that we use on an
everyday basis when we access Google our
client requests are being routed to
different servers and this is the same
sort of thing that is happening in the
spring system that once you replicate
the server you want the client request
to be routed to different servers
depending on the physical proximity of
the client of the servers as well as the
load that is currently being handled by
one server versus another another
variation of the same theme is where the
server is not replicated but the server
is cached for instance if it's a web
server then there could be a proxy for
the web web server that is cached and in
that case the client requests need not
go to the origin web server but it can
go to the cached copies that are
available and so here again this
decision of routing a client request to
a particular cached copy of the server
is dynamically taken now all of those
sounds like magic in terms of how this
client-server relationship is being
dynamically orchestrated whether they
are on the same machine or whether we
dynamically decide to replicate the
servers and decide to route the request
to different servers or we want to cache
the servers and route the client
requests to different
cached copies all of these are dynamic
decisions that are taken and how is it
done well that's the part that you're
going to see next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
