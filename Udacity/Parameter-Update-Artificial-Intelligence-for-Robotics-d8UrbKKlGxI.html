Bayes rule a prior and the measurement
probability and the prior has a mean of
mu and variance of Sigma square and the
measurement has a mean of mu and the
covariance of R square then the new mean
mu prime is the weighted sum of the old
means the MU is weighted by r square nu
is weighted by Sigma square normalized
by the sum of those weighting factors
and the new variance term I want to
write Sigma square prime here for the
new one after the update is given by
this equation over here so let's put
this into action we have a weighted mean
over here clearly the prior Gaussian has
a much higher uncertainty therefore
Sigma square is larger and that means
the new is weighted much much larger
than mu so the mean will be closer to
the new than the MU which means it will
be somewhere over here interestingly
enough the variance term is unaffected
by the actual means it just uses the
previous variances and comes up with a
new one that's even peak here so the
result model that might look like this
so this is the common situation for the
measurement update step where this is
the prior this is the measurement
probability and this is the posterior so
let's practice these equations with a
simple quiz so here are equations again
and suppose I use the following audience
these are Gaussian with equal variance
but different means they might look as
follows compute for me the new mean
after the update in the new Sigma square</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
