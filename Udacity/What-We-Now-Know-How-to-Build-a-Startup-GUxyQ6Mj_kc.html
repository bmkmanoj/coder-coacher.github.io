learned in entrepreneurship for the last
40 years so one of the interesting
questions is why are you here and I hope
you're here to find out what does it
take to go from an idea to a business
and for the last 20 years if you wanted
to know how to go from an idea to a
business the answer from educators and
investors was simply well go research
and then write a business plan and
you'll know everything possible to
actually start and run your business we
now know that advice was simply wrong
not kind of wrong but very wrong and we
now today know something we didn't know
before we now know the right way to
build startups and so this class is
about that right way but before we get
started let's see how we took the wrong
path and then see what we now know works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
