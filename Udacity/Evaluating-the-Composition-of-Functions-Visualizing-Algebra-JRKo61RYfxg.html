now let's try this thing called the
composition of functions the composition
of a function is when we use two or more
functions together the notation looks
like this f of G of X notice that this
symbol is not a multiplication sign it's
a small open circle that means the
composite of two functions it kind of
looks like fog but we really read this
as f of G of X to see what's happening
here let's look at some function
machines f of X will be a function that
triples a number and g of x will be a
function that adds five to a number so
we're going to start by finding the F of
G of 3 what this means is we want to
find the output of G of 3 and use that
as the input for f of X in other words
we'll get some output here for plugging
in 3 in the G then we'll take this
output and plug it into F to get a new
output so we know GF 3 we simply take 3
and plug it in for X so G of 3 would
equal 8 so now we just really want to
find the f of 8 we take the output of G
of 3 and plug that into F so letting X
equal 8 for this function will have 3
times 8 which equals 24 this is f of G
of 3 knowing this what do you think
would be f of g of 5 enter that number
