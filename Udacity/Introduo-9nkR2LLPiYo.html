your guide on this journey this course
will introduce you to the fundamental
ideas in computing and teach you to read
and write your own computer programs
we're going to do all that in the
context of building a web search engine
I'm guessing everyone here has at least
used a search engine before like Google
DuckDuckGo or even my personal favorite
Dave they find you type in what you're
looking for and voila
in literally a blink of an eye about a
tenth of a second backcomb their results
this may not be enough to make you wise
but it is pretty amazing a goal of this
class is to turn some of the magic of a
search engine into something a bit more
understandable
our biggest goal though is to learn
about computer science computer science
is about how to solve problems like
building a search engine by breaking
them into smaller pieces and then
precisely and mechanically describing a
sequence of steps that you can use to
solve each piece and those steps can be
executed by a computer for our search
engine the three main pieces are finding
data by crawling webpages building an
index to be able to respond quickly to
search queries and ranking pages so we
get the best result for a given query in
this course we won't get into everything
that you need to build a search engine
as powerful as Google but we will cover
the main ideas and learn a lot about
computer science along the way the first
three units will focus on building the
web crawler we'll talk more about that
soon units four and five will cover how
to respond to queries quickly and unit
six we'll get into how to rank results
and cover the method Google uses to rank
pages that made it so successful but
first let's talk about how to build a
web crawler that we're going to use to
get data for our search engine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
