the amount of users in each age group
it's not an order and it's hard to
compare immediately this problem is even
more noticeable on a different plot if
we try to create the same plot for users
in each income bracket we see a very
similar problem and here it's much worse
these first two bins are for a hundred
thousand and over a hundred fifty
thousand and this last bin is for people
who make under twenty thousand our eyes
tend to read pages from left to right so
this graph is pretty hard to interpret
or even better said it would be very
hard to make comparisons naturally with
our eye we have to always scan down at
the bottom to figure out what group are
in so let's order the factors in our age
range variable what I want you to do is
to look up the documentation for the
factor function or you can read through
the example that we've linked in the
instructor notes once you're ready try
to write the code in order to order the
levels of this variable and just as a
reminder the levels should take on these
values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
