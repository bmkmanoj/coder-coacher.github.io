scientist on the analytics team here at
Twitter I've been here about two and a
half years right now and I took you know
a somewhat long and windy path to
getting here I actually started out in
college studying Chemical Engineering
ended up going to do a PhD doing
computational fluid dynamics molecular
modeling and spent quite a while working
in academia doing computational research
I went from there I moved to San
Francisco several years back and I
initially started working in the
chemicals industry doing a lot of
molecular modeling and from there the
first big leap I would I made that I
would say brought me more to the data
science direction was moving to a
start-up in the healthcare space that
was doing a lot of data analysis risk
modeling around chronic disease and that
really was the opportunity or gave me
the opportunity to take a lot of my
mathematical background and apply it the
data driven problems after working in
that area for a few years I start to
look around in other fields with
interesting data challenges and that
brought me to move into social media and
Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
