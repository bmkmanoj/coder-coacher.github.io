assumptions and restrictions for
chi-squared tests just like with all
tests we have to make sure that we're
adhering to certain guidelines in order
to do this test first of all we have to
avoid dependent observations in the case
of the Loftus and Palmer study the car
crash won independence would be violated
if the participants contributed to data
in more than just one of these cells for
example if they were asked both how fast
were the cars going when they smashed
into each other and how fast were the
cars going when they hit each other in
other words these 16 participants are
totally different from all of these
other participants whose data is in the
other cells another thing we should do
is avoid small expected frequencies and
in general have a large number of
participants remember that our
chi-squared statistic is just based off
the sample we have a sample of
observations and corresponding expected
values if we were to use this
chi-squared statistic to make inferences
about the population that this sample is
from then the total number of
participants should be at least 20 and a
conservative rule of thumb specifies
that each expected cell frequency should
be at least 5 recall that in our
examples the observed and expected
values were the observed and expected
frequencies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
