your computer that I want to talk about
which is the hard drive this is what a
hard drive looks like and you can see
that this hard drive has one terabyte of
data if you turn it upside down you can
maybe get a little better sense of
what's going on here it's a little hard
to see and my wife drew the line at
opening the hard drive so I'm sorry I
can't show you inside it but inside here
there's a bunch of disks that are
spinning and the disks are storing data
in a magnetic way and there's a reed
head that can read data from the disk as
well as write new data from the disk so
this is a very slow way of storing data
compared to what we have in the DRAM but
it can store a lot more data with a lot
less cost so there are two important
properties that the hard drive has so I
see the hard drive is a lot bigger than
the DRAM stores a lot more memory this
was 2 gigabytes this is one terabyte so
that's 500 times as much memory and a
terabyte is close to a trillion bytes so
that's 8 times to the 40 bits which is
equivalent to eight point eight trillion
bits this is enough memory to store
about a quarter million songs the
latency for a hard drive is much worse
than the latency for the DRAM memory and
the reason for that if you think about
what you have to do to get data out of
the hard drive well you've got these
disks that are spinning in a physical
thing so you've got to wait till it
spins to the point in the read head
where you can read it if it's not in the
right place the read head also has to
move across the disk so you're moving
real physical things so that takes time
the latency for a hard drive is about
seven milliseconds and a millisecond is
one one thousandth of a second and
that's the average time the time varies
depending on where the data is so if you
have to wait for it spin all the way
around and move to the head that can
take a lot longer if you're lucky the
data is in the right place and it
doesn't take that long the costs of this
hard drive is about a hundred US dollars
so let's add the hard drive to our data
table so for the quiz it's up to you to
figure out the values for the hard drive
in the data table as a reminder
we said it was $100 us for a 1.0
terabyte hard drive so your goal is to
figure out the number of bits I've told
you the latency is seven milliseconds
that's Anila not a nano you should be
able to compute the latency distance and
the unit's to use for this are
kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
