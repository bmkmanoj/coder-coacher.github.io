pretty straightforward it looks as
though we simply have to push the fire
through the forest with a certain
velocity if the left curve is the
temperature distribution at time zero
after one time step h it will be shifted
to the right curve and the amount of
shift amounts to the time step times the
velocity as we are storing these values
in an array couldn't we simply shift
their position in the array the tricky
thing however is that the time step
times the velocity is really small we
would have to shift these entries by a
fraction of a step how would you do that
here comes a different approach I want
to get the new value the value on the
right curve at the position X 0 I get
that new value by looking it up on the
original curve step size times velocity
to the left from here and other trick is
to use the derivative of this function
let's write down what this new value is
the new value after one step time equals
the time step age at this position X 0
is approximately the old value T of 0 x0
and now we have to take care of the
difference between these two and we
estimated using the derivative so our
correction the length of that green line
will be step size times velocity this
length times the derivative the slope of
our tangent the derivative is the
partial derivative of temperature with
respect to X at time zero and position X
0 we have to be a bit careful about the
sign if the derivative is negative such
as in this case we have to go up which
means we need a minus sign in front so
that's the trick we use the spatial
derivative to accomplish this shift as
usual however as with all these methods
we have to be careful about not taking
two large steps this value the step size
in time times the velocity has to be
reasonably small in particular it should
be pretty much smaller than our grid
size Delta X the way to compute this
derivative is of course to use a central
difference formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
