the Trent's parent filters color affect
the color behind it in other words we
want to blend the two colors in blending
in computer graphics the original color
is called the destination and the color
of the transparent object we're looking
through is called the source color we'd
also like to control how much can be
seen through this filter in computer
graphics this control value is called
alpha here it represents our filters
opacity when alpha is 1 the filter is
fully opaque and does not let any light
through as this value decreases more of
the destination color becomes visible
here I'm just showing how the red is
affected the blue would show through
when alpha 0 our filter is entirely
transparent and has no effect a typical
way to blend these colors is by using
this equation here the color of the
source of our filter is multiplied by
the sources alpha this gives how much
the source will affect the final color
the larger alpha is the more the source
color affects the final color to
counterbalance this this same alpha is
subtracted from 1 and this value
determines how much the destination
color influences the result this type of
blend is called an over operator as it
gives the effect of putting one color
over another the Alpha of the source are
transparent filter can be any value from
0 to 1 if the value is 0 this equation
simply becomes C is equal to the
destination color since the source
filter is entirely transparent if the
value of alpha is 1 the source is Foley
opaque and hides whatever it's being
placed over the equation simplifies as
expected with the final color being the
same as the source color the Alpha value
blends between these two colors another
way to say it is that the equation
performs linear interpolation as one
colors influence increases the other
colors effect drops off in proportion
this idea of having a control value in
this case alpha that varies between 0 &amp;amp;
1
is commonly used in many areas of
computer graphics expect to see this
sort of equation elsewhere as you
explore the field the over operator is
useful for transparency however there
are many other blend modes available in
WebGL for example one blend mode is
called add
as it adds the source and destination
colors together in three.js the blend
mode used is specified with the
materials blending parameter here we see
the over equation in action by varying
the Alpha we fade the effect of the
transparent object on and off try it
