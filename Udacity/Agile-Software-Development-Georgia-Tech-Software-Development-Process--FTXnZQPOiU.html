can really lower that curve then there
are a few interesting consequences first
of all up from work becomes a liability
we pay for speculative work some of
which is likely to be wrong some of
which we are likely to have to undo and
if there is ambiguity and vulnerability
for example in requirements then it's
good to delay we don't want to plan for
something that might never happen to
invest resources in something then we
might have to throw away later on in
general if cost is flat it is cost
effective to delay all decisions until
the last possible moment and only pay
for what we use so to speak
in other words there is value in waiting
time answers questions and removes
uncertainty and we want to take
advantage of that this and other
considerations led to the birth of the
agile software development specifically
for those of you are interested in a
little bit of history in February 2001 a
group of software developers 17 of them
met to discuss lightweight development
methods and published the manifesto for
agile software development which
introduces and defines the concept of
agile software development or agile
methods in a nutshell agile methods aim
at flat cost and a decrease in
traditional overhead by following a set
of important principles a first
principle is to focus on the code rather
than the design to avoid unnecessary
changes another principle is to focus on
people value people over process and
make sure to reward people in addition
agile methods are all based on iterative
approaches to software development to
deliver working software quickly and to
be able to evolve it just as quickly
based on feedback and feedback can come
from many sources in particular it will
come from the customer you'll be
customer feedback and to be able to do
so agile methods in to involve the
customer throughout the development
process finally there are two more
principles I want to mention which are
cornerstones of agile methods the first
one is the expectation the requirements
will change and therefore we need to be
able to handle such changes we can't
count on the requirements to be still
and immutable and the last principle is
a mentality of simplicity simple design
simple code and so on but be careful
because simple does not mean inadequate
but rather as simple as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
