and first a quick mental exercise what
happens if two different paths reach the
same vertex at the same time so let's
consider this graph here we're going to
start at node s here and we're going to
set its depth to zero on the first
iteration of our algorithm then the
depth of a will be set to 1 and the
depth of B will be set to 1 but we know
in the next iteration of the algorithm
this edge and this edge will both try to
set C's depth is this a race condition
does the result depend on which thread
happens to run first well fortunately no
because the algorithm is structured to
always write only a single depth value
on any iteration so if two threads are
both trying to write to the same vertex
within a single iteration they'll always
both be writing the same depth in this
case they'll both be trying to write the
value 2 so it doesn't really matter who
goes first or second because the end
result the depth of C is going to be the
same second how do we know when we're
done so typically the way we're going to
write this code is as follows
we're gonna check a variable to see if
we're done and we're going to check that
variable on the host that variable is
going to be set on the device the kernel
needs to set that variable then we'll
copy it at the end of it of every
iteration to a host the host will check
if we're done if we're not done we're
gonna iterate again if we are done then
we'll fall through the loop and move on
to the next code so how do we actually
set this variable so in this case what
we're going to do is we're gonna first
initialize a device variable called done
to true the way we're going to
initialize it is we're gonna have a
variable on the host we know is true and
just copy it over to the device so it's
set as true at the beginning then we're
gonna run our iteration run this
particular kernel and if the kernel
knows that it's not done yet it will
take this done variable and set it to
false then whatever the state of the
done variable is we'll copy it back to
the host and so the host will then know
if we're complete or not and make a
decision accordingly so how are we gonna
actually do this on the GPU what's
inside the kernel so this is an
enhancement to the code that we just saw
on the previous slide what we're going
to do is every time we set any vertex
depth on the GPU
we also alongside set the global
variable done to false so it's
initialized to true if we make no
changes at all in this BFS code then
stay true and we'll be done but if we
make any changes at all then we'll set
that global variable to false then we'll
copy that false variable back to the
host and it will give us another
iteration note that more than one thread
can set done to false but that's fine it
doesn't matter in what order these
writes occurs since they're all going to
be the same value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
