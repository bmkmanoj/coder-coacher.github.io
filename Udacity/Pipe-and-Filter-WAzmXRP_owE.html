the system into independently executing
components called filters the filters
are connected together using a FIFO or
first in first out queue and these these
cues are called pipes so we have pipes
connecting together the filters each of
the filters is going to take a single
input which has become called the
standard input and it's going to produce
a single output which has now been
called the standard output the filters
share the assumptions that the inputs
and output consist of sequential files
containing the lines of ascii characters
can you think of a situation where you
have a pipeline of filter components
where it's non ASCII I mean I guess you
could have you could pipe together like
Linux processes that are binary output
yeah but be useful well okay in terms of
like a user interface you wouldn't be
seeing anything that might be useful
well it turns out that in doing image
processing okay you put various filters
along the way to to deal with the
processing of the images also in
situations where their sensor data and
you want to filter out noise of certain
kinds or select you know certain
frequency bands and so on it's binary
data but it's going through a filtering
process so this although this does work
in other situations it's most familiar
and most used in situations where
there's text files so as you've
indicated there's going to be filters
having to do with circularly shifting
and alphabetizing and reading things in
and and putting things out and one of
the essential elements of this
particular approach to solving things is
there's no common data storage elements
which is passing the solution along as
we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
