learning a central part of the machine
learning toolkit Facebook Baidu
Microsoft and Google are all using deep
learning in their products and pushing
the research forward it's easy to
understand why deep learning shines
wherever there is lots of data and
complex problems to solve and all these
companies are facing lots of complicated
problems like understanding what's in an
image to help you find it or translating
a document into another language that
you can speak in this class we'll
explore a continuum of complexity from
very simple models to very large ones
that you'll still be able to train on
minutes on your personal computer to do
very elaborate tasks like predicting the
meaning of words or classifying images
one of the nice things about deep
learning is that it's really a family of
techniques that adapts to all sorts of
data and all sorts of problems all using
a common infrastructure and a common
language to describe things when I began
working on machine learning I was doing
research on speech recognition whenever
I made someone working on computer
vision or natural language processing we
had very little in common to talk about
we use different acronyms different
techniques and collaboration was pretty
much impossible deep learning really
changed that the basic things that you
will learn in this class are applicable
to almost everything and will give you a
foundation that you can apply to many
many different fields you'll be part of
a fast-growing community of researchers
engineers and data scientists who share
a common very powerful set of tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
