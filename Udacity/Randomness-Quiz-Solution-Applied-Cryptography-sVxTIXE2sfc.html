refusing to answer the question which
would be a very correct way to answer
such a question the correct answer is
the third choice and there's some ways
to know which ones are not correct I'll
show you soon how each of these
sequences was generated well if you look
at the first one you see there's a
sequence of 0 1 1 0 1 1 that keeps
repeating anything with a repeated
pattern like that it's definitely not
random now the caveat is well certainly
if you generated a long enough random
sequence eventually it would contain
this pattern inside the other one that
is probably the trickiest one that when
humans generates random sequences they
look sort of like this the property that
this sequence has is there's never more
than 3 repetitions in a row and when
humans are asked to generate random
sequences well they usually don't have
long runs of repetition but in real
random sequences there are you can see
there's a sequence of 5 zeros here
there's a sequence of 4 ones there's
lots of repetition and this there's
never more than two in a row so this is
not random though there to look
potentially random you'd have to analyze
them a little more carefully this one
has more structure this one is actually
random and let me show you and I should
say this one is actually close to random
and let me show you how each of these
was generated here's how I generated
each of those sequences so the first
sequence was generated by generating a
sequence I'll show you what generates
sequence does next but for each position
in the sequence the procedure that
generates the output generates 0 if the
position is divisible by 3 otherwise it
generates 1 and we do that for the
length of the sequence which is defined
as 88 display bits turns a list of bits
into a string all this code will be
available linked from the course so that
is what generates the first sequence and
the code for generate sequences here it
just maps the function onto the range
from 0 to n minus 1 so for that length
we're seeing the output of the function
at every position
so that's the first one and clearly
non-random the second one is taking a
string converting into bits and
displaying those bits and the string is
this great quote from John von Neumann
and what the quote says is that anyone
who considers arithmetic or methods of
producing random digits is of course in
a state of sin but of course we do it
anyway so definitely that's not random
it's generated from a very specific
string if you knew the string and you
know what these procedures do you could
generate that sequence and the sequence
that it generates is the one that was
the second choice here looks sort of
random depending on how carefully you
look at the patterns but is definitely
not random because it comes from this
quote from John Funland
the third one is actually designed to be
random so we're using the random choice
method and that's provided in the PI
crypto library that I'm using to
generate random numbers and it claims to
generate fairly good cryptographic
random numbers so this third sequence at
least is generated in a way that is
designed to be random the fourth one is
generated using this procedure called
generate fake random which starts by
making random choices but is designed to
trick humans by not having repetitions
greater than two and I should change my
comment I had originally done it was
greater than three and that looks to
most humans very random and I know it
was a trick question but I thought it
would be a little too tricky with
including greater than three but this is
a good test for humans and one of the
experiments people sometimes do is ask
humans to come up with sequence of
random numbers that they think are
random from their own head and they come
up with sequence that are easily
recognizable as non random because they
don't like to have too much repetition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
