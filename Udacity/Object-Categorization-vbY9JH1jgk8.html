can think about what recognition is and
one of the two main distinctions were
talked about but it pays to point out
again is this difference between single
instance labeling okay so here's picture
of a car we say you know that's John's
car okay and so we want to be able to
find that particular thing versus we'd
like to be able to find all of these
things and say okay those are cars for
the most part we're gonna be worrying
about this problem the generic
categorization problem okay so object
categorization described a variety of
ways this was slide from Kristin and uh
Burt liebe and then I changed a little
bit generically it's kind of like this
given some number of training examples
training images of a category recognize
some upper unknown instances of that
category and assign the correct label
now you notice that I put down small in
parentheses you know right here it says
small these days not a lot of work is
done on the small number that is
typically we have lots of large examples
and there's a question about how methods
that go from taking large data could
then use small data to me that's a
slightly more interesting problem but
we'll leave the small as being sort of
optional at this point but the basic
idea is that I give you a set of these
things and some sort of labels and you
want to give me back the correct label
all right so one of the things we have
to do before we can even proceed so we
have to agree on a set of labels and
there's this fundamental problem that a
single object doesn't have a unique
label so here we have somebody's dog
apparently named Fito I don't know if
anybody names their dog Fido anymore so
you can say well this is Fido or you
could say this is a German Shepherd you
could say this is a dog you could say it
doesn't say you could say it's a mammal
you can say it's an animal you could say
it's a living thing although living
being is probably I don't know sir but
it is these things right so there's this
question is what categories are best for
visual identification or which ones do
we agree upon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
