mass and pulling it back against the
spring by distance Delta X I've told you
what the spring constant is here when I
release this mess it's going to go
across this frictionless blue area over
this rough surface where there is some
force of friction force equal to 1
Newton back towards this friction this
area up this curved ramp it's going to
travel up up up up up up up and back
down back over the area with friction
it's going to compress the spring and so
on this cycle repeat many times until
eventually well the mass will run out of
energy because every time the mass
travels over this area of friction well
it's going to lose some of its kinetic
energy it will lose all of its kinetic
energy will go to zero and the mass will
have stopped somewhere on here your task
is to tell me where so if we define some
coordinate X and this X goes from zero
at the beginning of this area with
friction all the way to well the length
is 0.8 so where is the mass and the
motion stops and as another interesting
thing to think about what's the maximum
height the mass ever reaches when it
launches off this ramp the point of this
question is to get you thinking and
talking about energy transitions and
what happens with friction there's no
solution video and I'm not even going to
have you answer the question here what I
want you to do is to see the thread in
the link below this video and go there
and talk about this question share your
answers talk about your approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
