comma 2 has an a value of 2 and a B
value of 4 nice thinking if you got DS
correct now the key is that y squared
comes first so this means our hyperbola
will open up and down remember too that
k is this value and h is this value h is
always with x + k is always with y so
our center is really at positive 4 and
positive 2 we take the opposite signs of
the terms in the parentheses to get the
value of a we just take the square root
of four since it's underneath the x
squared term the square root of 4 equals
2 and to get the value of B we take the
square root of sixteen which equals four
we start by graphing the ellipse the
ellipse is centered at four comma 2 so
we go four units right and two units up
vertically now we need to go a and B we
need to find the for the points on our
lips from the center we move two units
in the X direction and we move four
units in the Y direction to is 4a and
four is four be remember that a is
always associated with the x squared
term the square root of four here and B
is always associated with the y squared
term in this case the square root of
sixteen now we're ready to draw in our
dash rectangle and the two diagonals so
we can draw our hyperbola we need to
keep in mind that our ellipse is going
to open up and down since Y comes first
it's the positive term so we're going to
cut our lips and then flip these two
ends outward when we do that we get our
entire hyperbola now let's make sure
this whole picture makes sense our
hyperbola is centered at four comma 2
and then we moved to units horizontally
for a rectangle and four units
vertically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
