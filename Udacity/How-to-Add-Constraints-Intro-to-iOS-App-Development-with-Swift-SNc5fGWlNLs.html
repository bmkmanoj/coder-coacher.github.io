centreline a button vertically and
horizontally in an iPhone app and after
a bit of browsing I landed on this blog
which addressed the issue by the way a
link to this blog is also available in
the instructor notes there I learned
that on my storyboard there is this
super tiny button here at the bottom
called document outline let me just
quickly go ahead and Center my
storyboard one more time now I know that
there is a lot of new information here
on the document outline but for now I
only want you to focus on the things
we've added already things like the
record button and the view that it is
enclosed within now to Center this
button horizontally what I will do is
select the button and then I will hold
the control key down on my keyboard and
start dragging from the button in this
direction and let go and here I will
select the option that says Center
horizontally in container done to Center
vertically I will hold the control key
down on my keyboard one more time and
start dragging from my button in this
direction and then select Center
vertically in container there now what
we are doing here is adding something
called constraints
this is xcode's way of putting things at
a precise location on your phone you can
see here in the document outline that we
have added two constraints a center X
alignment and a Y alignment okay so I'm
going to go ahead and run my app and see
if it worked it says stop pitch-perfect
oh the simulator is already running so
I'll say stop and then it will restart
it aha
there's the record button this time in
the center of the phone now if for some
reason I want to delete these
constraints all I have to do is select
them and hit delete on my keyboard
they're gone let me stop the app and run
it one more time and we can see that the
record button is not aligned anymore so
I'm going to go back and add the
constraints but this time I will use
this tiny button here at the bottom
which says a line I will select the
button and then click on a line and say
horizontal center and container
and vertical centering container and
then I will add the two constraints
there let me stop the simulator and run
the app again and boom our button is in
the center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
