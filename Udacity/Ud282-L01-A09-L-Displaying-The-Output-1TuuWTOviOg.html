keep track of the number of passengers
now say we want the computer to show us
how many passengers are on the bus so
far we know it's stored inside this
variable called passengers here but how
do we tell the computer to show us its
value
remember that print line instruction
that we learned earlier that's exactly
what we need now
however this time we wanted to show us
the value inside that variable to do
that we should type in the word
passengers but without quotation marks
remember that quotation marks are used
when we want to display a message or the
word as it is but here we don't want it
to display the word passengers itself
instead we want to see the value stored
inside that variable so when we type in
something inside those parentheses here
without the quotation marks Java
automatically assumes that this is a
variable and starts looking for the
value stored inside that variable and
displays it because this is a print line
statement which means if we run this
program here we get this print output 6
which happens to be the value of our
variable passengers here let's trace
this program step by step and see why
the variable passengers ended up with 6
inside this time in here is declaring
this variable passengers of type integer
which is basically creating this empty
box that we can store integer variables
in it the second statement is
initializing it to 0 which is basically
adding the number 0 inside then the next
statement is updating the variable
passengers by adding 5 to its old value
its old value happen to be 0 so when we
add 5 to 0 and update it it becomes 5
and then the following statement here is
subtracting 3 from the old value which
is 5 and updating passengers to this
result of the subtraction so we subtract
3 from 5 making it 2 and passengers
becomes 2 and then finally this
statement here is subtracting 1 and
adding 5 to the old value of passengers
which is 2 now so when we subtract 1 it
becomes 1 and then we add five
passengers become 6 by
time will reach this final statement
here our variable passengers will have
six in it and when we print it out this
is the output that we get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
