into a list because we're gonna be
indexing into that I start out in the
start state nothing has happened no
points awarded and player number zero
that is player a is the player to move
then I'd repeat this loop tell me
everything I know about the current
state if the score of the player whose
turn it is is greater than the goal then
that player wins player zero or player
one a or b same if the other player is
greater than the goal then that player
wins and otherwise I pick out the
strategy function for the player to play
if P is zero then strategy zero is a if
P is 1 then strategies 1 is B apply that
strategy function to the state and if
it's hold then I apply the hold action
to the state to get a new state and
otherwise I'll you know assume that the
strategy function is legal and if it
doesn't return hold then it does return
roll I'll give it the benefit of the
doubt there and perform the roll action
on the state and on a random integer
from 1 to 6 inclusive and that'll give
me the new state and I continue until we
find a winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
