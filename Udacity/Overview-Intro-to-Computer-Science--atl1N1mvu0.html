class abstraction universality and
recursive definitions what I want to do
now is look at various things that we've
covered throughout the course and see
how they fit into these three main
themes in unit one we introduced the
concept of variables we can use a name
to refer to some value so that's
definitely a type of abstraction allowed
us to use the name X to refer to
different things it's helpful for
universality but by itself it doesn't
really provide us that and it's not
really a recursive definition although
we can define variables in terms of
other variables in unit 2 we introduce
procedures and a procedure is definitely
a kind of abstraction by making the
parameter to a procedure we can have
code that we write once that does many
different things and we can hide all
those details when we use the procedure
procedures also give us a form of
universality we can use the same
procedure to do many different things
and we can define procedures to do
everything as we've seen we didn't
really understand that yet in unit 2
though but it is enough to define every
possible computer program and we
certainly use procedures to make
recursive definitions and we've
certainly defined recursive procedures
not until unit six though and this gives
us a way to define a procedure to break
a problem down by seeing it in terms of
a smaller version of itself the main new
thing in unit 3 was lists this is a kind
of data abstraction you can use a list
without knowing the details of how
Python implements a list it's also can
be a recursive definition we have lists
that have elements that are other lists
so it certainly is useful for recursive
definitions and it's Universal in the
sense that we can put any element we
want in a list so in unit for the main
things we did were finish the search
index by providing a way to produce an
index of data this certainly involves a
lot of abstraction we found a way to
represent the data from the web pages in
an index and respond to queries the
other thing we talked about in unifor
was how networks work networks are all
about abstraction we want to find ways
to make requests where we're thinking
about what we're requesting as a web
page all the details of how we actually
do that are hidden and unless we need to
worry about that it's much better than
think about that abstractly has this is
sending a request for a web page in unit
5 the main new idea we introduced was
how to measure costs and that's a kind
of abstraction we want to measure costs
in terms of understanding how the cost
scales with the size of input rather
than the details of the cost it's also
related to universality understanding
the cost of a procedure depends on
having a fairly Universal model of
computing we want to understand how much
given algorithm costs without depending
on the details of how our particular
computer works and then we introduced a
hash table this was a kind of data
abstraction it was universal in the
sense that it could contain any kind of
element as its values and we didn't
define it recursively we could certainly
have hash tables containing other hash
tables and we have dictionaries of
dictionaries so this is also certainly
has aspects of recursive definitions in
place and finally in unit 6 the main big
idea was recursive procedures obviously
that fits in to our theme of recursive
definitions it also relates to
universality we showed how to make code
that runs forever or keeps on going as
long as it needs to without using a
while loop so that gives some support
for the idea that all we really need our
procedures if in a way to keep track of
things to be able to define every
computer program and we saw that any
program they were right as a recursive
procedure we could also write as a while
loop so if you've followed everything
that we've done in this class you really
learned an amazing amount and as you
learn more and more about computing
you'll see these three themes of
abstraction universality and recursive
definitions all over the place but
you've already seen them many many times
just in the units of this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
