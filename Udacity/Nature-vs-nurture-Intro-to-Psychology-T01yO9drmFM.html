change from the cradle to the grave
when psychology was a new science there
was a great debate this is called the
nature versus nurture debate some
psychologists believe that we were born
a blank slate or the Latin term tabla
rasa this means that our environment
completely dictates who we are
environment is everything with nurture
and then some psychologists believe that
it's nature or as they like to say the
world within the skin so on the nature
side it's everything that we're born
with like our genetics that determine
who we are however today we know that
who we are is a function of both nature
and nurture it's a really complex
interplay of these two things and we can
rarely separate the two when trying to
explain different aspects of development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
