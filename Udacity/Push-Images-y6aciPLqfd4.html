to not only build images but share them
with others to do that we'll need to
host our images on a remote container
image registry such as the docker hub
review the output of the docker images
command and notice the name of our
modest container by default all docking
images go to the docker hub which
assumed that you own that repository so
we're going to do is use our own
namespace which is our doctor username
so what we'll have to do is add our
username to our doctor image using the
duck or tag command from the help output
you can see that we take an existing
image tag combination and we add a user
name and a repository the repository
would be important if we were pushing to
a different repository other than the
default docker hub like GCR ork way that
I oh but since we're not we'll just add
a user name let's add the username using
the darker tag command now if we use the
document image command you can see we
have our tag from this output you can
see that the Kelsey Hightower monolith
image name has the same image ID as a
monolith image now we are ready to push
our container image to the docker hub
use the dock of push command to push our
image up to the docker hub so that
didn't work that's because we need to
log in before we can push to the
registry we can use the darker log in
command to do that now let's try to push
our docker image again it worked this
time and now we have a hosted image that
we can share with others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
