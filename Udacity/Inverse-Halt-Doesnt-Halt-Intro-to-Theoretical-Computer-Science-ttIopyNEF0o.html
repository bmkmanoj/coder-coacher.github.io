exactly opposite to the last quiz so if
inverse halt given and verse hold does
not stop then this means that halt run
on inverse halt and inverse hold did in
fact say yes because that is the only
way that inverse halt can go into an
infinite loop because we know that hole
is going to terminate this is a direct
consequence of assumption number two
here and there's no other way to go into
an infinite loop but again something
doesn't really seem quite right here
when we dig a little deeper so halt
running on inverse hold as the program
and inverse halt as the input says yes
that means the following inverse halt as
a program when given inverse halt as an
input since halt says yes will in fact
halt so again we have the same
contradiction year we said that inverse
halt running on inverse halt did not
stop or did not halt and what we find is
that the implication of this though is
that inverse hold when run on inverse
hold does indeed halt running the
program inverse hold on inverse hold
either must stop or it must not stop but
no matter which one of the two we assume
we always arrive at this contradiction
here then verse hold on inverse halt
stopping and not stopping at the same
time which just cannot be right and
having this contradiction here means
that something either in the proof has
gone wrong or that we made some
assumption along the way that cannot be
true so let's check them one by one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
