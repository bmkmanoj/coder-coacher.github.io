that one this is most likely an
autosomal inheritance pattern the answer
to number two is that the male is most
likely minus minus or homozygous
recessive and number three the answer is
yes in breeding is playing a role that
first cousins made it to produce the
affected offspring now why are these
answers the correct answers let's take
them one at a time the first one we have
autosomal inheritance pattern well how
do we rule out the other ones well we
know this can't be sex linked for two
reasons we know it's not widely if it
was why linked recessive then this
female shouldn't be affected because
right females don't have Y chromosomes
it's also not x-linked most likely not
only because males and females are
equally affected in this pedigree but
the better reason is because if this was
an affected female right here then she
could only pass an affected ex to her
son meaning that he would have to be
affected and he's not so we know it's
not sex lling we know it's not
maternally inherited because that means
an affected mother would have all
affected offspring and that's not what
we see here either so we know it's
autosomal what about the second one
genotype of the male indicated by the
arrow well we know he's affected but to
know is specifically here that he's
homozygous recessive we need to know
that this is a recessive not a dominant
trait and looking in the pedigree as a
whole we see that it fits the recessive
model better than dominant because the
trait skips generations right and
affected offspring have unaffected
parents so this is most likely to be
recessive so the affected individual
must be homozygous for the causative or
recessive allele and what about the
third answer or the the third question
yours inbreeding playing a role yes in
fact you can see here in the pedigree
that these children here the female here
in the female here they must have
inherited one recessive allele right
because the mother was affected and so
because they're unaffected we know they
must also have a an unaffected dominant
allele and they passed this on to their
offspring and these offspring these
children were actually first cousins if
they had not made it as first cousins if
this wasn't the same thing
amelie the likelihood of the child being
affected would be probably close to none
because mating outside of the family
would have been up much higher
likelihood that you wouldn't have had a
heterozygous and unaffected heterozygous
individual mating with another
unaffected heterozygous individual now
that we know the answers to these
questions let's go to the next video and
give you a chance to evaluate your
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
