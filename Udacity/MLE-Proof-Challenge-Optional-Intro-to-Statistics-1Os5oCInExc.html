derive this mathematically and it is
challenging if you don't like calculus
you can skip over it so feel free to
skip if you skip no one's ever gonna
know and I promise you the derivation is
not essential for using this formula
over here you can use it entirely
without understanding by it's correct
but if you stick with me you get a sense
of how statistics video works as a
scientific discipline so it's a glimpse
into the beauty of more advanced
statistics so last chance you're gonna
skip hey thanks for staying on so here's
my quiz and it looks complicated but let
me explain it to you
I've actually derive for you the desired
equation down here which is the maximum
likelihood estimator all the way from
the definition of the probability of the
data you might remember data is
comprised of X is where each X I is 1
for heads in 0 for tails and of course P
is a desired probability of heads I left
open the derivation however 9 steps by
these 9 bars of a turn in the box is
very soon and what you have to do is you
have to pick from the 13 choices over
here then once it fit best there's
always a unique answer and you can only
use each of the things on the right side
once so it'd be four things left 13
minus 9 that you've never used so for
example if you believe that the right
answer over here is PN then you're gonna
type 6 into the box over here and PN is
now used up you can't write 6 anywhere
else so good luck with this the way the
proof works is by first taking the
logarithm of this expression over here
this ends up over here then we set the
first derivative to zero so you have to
compute a first derivative and plug it
in here and then you have to instance
form it all the way until you achieve
the final result good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
