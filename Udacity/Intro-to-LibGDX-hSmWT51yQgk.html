engine an application framework that
makes making games so much easier it
provides a bunch of useful functionality
including great drawing api's sound an
asset handling user input management and
a ton of other features that make
writing a game superfast libgdx does one
better though games written for libgdx
can be deployed on Android iOS browsers
and anywhere else the Java runs like a
desktop computer so let's check out how
libgdx works up at the top of the stack
here here's your game and then here's
libgdx libgdx provides a bunch of
functionality related to calling into
your game when it's time to do stuff but
it also provides all of these libraries
for drawing sound storage networking a
bunch of other stuff so when your game
needs to draw something you call into
libgdx to ask it to go draw something
for you now whenever you call a library
to go do some drawing for you that
library doesn't actually do the drawing
itself it delegates that task to the
underlying hardware it's running on so
it neither talks to the video card
driver directly or it talks to some
other abstraction offered by the host
operating system so here's the trick
when libgdx receives a request to go
draw something it can go and dispatch
that command to an Android system it's
running on but it also knows how to tell
if it's running on iOS instead of
Android it will dispatch a different set
of drawing commands to iOS or libgdx has
an HTML back-end where when your game
requests some networking to be done
libgdx can tell aw I'm running as a web
app this time I'm gonna go do my
networking using a different set of
commands than I would if I was on
Android or iOS and libgdx has a
background that runs on desktop
computers as well so the API is that
your game uses look identical to you
regardless of whether your game is
running on android iOS as a web app or
on your desktop computer that means you
only need to write your game once and
libgdx will allow it to run anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
