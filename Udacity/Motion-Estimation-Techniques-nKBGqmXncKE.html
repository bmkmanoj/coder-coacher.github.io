then the next one oh and then the next
one oh and the next one too we're gonna
be talking about motion estimation
basically given a sequence tell me what
move tell me how it moved generally you
can say there are two different
approaches to this
the first approach involves feature
based methods now feature based methods
are just what you might think extract
some visual features like corners
textured areas oh yeah we know all about
that and track them across multiple
frames so that is find them from one
frame into the nether oh we know all
about that too and that will give you
what's called a sparse motion field that
is you you don't have the motion of all
the points you have a motion of a bunch
of points that we're good to track all
right but that works really well when
image motion is large so you move like
tens of pixels and you have a
significant change between frames the
other method of class of methods I'll
try to call direct or dense methods in
dense methods you're sort of directly
recovering the motion of every pixel of
each pixel from the the fancy word is
spatial temporal image brightness
variation so another way remember that
volume XY and T so you can think of
gradients you can think of flow within
that volume and what you're trying to do
is you're trying to recover that flow
based upon how the appearance changes
over time it gives you a very dense
motion field but it can be sensitive to
appearance change it this type of
analysis is suitable for a video where
you're getting samples very quickly so
things don't move very much in time and
in fact if things are somewhat smooth
and time and space I could say well from
one frame to a next I can talk about how
things are moving like say a first
derivative if you're worried that a
Taylor series expansion is in our future
today well maybe tomorrow yes okay but
the idea is that it's good for nice
dense smoothly moving things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
