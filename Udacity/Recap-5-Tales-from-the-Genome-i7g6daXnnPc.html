lesson and I hope it didn't overwhelm
you but you just made it through the
longest lesson in the course so
congratulations let's see if we can
summarize these concepts into seven main
points point one pedigrees are useful
diagrams that help us organize family
relationships and the inheritance
patterns of certain traits among these
family members point2 we learned about
three main inheritance patterns in this
lesson autosomal sex-linked and maternal
point three the allelic composition of
an individual represents their genotype
and together with the environment this
determines an individual's physical
makeup or phenotype point for recessive
alleles are masked by dominant alleles
point five if an individual has one copy
of a recessive allele then they're most
likely not going to be affected by that
trade but if an individual has one copy
of a dominant allele then they're most
likely going to be affected by that
trait point six every parent randomly
passes on one allele from every pair to
each child and this is called the law of
segregation and point seven meiosis is a
very specialized cell division that only
happens in the germ cells of your body
and this enhances genetic variability
during reproduction through the
processes of chromosome recombination
and independent assortment now what you
to prove to me that you actually learn
something in this lesson if you have the
time I want you to construct a pedigree
of your family and focus on any trait
that you're interested in documenting
then go to the forums and post a link to
your family pedigree and take a look at
your classmates and see if you notice
any fun inheritance patterns of other
traits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
