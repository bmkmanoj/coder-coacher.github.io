craft is basically is code that is going
to launch this command shell that we're
talking about and that kind of code is
called shell code so how do you write
shell code where some little bit of
expertise comes in so the shell code as
I said creates a shell which is going to
allow you to execute arbitrary commands
so any code program that we have that
hacker can ask that that particular code
be executed so let's talk a little bit
about how do you craft the shell code
say call you making to launch a shell
you can write that code in NC for
example it's a fairly short piece of
code you just using one of the calls and
then let's say you compile it into
assembler instructions so once you have
the assembly instructions
remember the shell code has to be
machine code because these are values
and then they had to be encoded properly
and things like that these are values
that you're going to store in memory
that's where your shell code is that's
where control is going to be transferred
so memory is going to store these binary
values that you have to essentially may
look like data but actually you know it
is really represents instructions or up
curves and if your program is instructed
to go execute from there then it is
going to be a program so you really have
to figure out what the instructions are
and what data those instructions are
going to use when they execute and
you're going to craft that as a set of
values that you load into this part of
memory and that's going to be based on
the instruction of codes that the
machine code as I said before but the
way you can do that is by writing the
code in in a high-level language
assembler translating that to machine
code and that's how you figure out what
is the shell code that you're going to
need so it shell code that we're gonna
play somewhere in memory this is how
you're going to get to it then I say we
know how to transfer control to it
because could modify the return address
when the function added it'll actually
go to this place where the shell code is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
