tell me individually what's more
important to you to find out from your
genome would you be more interested in
the ancestry information or the health
information that it could give you Jenny
why don't you tell us is there is there
one more than the other because
achondroplasia comes with a myriad of
medical complications I would be more
interested in the medical ok Kagura
I think it's medical I give medical
maybe 60 / 50 eighty eighty percent and
ancestry twenty okay i think it's
medical but it's really tough because i
also am very curious about the ancestry
particularly particularly being Jewish
and not being able to go back that far
with the relatives who came from Eastern
Europe not being able to know who these
people were is you know kind of if we
could find something out that would be
great me the ancestry is my you know the
first thing that makes me one of the
first kind of information I want and
then the medical would be something I
would keep checking long-term I guess
mine would would be the ancestry
although the medical is also important
to me but definitely the ancestry that
means the information can actually
change anything or is it just going to
inform you I I definitely think it has
the potential to change quite a bit I
mean reconnecting with my biological
parents is something experience that I
think even though I have my real parents
now that will always provide the support
regardless of me finding my biological
parents I think having that connection
that new individual my life will have a
profound impact on me as well as the
medical information like it has the
potential to have a profound impact what
about you Ryan you think it would change
how you act how you behave uh I don't
think so I think for me it's more of a
just learning about me and my personal
you know my personal genetics and also
my ancestry just more of a
no it's the curiosity mm-hmm um Carol
anxiety causing more eggs under your
lesson xiety causing more anxiety of not
knowing what's ahead of course we don't
know anyway but when there's some
prediction that there's a possibility
and understanding statistics and
percentages of possibilities that create
some anxiety but I can convince myself
that it's good to know and take action
so I'm pragmatic but at the same time it
does produce a certain amount of anxiety
for me Jenny I'm thinking about this
question from the perspective of my
average-sized parents and then 30 years
later from me when I was expecting a
child and so the two different things
I'm a mutation so I came out of from
nowhere you know unexpectedly with my
parents when they found out when the
diagnosis was confirmed I was 18 months
old and that allowed them to just get
right on track with little people of
America the national support group
finding the top orthopedic surgeons in
the area that sort of thing so I think
it was really helpful for them of course
I don't remember that I was 18 months
old as far as you know when I was
pregnant again it goes back to knowing
ahead of time what what was inside of me
and and what we had to prepare for was
was monumental</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
