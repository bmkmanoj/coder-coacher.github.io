of mechanism design and I'm going to
basically break it into two bits I'm
going to see if I can remind you of a
particular mechanism design that
somebody famous once used in a story
told in the Bible and then point out
that that's kind of ridiculous and then
we're going to come up with something
slightly better does that seem fair I'm
interested to see this sure it so this
is the story of King Solomon I drew King
Solomon to look remarkably like curly oh
fun I get to be king solomon to find
links i'm so you remember the story of
King Saul yeah he was wise okay okay
let's go with that so then tell me the
story of King Solomon and the two women
and the baby alright so once upon a time
King Solomon was you know hanging around
on his throne doing kingly things and he
would answer questions for the various
people in the country that he ruled
Judah maybe sure let's go with that and
but he was you know he had a was known
for being very wise so people would come
with him with very difficult problems so
one of the difficult problems was two
women came to him with a baby mm-hmm and
each of the woman claimed that the baby
was her baby yeah and they could not
come to any kind of agreement one of
them it was actually the baby the other
one was someone who really wanted a baby
couldn't have a baby and then took
someone else's baby and so this is not
the sort of thing you want to get wrong
giving somebody's baby to somebody who's
not their mom right so let's see so
there are two women we got it we got to
give them names because I'm having a
hard time keeping track so let's just
call them a and B a from Alice and B for
Bob Bob that makes perfect sense wait no
uh Beth Beth ok so Alison Beth and then
there's a baby and so Alice comes to
King Solomon says bet stole my baby and
then Beth comes to King Solomon says I
will stole my baby and then the baby
just goes ah cuz that's what babies do
this little curly hair thing oh yeah
that's cool and now King Solomon does
what so King Solomon checks whether the
baby is in named A or B and then can
actually trace the genetic roots of the
baby back to the appropriate mother no
that was a sort of CSI
what does the story claim happen oh yes
I'm sorry so King Solomon says all right
I've thought about this a lot and I've
decided that the only fair way of
dividing up the baby is by dividing up
the baby giving half to a and have to be
and so that was what he claims he's
going to do he calls for his royal sword
person to bring a sword and he gets
ready to cut the baby in half at which
point a oh I recognize that royal source
it it's a Jedi mm-hmm alright so the
Royal sword person says ok I will bring
you the Royal sword and sword and and
solvent gets crazy to cut the baby have
and suddenly woman a cries out no don't
do it you should be can have the baby
yes and so so B gets to keep the baby I
don't think this would ever know so then
then King Solomon says AHA I set this up
all along I never really was going to
kill the baby let's say and instead what
I wanted to find out is who really cared
for the baby this particular baby and
that would be the particular babies
actual mother so the thought was that
the mom would rather have the baby live
and be with a different mom then be
sliced in half which would probably
complicate the baby's life yeah actually
I think it would simplify the baby's
loud but okay I'm with you on that right
and then King Solomon could then
determine that in fact a was the mother
and yeah so the baby back up and gave
the baby to a and sent be to prison I
don't know maybe he had a baby with b4b
sake I don't know it's not really part
of the story in my head what at that
point hey Lisa the baby a's happy b is
disappointed but not so disappointed
because there's plenty of other babies
to steal right and then of course
there's the poor swordsman who didn't
even get to cut up a baby okay so this
is that's like this point i do or he
does sorry that he does look very very
disappointed very sad in fact there's a
single tier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
