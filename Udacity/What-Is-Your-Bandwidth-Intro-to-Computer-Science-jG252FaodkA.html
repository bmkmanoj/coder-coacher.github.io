measure the bandwidth that you're
getting over your internet connection
I'm going to show you one that's
provided by C net this is not
necessarily that accurate and it will
depend where you are but you can go to
the C net site internet speed test with
hyphens between internet speed and test
pick your location all though it's work
and it will try sending some messages to
figure out what your bandwidth is and
you can see that I'm getting 44,000
kilobits per second it says kbps here so
that's 44 megabits per second we can try
again see if we get the same result and
we tried the second time we got 31
megabits per second or 31 point 7 we can
try again and we get 62 so we can see
that it is varying each time we try it
and bandwidth does vary your sharing
connections on the network with other
people they may be doing different
things there are lots of reasons why the
bandwidth that you measure varies but if
you try this test you'll see what you
get and we're gonna have a quiz this is
more of a survey than a quiz but we're
curious to see what bandwidth you're
getting so try a bandwidth test and see
what the result is and the quiz will ask
you to report that to us so this isn't
really a quiz it's more of a survey but
the question is what is your bandwidth
and you can use one of the tools we
provided links to to figure out what
your bandwidth is and the boxes give you
a choice of ranges and if you can get
greater than 200 megabits per second
where you live I'm very jealous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
