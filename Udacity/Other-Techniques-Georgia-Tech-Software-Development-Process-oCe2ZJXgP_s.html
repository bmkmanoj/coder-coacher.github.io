mention some other techniques besides
the traditional ones that we just saw
that can be used for requirements
elicitation and these other techniques
can be divided in three main groups
there are collaborative techniques that
were created to support incremental
development of complex systems with
large diverse user populations an
example of such techniques which is
widely used and you might know is
brainstorming there are also social
approaches and these are approaches
techniques that exploit the social
sciences to better collect information
from the stakeholders and the
environment and among those I just wanna
mention ethnographic techniques which
are based on the idea of collecting
information on the participants by
observing them in their original
environment finally cognitive techniques
leverage cognitive science approaches to
discover expert knowledge for example
they can be used to understand
problem-solving methods and in case
you're interested in finding out more
about this and other techniques and
providing some references in the notes
for the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
