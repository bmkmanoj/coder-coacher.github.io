we're going to define a procedure so
we'll define a procedure is friend it
takes a single string as input we'll
call that the name that's the name of
the person we're gonna we're going to do
a test using an if statement will chest
if the first character of name is equal
to an uppercase D if it is that means
the person's a friend so we can return
true if it's not there not a friend we
don't need the else right we could just
have it return false I'm going to keep
things more symmetric by using an else
and if the name does not start with a D
we can return false so let's try that
with our example Dyan we get his friend
is true and when we try with Fred we get
the output false so this looks like what
we want this is actually a lot more code
than we need there's no reason we have
to actually have an if expression since
the test itself evaluates to a boolean
we could just return right away we could
return the result of the comparison
we're doing the equality test
if name index 0 the first character of
name is equal to D so this has the same
meaning much simpler thing sometimes
people think it's unnatural to write
expressions like this that when you have
test conditions you feel like you need
an if statement but it's not required
it's much simpler in this case to just
have the one line where we turn the
result of the quality test directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
