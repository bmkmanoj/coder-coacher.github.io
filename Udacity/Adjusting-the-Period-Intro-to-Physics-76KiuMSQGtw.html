something is could be replaced with
Omega squared check it out there's
something in this case is something that
multiplies our X is K over m so if I
know k and I know Omega I can get em but
I don't know my gyno period so why don't
I get omega from that period well in
this case the period is one second so
Meg it's just two pi okay well now I
know that Omega squared 2 pi squared is
equal to K over m 50 / m 1 i'll have to
do now is solve this equation for am and
when I do I find that I need a mass of
one point two seven kilograms so okay
this was a little tricky the takeaway I
want you to remember is that any time
you can write your force like this
acceleration equals negative something
times X well you're going to get simple
harmonic motion that's really incredible
not only that whatever this something is
that will be the square of your angular
frequency now that's really cool but
unfortunately all this stuff we've
learned about springs well Springs
weren't how they made the first clocks
or the first chronometer 'he's well
there was one day when our good friend
galileo while sitting in a church saw
something that blew his mind and would
forever change navigation let's talk to
cheered bucker again to see what Galileo
felt well it's a rumor or an anecdote of
how if you want to call it Galileo was
sitting in this church and sees the
candle ear swinging from left to right
and he checked with his pulse to see
every if it kept an accurate rate and
due to counting to those two he found
out that there was an equal line in
oscillation and I saw clinician in the
pendulum in the swinging of the candle
ears and that's how the pendulum started
