to appear in our grammar so one
possibility is s goes to EE which goes
to E I using rule 2 and rule for so this
string is definitely in the language of
our grammar I could also have picked
rule 2 followed by rule 3 and then
eventually this will boil down to eia
sigh anyway so this string is also in
the language of the grammar now we have
a I be well I can get the a and the B
from this rule one here but then if I
don't want to make more a's and b's i
have to use this rule to to get rid of
the s and that requires that i bring in
this e and there's no e in this string
so that's not looking good all right how
about this aabb I can get that by
looping around the first rule twice and
then e I yeah the string is in language
of the grammar over here I've got the a
and the B around it you'll note that
these a's and b's follow the same
balanced parentheses pattern we've been
doing a few times so the real question
is whether I I + can be generated from s
well we can get the e we can get the I
but if we use the + rule it has to have
an e on both sides so you know we really
need another I in here but we don't have
it so this string is not in language of
the grammar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
