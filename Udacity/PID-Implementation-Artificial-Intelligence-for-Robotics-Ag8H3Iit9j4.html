car and your normal steering mode leads
to the trajectory far away from the goal
then when I submit you do is you notice
over a long period of time you can't get
closer so you'll start steering more and
more the more time goes by to the right
to compensate this bias you adjust to
the bias and as a result when you drive
you will see the car this way to do so
we need a sustained situation of large
error so that's measured by the integral
or the sum of the crosstrack error over
time let's make a new controller where a
steering is proportional to the cross
stick arrow as before it's equally
proportional to the differential of the
crosstrack error but now it's also
proportional to what's called the
integral or the sum of all the cross leg
errors you ever observed and this term
is interesting if we have a constant
crosstrack error of say point eight and
the sampler increased by point eight for
each time unit and it become larger and
larger and larger and eventually it will
correct the robot's motion so this is
called a PID controller this is the P or
the proportional term the D or
differential term and the AI for
integral P I D so let's implement this
and the integrated crossing error is the
sum of all cross check errors you've
ever observed let's implement this in
our code I give you an integral factor
of zero point zero zero four and let's
not worry about pick those - each wisely
chosen as you'll see in a minute but
let's run our code and now modify your
code to also allow for this parameter
