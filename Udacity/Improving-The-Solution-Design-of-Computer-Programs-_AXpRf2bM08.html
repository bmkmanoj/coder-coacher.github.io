answer yes we got a path that leads to
the goal but we didn't get the fastest
path so let's see what went wrong we had
our start state and then we started
expanding that and moving out and that
defined our frontier and then we were
very careful about sorting the elements
on the frontier and then we pulled off
the very best the one with the least
cost and then expand it out from there
and let's say the cost of getting to the
end of this path was 14 this 115 this
116 so this is the lowest cost path we
expand that first and let's say one of
the steps cost five so that gets us to
this state with the cost of 19 and let's
say that is in fact a goal state so now
we just stop there we said we took off
the least cost path we expanded it we
found a goal we're done when we were
looking for the shortest path in terms
of the least number of steps that was
the right approach but when we're
looking for the least cost path that's
not the right approach because even
though be pulled off the cheapest path
here the one with the lowest cost here's
another path that has a higher cost but
if we expand that there might be a step
that only cost two so we get to this
state with cost 17 and that's also a
goal so we made a mistake we stopped
here when we got this result that was 19
when we really wanted this result that
was 17 and I think the problem was we
were prematurely acting we said just
because this was the fastest solution
here we went ahead and took one step
away from the fastest and accepted that
when that might not be the best answer
overall so how can we fix this one
possibility would be to exhaust the
frontier that is we've got a frontier
here even though we we find a solution
from the first element of the frontier
we keep going until we visit everybody
on the frontier and give everybody a
chance to find a better solution another
possibility is to give everybody one
more chance so once we found the first
solution now we say okay every
many on the frontier gets one more step
to see if they can find a solution and
the third possibility would be to test
later that is when we generate this
solution we don't check right here to
see if it is a solution rather we just
go ahead and throw this on to the
frontier and only check to see if it's a
solution when we pull the the next
element off of the frontier so making
the checks rather than when we generate
a new node and we're about to add them
do the text later once we pulled them
off the frontier now tell me which if
any of these will work to give us this
fastest solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
