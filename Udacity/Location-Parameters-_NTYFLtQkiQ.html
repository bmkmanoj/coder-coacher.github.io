you set these parameters to as they can
have a huge impact on battery life as we
saw with the priorities and coarseness
battery usage is impacted by which
sensors you activate however and maybe
with a bigger impact is the interval
that you use consider how often you
really want to read the sensors in this
case you can see we ping them once a
second which isn't too bad but do you
really need that level of accuracy what
would happen if you were more accurate
and pinging them a hundred times a
second
what would your app experience be like
if your ping them once every 10 minutes
instead these are the type of questions
that you need to consider for your users
when designing an app that uses location
services so for example an app for a
hockey coach might want very frequent
updates of players locations on the ice
during a game so the coach can plot that
data after the game to see the players
effectiveness conversely an app that
tells you if your kids are home yet
might only need to check the location
details a few times per hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
