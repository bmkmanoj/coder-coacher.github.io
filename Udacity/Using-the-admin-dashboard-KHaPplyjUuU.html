after you first get your tracking ID I'm
going to close this window just has some
information you can read it if you want
I'm going to close it so we're currently
in the admin tab and if you click this
button here this arrow left pointing
arrow it expands the admin dashboard for
you and you see up here these tabs tell
you which dashboard your ends currently
were in the admin dashboard so the
overall account is what's for dinner
and within that account we can have
multiple properties but right now we
only have this one property dinner app
so basically dinner app is our app so if
you click property settings this pretty
much takes you to the settings for the
property this is where you come if you
want to find your tracking code here
here you see your tracking ID you can
also go to tracking code down here this
is where you started out remember so
Google Analytics was originally designed
for websites before there ever were any
Android apps it's still a great tool for
tracking website data but it's become an
equally amazing tool for tracking mobile
app data too but there are still parts
of the analytics dashboard that haven't
yet let go of their origins as a tool
for websites the icon here dot J S is
taken from the web usage of analytics
websites use JavaScript code to talk to
analytics but for mobile apps of course
JavaScript code is not needed but don't
worry it's just an icon so to get back
to the overall admin dashboard you press
this button here the arrow I mean let's
take a look at the views section by
default you get a view called all mobile
app data which you guessed it tracks all
the data from your mobile app you can
add more views if you like and set up
filters but one view will serve us just
fine for now when you have some data to
view you can use the reporting tab here
to explore the ways that users are using
your app no users yet but that's not a
surprise because we haven't hooked the
app up to analytics yet to get back to
the admin dashboard go to the admin tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
