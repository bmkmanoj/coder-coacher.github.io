define the Minimum Viable Product or
sometimes called the MVP for short
the MVP basically is what product or
service you're building in your first
instance that's delivered to customers
and the MVP is not an alpha or beta it's
a big idea in the old days the product
development process would go from seed
funding to concept to a market
requirements document to an engineering
requirements document and blowout into
an entire waterfall development process
and part of those steps were alpha test
beta test and first customership and
you'd be shipping and telling customers
here's a buggy unfinished product why
don't you test it for me and then you'd
always argue with sales about whether
you should charge for it or not but the
MVP is actually quite different
the MVP says no no we're not suspecting
a version one o product that has aspect
18 pages long we're actually doing the
work outside the building first and
trying to understand what's the minimum
version of a version one oh not what
engineering or the founders thought but
what is it customers are going to tell
us they'll pay for our use now and while
it might be quote a beta product we
never use that word we actually tell
customers it's a Minimum Viable Product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
