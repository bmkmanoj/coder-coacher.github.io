like to test them the null hypothesis is
the basic hypothesis that something is
correct and unless proven wrong we
always believe the null hypothesis is
actually correct we trust the
manufacturer but we have sufficient
evidence there is very high likelihood
null hypothesis is wrong and the ordinal
deposit this was correct then we reject
the null hypothesis and we tell the
manufacturer please print the label on
the box because your number there isn't
quite correct so let's do it to recap we
have in our sample 11 yeses and four
knows and our null hypothesis equals P
equals zero point nine in our alternate
hypothesis is it doesn't work as well as
advertised so P smaller than zero point
nine this is already exactly the setup
you're going to study when we make
hypothesis tests if we look at the
sample then it's obvious this is
binomial which is the fancy word for
coin flips binary experiments with
fifteen different experiments and under
the null hypothesis a probability of 0.9
so obviously in this binomial
distribution they are about 16 different
outcomes from 0 to 15 the most likely is
13 14 is also pretty likely if the null
hypothesis is correct and then the
probability goes rapidly down the key is
assume that h0 is actually correct so
the probability is 0.9 then find what's
called a critical region under which 5
percent or less of the total probability
of this phenomena designs for
differently you will place a marker over
here that separates outcomes that
invalidate the apotheosis
and outcomes that validate the
hypothesis so that all the outcomes
together left of this marker collect in
totality at most the confidence level in
this case 5 percent so that if you find
an outcome that sits to the left of this
point you can say wow this outcome was
so insanely unlikely under the null
hypothesis I just don't buy it
if conversely the outcome is summer in
this green box then it isn't that
unlikely after all realize that each
 itself might have a slow like do it
but you don't care about the probability
of the outcome itself even the maximal
ideal outcome has a small probability in
this model all you care about is putting
a separator between an acceptance region
and what's called the critical region
and again the logic is the critical
region collects many possible outcomes
but in totality these probabilities
don't exceed the 5% so if the final
outcome is in the critical region you
can confidently say wow I'm really
surprised I don't buy that HCR is
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
