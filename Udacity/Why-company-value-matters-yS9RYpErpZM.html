estimate the value of that company that
generates one dollar per year in other
words that dollar bill machine before we
dig into that let's spin a moment
considering why does it matter how much
a company is worth this course is about
buying and selling stocks so we're going
to look at why company value matters
with regard to buying and selling stocks
of course we want to buy a stock when
the price is too low and we want to sell
it when it's too high in general the
value of a company goes up monotonically
in other words it is always increasing
over time let's assume for a moment this
is the true value of that company well
address in a little bit what true means
but let's assume for the moment that we
have some understanding of the
underlying real value of that company
now that true value is distinct and
different from the value estimated by
the market in other words what price the
stock market says it's worth so on one
particular day maybe the price is higher
than the true value on some other day
maybe it's lower and some other day it's
the same very many trading strategies
which is what this course is about focus
on identifying situations where the
current stock price is different from
the true value so in other words if the
stock price goes up a lot but we know
the actual company is only worth a
certain amount when it goes up high that
might be a selling opportunity in other
words if we see the price up here and we
know the true value of the company is
down here sell it and similarly if we
see the price really low compared to
what the company is worth that could
represent a buying opportunity there are
many many ways that we can estimate the
true value of a company we're going to
touch on a few of them in this lesson
one is intrinsic value this is based on
the value of the company
as estimated by future dividends in
other words companies pay many companies
not all pay each year or each quarter a
dividend so it's a cash payment if you
own a share of stock you get a certain
amount of dividend for instance for
Apple this year that's about $2 per year
so intrinsic value is based on if we own
one share of stock we're gonna get some
amount of dividends accumulated over all
of the future what's the value of the
company based on that
another is Book value which is based on
the assets that the company owns so in
other words we add up the value of all
the factories at they own and so on
finally is market cap this is based on
the value of the stock on the market and
how many shares are outstanding so in
other words this relates to what is the
market think the company's worth this
relates to what's the value of the sum
of the assets and this one relates to
well if I own a share of stock how much
money am I going to get over the future
and what's that worth over all the
future going forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
