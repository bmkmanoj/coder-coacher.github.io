audacity talks where we bring so there
was innovative people in Silicon Valley
into the data studio and ask student
questions today it's my pleasure to have
my dear friend colleague co-conspirator
and just amazing role model Astro teller
here in the studio with whom I work for
many years as many of you know astral
leads googles and alphabets x-division
he is captain of moon shots I think he
defined the word moonshot that since
Obama has adopted into his speech and
he's one of the most innovative and best
people I know on the planet Astra
welcome thanks for having me so fast and
I really looking forward to having this
chat with you I want to ask you some of
the questions of students are asking and
they have submitted them through our
website how do you pick engineers that
evoke an X do look for something in
these engineers there are certain things
that are triggers for us so if we're in
the middle of a conversation and you
worked at parked for two decades and
you're a mems expert and in the middle
of me interviewing you you mention
offhandedly that you built a helicopter
in your garage I already know before the
interview is done we're going to hire
you if there's just no question that
someone who has that deep technical
knowledge but fundamentally is a maker
who has a deep excitement about trying
to make hard interesting complex things
that's the kind of person who's going to
fit it x here's a question from alum
this is embarrassing for me because he's
younger than me but he's he's 38 he's
been out of work for four years yet an
unspectacular career before that how
would the millions of people like me
like Elm get a say in the future and
help to bring it about the world has no
obligation to include you and at the
same time the world has no reason to
exclude you and if you believe in
yourself I don't see any reason why you
can't get more involved over time by
doing things like training yourself up
you know if I were starting over from
the beginning right now I would find the
most exciting place I could find
and I would offer to do anything there I
actually think it's healthy to start
over I encourage people to start a new
career at least once a decade part of
the power of entrepreneurship is the
naivete that it comes from not knowing
all of the rules in your industry let me
run some technologies by you and you
just give a yes or no for the next 20
years living twice as long I think
that's got a better than twenty percent
chance but I'm worried that we're going
to solve the physical problem in
extending the life of our bodies without
extending the life of our mind I think
it's Phineas you have brain implants
specific brain implants that you read
your brain and program new stuff into
your brain without having to talk to
people and read books and so on yeah I
think it'll be more limited than people
imagine in a variety of ways it will be
at first a prosthetic for people who
have specific problems it will help
blind people to see again and that sort
of thing I think synthetic biology
happens not to be something that X is
working on right now but I predict that
20 30 years from now people are
programming cells and life more
generally in a way that looks a lot more
like engineering than it does like
science chemistry or biology Vivek you a
cancer no but we will have taken can so
over the last 30 or 40 years cancer has
been taken down several notches and I
think what we'll see over time is that
more and more cancers will move from the
death sentence category to the chronic
condition category with cosplay yeah
that's the case Sakura is yes I heard so
far what about great things would happen
20 is no surprises so here's one of the
ones that isn't a specific technology
but it's just a different way of
thinking about things that excites me a
lot that you could think of generally as
robotics but I would think of as
intelligent technology historically
people have thought about making things
strong or safe or useful in very
mechanical ways you make a car safe by
making it strong enough and crumbly in
the right way that even if it slams no
brick while the people inside will be
safe looking at the car for example it's
starting to make sense to people to
think about weight instead of having it
survived the smash into the brick wall
what if we made it smart enough that it
just never hit the brick wall and I
predict that a huge number of things in
our world will go through this
transformation share with me a thoughts
on a I good or bad at artificial
intelligence like all technology is a
lever for the human mind it is a way
that to amplify human agendas and I
don't think artificial intelligence has
shown any evidence of being different
than guns or hydrogen bombs or
electricity or the Internet in having
this fundamental characteristic that
they can be very positive we're very
negative and is it logically possible
that artificial intelligence could end
up being a net negative for Humanity
it's possible but I don't see any
evidence that it's at all likely to
happen especially when humanity has very
serious problems like global warming and
artificial intelligence stands a high
chance to make the world a better place
the fear that robots will somehow
enslave us because they want everything
for themselves probably doesn't make
sense for me because that's a classic
human thing that we're doing which is
projection I mean frankly I think we
should be more worried that artificial
intelligence will grow up to be smart
enough that it will notice that the
things in this world who have it really
good are the dogs and the cats they get
to lie around all day do nothing and
take care of us if you were artificial
intelligence and you were smote so smart
you could have anything would you really
want to do all the work or did you
basically pawn it off on us and lie
around the house all day I mean all this
isn't what why is no one worrying about
that and then
sir is because it's not fun to worry
about that so many students going to be
like you what can they take away today
put together differently what can you
give them as it as a last piece of
advice to unleash their potential live
without fear if you make choices based
on all the bad things that could happen
and spend your time thinking about what
you can lose you won't get most of what
you want and if you embrace life with
passion and without fear it won't always
go perfectly living without fear is a
fairly magical choice to make there will
be my recommendation I style of talking
to your love you as a human being and
that's great too heavy hey dude asset II
it's great that you spend the time with
our students talking with them and
that's fine it's super inspiring thank
you for having here Sebastian I'm a huge
fan of Udacity really appreciate what
you guys are doing for the world then
I'm happy to be able to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
