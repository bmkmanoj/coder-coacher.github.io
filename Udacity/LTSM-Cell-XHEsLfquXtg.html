multiplying the inputs either by zero
when the gate is closed or by one when
the gate is open that's all fine but
what does it have to do with neural
networks imagine that instead of having
binary decisions at each gates you had
continuous decisions for example instead
of yes/no gates at the input you take
the input and multiply it by a value
that's between 0 &amp;amp; 1 if it's exactly 0
no input comes in if it's exactly 1 you
write it entirely to memory anything in
between can be added partially to the
memory now that becomes very interesting
for us because if that multiplicative
factor is a continuous function that's
also differentiable that means we can
take derivatives of it and that also
means we can back propagate through it
that's exactly what an LST m is we take
this simple model of memory we replace
everything with continuous functions and
make that the new low machine that's at
the heart of a recurrent neural network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
