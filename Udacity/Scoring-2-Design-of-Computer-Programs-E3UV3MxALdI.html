if you aren't familiar with the rules
the letters score their value of the
number that's on them x whatever you
place them on if that's a double or
triple letter score so here I don't have
any double or triple letter scores so I
get the individual values of the letters
10 11 12 22 times the total word
multiplier and the pink squares are
double word score so that's double
multiplier so 22 times two is 44 points
for that then if next play goes here and
it has to connect now this was a double
word but I don't get any double because
I didn't actually place a new tile over
an existing double word so nothing's
doubled but I do get credit for the Z
even though I didn't place the Z I get
credit for that as 10 not as 20 as it
originally scored but as its face value
10 plus 1 this is triple one so that's
plus 3 plus 1 10 11 14 15 and then if
the next place a was here that would
just score three four or five I didn't
have any bonuses whatsoever this bonus
here doesn't count because I didn't play
over it if a bonus is already covered up
doesn't count anymore so this would just
be five one more scoring rule this is
the word on the board great play putting
the cue on a double letter and double
word as well this would score 21 to 34
times two is 48 an X play could be this
which simultaneously forms three words
no in this direction and then in and no
in this direction so for no we get
double letter is two plus one is three
four in we get just one plus one so
that's three plus two is five and four
no we get another three so that would be
a score of eight all together so here's
calculate score takes all these
variables that we need to specify the
play and I'm going to start out a total
of my word multiplier that is have I got
any double or triple letters and there
might be more than one of them if I had
a long word that matches up with some
existing letters on the board then I get
credit and I covered a double and a
triple letter then I'd get x 6 so I need
to keep track of that
and then Allison want to keep track of
the crossword totals so not the word I'm
playing but the other crosswords because
they are separate from this word
multiplier figure out where my starting
position is from that position figure
out the direction that I'm moving in
down or across what the Delta R figure
out what the other direction is so if
I'm moving in the cross direction and
want to know that the other direction is
the down direction and now just
enumerate the words so enumerate the
letters in the word and the position
within the word figure out the square on
the board and the bonus square the word
multiplier if the square was already
placed on the board so if it is a letter
and I've got a function for that I
should be defining this here so this is
a bad piece of code I should be calling
his letter of square rather than testing
directly since I decided to make that
more abstract so figure out the word
multiplier from the bonuses you only get
the bonus if the letter wasn't already
on the board figure out the letter
multiply or same thing increment my
points by the points from the letter x
the letter multiplier and now if the
square is an anchor and the anchor is
not one of these unrestricted anchors
then we want to look for the crosswords
so there is a crossword find it figure
out the crossword score and add that
into the total why do I have this
direction is not down here because i'm
going to do crosswords score is going to
recursively call calculate score and we
don't want it to recurse infinitely we
just want it to recurse once and explain
that a little bit more so note up here
with in horizontal plays recall and
calculate score so for the only place we
call calculate score is here and we're
calling it with the across the way we
get the down is because we transpose the
board and so for calculate score we know
we're going to be called with the across
direction the first time and then the
down direction the second time although
I guess I feel a little bit that that
assumption that were always going to be
called with across the first time its
kind of hardwired into that that makes
calculate score a little bit brittle
probably I should refactor this to to
stop the recursion in some other way but
I'm so close to the finish line now I
don't want to stop to clean things up I
want to get to the end now here's
crossword score figure out the position
we find the crossword that's a function
we already wrote and then we recursively
call
callate score</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
