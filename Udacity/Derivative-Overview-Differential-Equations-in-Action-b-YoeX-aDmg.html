of velocity which is more or less the
same as the concept of derivative which
could be called rate of change in
general terms if you are already
acquainted with that you may want to
skip to the quiz imagine this situation
that we have a high-speed train on the
track that is labeled from minus 100
kilometers to plus 100 kilometers so the
track is 200 kilometers long and this is
our timetable the train starts here at
minus 100 kilometers and drives at a
pretty high speeds till one and half an
hour rather start then it stops at this
position 50 kilometers it continues
somewhat slower for one hour till it
reaches that position at plus 100
kilometers then it immediately returns
to the position x equals zero four hours
after it started this is few will
mathematical view of the timetable of
the trains timetable let's rotate this
by 90 degrees to get something that's
more typical for physics so now I have
taken this diagram and rotated it by 90
degrees to come up with that diagram TX
is now points to the right and the
x-axis now points upward or we can
create a second diagram from that that
shows the velocity so here the train
advances at 100 kilometers power here
it's just 50 km/h year the train goes
backward with 100 km/h so maybe good
idea is to label this axis with plus 100
km/h and minus 100 kilometers power so
here we have a velocity of plus 100
kilometers power here too and then the
train stops which means we have a
velocity of 0 and here the train starts
again and makes 50 km/h i justjust half
as much as before and here we are going
back
could with 100 km/h as a speed so the
velocity is minus 100 kilometers power
this is what the velocity looks like so
if you're going forward it's positive if
you're going back foot it's negative so
what we see here is the velocity of the
Train depending on time that's nothing
but the rate of change of the position
which we call X by how much does
exchange if a certain amount of time
passes the rate of change would be the
ratio for instance this ratio 100
kilometers / 1 hour a velocity of 100
km/h and in this case the ratio would be
50 kilometers / 1 hour 50 km/h so what
we are drawing here is the rate of
change of the x position nothing but the
velocity and this is the very same as
the derivative the derivative tells us
the local rate of change here the
derivative is 100 km/h here it's zero
here it's 50 km/h and here it's negative
as we as the time advances the
exposition decreases a negative
derivative negative velocity negative
rate of change the stones of way of
writing that V of T the velocity
depending on T one way of writing it is
d X of T by DT or X prime of T or and
this is what the physicists are using X
dot of T I'm going to stick to that
notation whenever physicists want to
compute the rate of change with respect
to time they put a dot on top of that
variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
