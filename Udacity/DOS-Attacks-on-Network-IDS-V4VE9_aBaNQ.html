attacks to disrupt the network intrusion
detection process similar to denounce
service attacks on a network server such
as a web server an attacker can send a
lot of traffic to the IDS to process the
result is resource exhaustion's
for example in CPU memory and network
bandwidth in other words the network IDs
may not be able to analyze traffic and
such traffic may contain actual attacks
that is the attacker came first they now
service the ideas and then launched a
new attack another attack approach is to
abuse the reactive nature of intrusion
detection the intrusion detection
process is reactive because when the IDS
outputs an alert the security admin must
analyze the alert therefore the attacker
can send a lot of traffic they would
trigger the alerts for example by
crafting packets that on purpose contain
signatures of attacks the goal is to
overwhelm the response system and the
secured Emmons and then the attacker can
send the real attack traffic that even
if it triggers an alert the alert will
not be acted upon in time that is
because the security Emmons are so busy
analyzing alerts of fake attack the rear
attack is not analyzed and he was too
late</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
