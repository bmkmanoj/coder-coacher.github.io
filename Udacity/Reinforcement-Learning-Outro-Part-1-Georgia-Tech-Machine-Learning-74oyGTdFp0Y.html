doing fine thanks for asking how are you
doing I'm doing well I'm excited to be
kind of pulling the course together and
wrapping it up and putting it a box and
sending it out into the world yes me too
has actually been a fun so far
as we take this we are about halfway
through I would say the first iteration
of the course and Michael kindly agreed
to come down to Atlanta to talk to me
again so that we could mention a few of
the things that we didn't get a chance
to cover mmm in the class because we
basically just didn't have time it's not
that they weren't interesting but
because this was a survey kind of course
I want to make certain that you had the
basics and that from there you could go
off and learn things I really understand
why they're interesting so what we're
gonna do is just very quickly talk about
some of the things that are either
they're new and interesting now or
perhaps old that we just didn't have
time to cover although may still show up
on the final exam and plus I believe
that everyone now has a really good
background for being able to appreciate
these things right and I think that's
what's important member the the main
goal of course was to give people enough
of a breath and just enough depth so
that they could then go out in the world
and understand why something like deep
neural networks is interesting or
different or the same as the way we've
been thinking about these problems for
years so maybe that's a good one to
start with so maybe we just talked about
a couple of things that we didn't cover
so there's a two big things that are
popular right now or that a lot of
people would have heard of by disclose
buzzwords but in a good way just made up
stuff deep neural networks
okay that's sure I'm learning which i
think is that most people deep learning
sure am big data so those are two kind
of things that are out there right now
in 2014 that people talked about we
didn't really get a chance to mention
how would you describe them in 15
seconds mmm so big data is the issues
that come up when you actually have a
tremendous amount of data so more and
more now it's possible to attach sensors
to the world and get tremendous amount
of information either webpages or
biological data I've got a little thing
that measures my steps every day you
start to pull this data off over enough
people you get there's a tremendous
resource but also challenges in actually
extracting good information from it a
lot of those
and you know we talk about things like
the curse of dimensionality and having
to deal with exponential ality well when
you have big enough data the truth is
even linear can be slow quadratic is I
think so linear in the amount of data a
linear amount of data because you've got
so much data coming in and by the way
you'll never gonna be able to look at it
again
because by the time you look at the
first set of data another day is past
and you've got another several petabytes
of data that are coming in what's really
nice about big data which is worth
mentioning I think without going into
too much details yeah it's only been 15
seconds it was in 15 seconds yeah the
other three or four is that the data
because we have access to all this data
it's fundamentally changed the way
science works so it used to be people
talked about well experiments and theory
and I'm sure there was something else
about you know how science was done and
now it's something else the scientific
method no but I mean but now one of the
new pillars of Sciences which is finally
agreed upon by the psychic community is
computation the ability to do simulation
the ability to look at the data in order
to validate models in a way that we
couldn't do even 15 years ago and that's
really amazed it's one of the reasons
why my guess is most of the people who
are looking at this first heard about
machine learning it's one of the reasons
why it's so popular because it's
applicable to these big science problems
that we care about
okay what about a deep learning yeah so
so deep learning or deep neural Nets is
and I think in some ways it's a reboot
is that the word that we use now a
prequel no it's a reboot now I'm gonna
go with reboot ok neural nets so back in
the 80s there was this idea that you
could train up neural nets with things
like backprop but it was not so clear
that you could do better with multiple
layers than you could with just a single
layer even though we know that brains
are organized into into lots and lots of
layers so it kind of fell out of favor
for a while but it's back and I think
part of it is there's a there's a new
set of techniques that can be used to
organize the computation in a way that
you can actually get valuable
information signal coming through at
each of the different layers of the deep
neural net I think there's a bunch of
different tricks and one of the reasons
we didn't talk about them is we don't
really know them yeah
yes that was the no sorry and it would
take too long for us to learn them let
me teach you and take because we
understand them completely okay we have
deep neural Nets we do well maybe we
think we do I guess no I'm thinks we do
you might actually think we do
biological plausibility our Caroline
sure no let's go with that
okay so let's see what else haven't we
have we covered that would be how about
semi-supervised market ooh this is
something that I really wish we could
have gotten to the class and maybe in a
later iteration of this will find a way
don't work we can put it halfway between
supervised and unsupervised we could
stick it in unsupervised learning like
we did randomized optimization yeah kind
of flushes it out a little bit but
anyway the idea of 70 supervised
learning is really cool like it's a
slightly different problem it has
elements of both supervised and
unsupervised like what so so imagine for
example that you've got I don't know
tons of web pages that have on them
information about cities on Thursday and
you label them you say you know this web
page has information about this city and
this web page has information about this
city and you you know eventually you get
tired of doing that because labeling is
is human expensive yes so if you've got
you know a billion web pages and you
only have time to label a million of
them then there's still a factor of a
thousand yeah of pages that you have
information on them but there's no
labels and so I think in the early days
people thought well well since we don't
have labels there's no really valuable
information there the idea of
semi-supervised learning is that you can
actually extract using unsupervised
methods enough structure from the
unlabeled data that when combined with
the label data it's like having the
power of a lot more label data than you
actually started but yeah those are
really big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
