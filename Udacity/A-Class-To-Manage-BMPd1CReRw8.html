managed object model now on to the rest
of these it's important to remember that
these seven classes always work together
as a team call the core data stack as
such it's very useful to treat them as a
team as opposed to individuals we can
therefore keep the whole team in one
class oddly enough called core data
stack even though in our day-to-day we
will use this class without thinking too
much about what's inside it's worth
taking a look at the code to see what
makes it take note that this class is
pretty much what apple provides you with
so don't feel bad for using it as is
it's the boilerplate class from the
apple developer site on core data let's
start with the initializer its job is as
follows it reads a model file and this
is the extension of the model file once
it has been compiled by Xcode mom D then
it creates a sequel light store for it
inside the Documents folder and it will
call it model dot sequel line once it's
done it initializes a context and
connects all these necessary parts into
a persistent store coordinator the
coordinator will also perform migrations
that's something that will deal with
later and if everything goes okay we get
no errors we exit and we have all the
core data sack ready to work there are
several utility methods that are
available here so just drop all data
this will delete all the objects inside
of your sequel light store but it won't
delete the files so it just empties the
tables this is useful while you're
developing and we also have the safe
context method which builds on top of
the method save from the context in the
following way whenever you'd call safe
context it will first check there's any
changes that have to be saved and then
we'll save so this will make our stack a
little bit more performing there are
other features that we will need such as
migrating data models or implementing an
autosave we'll add them along
way when they become necessary let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
