we should think about it in an existing
market if you remember our discussion
about market type we have existing
markets weary segments markets we might
have be in a new market or for in a
country outside the United States we
might be cloning an existing business
model but if we're in an existing market
we've got to kind of think about
competition is there a monopoly is there
a duopoly an old awfully that is are
there dominant players that really kind
of shape the pricing in our market and
what we really want to understand is
what's their products what are their
cost of prices and what pricing will
make them feel the worst and more
importantly can we do strategies like
bracket them can we undercut them can we
niche or blue ocean strategy them and so
these are the things you want to think
about if there are dominant players in
an existing market you want to actually
have pricing as a strategy not just a
reaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
