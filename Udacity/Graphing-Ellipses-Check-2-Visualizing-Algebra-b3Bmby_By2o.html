zero the a value is 10 since we move 10
units and the x-direction left and right
and the B value is five since we moved
vertically from the center five units up
and five units down now if you're
stumped about what to do first remember
that we want this to equal one so we
should divide our equation through by
400 so we'll take our equation and
divide each term by 400 4 divides into
for leaving us with one x squared in the
numerator and 4 divides into 400 leaving
100 in the denominator for the second
term 16 divides into 16 one time and 16
divides into 425 times so we'll have 1 y
squared divided by 25 and finally on the
other side of the equal sign we'll have
one since 400 / 400 equals 1 now we're
looking at an equation that fits our
general form when the ellipse is
centered at the origin the centre is
zero zero since there's nothing next to
the X and nothing next to the y we
simply just have x squared + y squared
now the a value is the square root of
this number so the a value must be 10
and the B value is the square root of
this number so B must be positive 5 if
it helps you you can rewrite the
denominator so it's perfect squares this
easily lets you find the a value and the
B value so we took this equation and
we've changed it to look like something
else we've changed the equation to look
like this let's graph this one to make
sure they're identical so so far we have
our old blue ellipse just like from
before that represents this first
equation and you can see that I'm on it
since it's become bold since I've
clicked on it now if I take our equation
and I set it equal to 1 we have the same
exact ellipse we move 10 units in the X
direction left and right and five units
and the vertical direction up and down
and we can even write the equation in
this form with 100's 10 squared + 25 as
5 squared and if I set this equal to 1 I
get the same exact lip
these three equations are written in
different forms but they're all
equivalent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
