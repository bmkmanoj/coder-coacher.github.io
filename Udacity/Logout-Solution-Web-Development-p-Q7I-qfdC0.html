and if I reload this page we keep seeing
the same thing the last thing I asked
you to do is implement log out so this
URL when you go to it redirects you to
the signup page and if I were to go back
to the Welcome page and reload this it
redirects us to the signup page because
our cookies been deleted the way you log
somebody out is you delete their cookie
I didn't say that in the lecture
hopefully you managed to figure that out
let's go ahead and see that in action
again let's log in you can see we have a
cookie the user ID cookie equals five
that's the user ID four space in this
machine and if I go to logout and we go
look at our cookie again we can see that
the user ID is the user ID cookie it's
just blank there's user ID cookie
there's nothing in it so that's how
logout works let's look at the code for
this first thing we have is our logout
Handler so IMAP slash logout to the
logout handler when we look at the
logout handler you can see it calls self
that logout which is defined up on blog
Handler and then it redirects to signup
and so let's look at this logout
function here it is remember we are in
class blog handler where I put all this
kind of helpful generic stuff that other
handlers may use and I'll logout does is
it sets the cookie user ID to nothing so
instead of setting cookie equals value
we just set cookie equals nothing and we
keep the same path so we're we're
setting and overwriting the same cookie
I'm if we didn't have these path
variables here or this path parameter
here on the cookie we would actually
overwrite the well we might set the
cookie on slash login or slash sign up
the default URL where you're on and then
when you go to the Welcome page you
wouldn't be logged in so that would
cause problem so we make sure we set the
cookie on path slash and we delete the
cookie off of path slash and so that's
how logout works and if you got all that
you did a very good job that's one of
the more complicated things you do when
you're writing web apps is all this kind
of cookie and hashing and all of that
manipulation but it's also you can start
doing some really clever things and well
a lot of frameworks do a lot of this for
you I think it's really important to
understand how it works because you'll
often find yourself in a situation where
you need to you know hide some data in a
cookie maybe have a special special type
of hash that represents some piece of
information and that sort of thing you
know we do that on reddit all the time
for anti-cheating stuff
and knowing how this all fits together I
think is really important that's why I
made you made you do all of this good
job and we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
