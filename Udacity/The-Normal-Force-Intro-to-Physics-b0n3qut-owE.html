that this force of the ground pushing up
on the ball well it's always going to be
perpendicular to the ground this is some
sort of perpendicular force in fact
let's call it f n where n means normal
and normal is just another word for
perpendicular and before we move on I
want to point out something truly
beautiful here we just discovered a
force we discovered that force by having
real trust in our model F equals MA if
this is true and there really is a force
downwards there has to be must be a
corresponding force upwards and we call
that the normal force in fact we can
verify the existence of the normal force
something as simple as a scale like the
one you might find in your bathroom so
here you are some person your mass is M
and you're standing on a scale I don't
like this picture because people are
hard to draw let's simplify a bit here
you are standing on a scale again but
this time I've drawn you as a box no
offense I don't think you look like a
box but it's just easier and we can find
that drawing things this way will
actually make solving later problems
much easier well we know that gravity is
pulling you downwards with a strength mg
that mg by the way is what we
colloquially call your weight the scale
of course is pushing up with a normal
force now let's think how big is that
normal force is it bigger than mg equal
to mg or less than mg and remember the
total or net force on an object is equal
to its mass times the object's
acceleration choose the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
