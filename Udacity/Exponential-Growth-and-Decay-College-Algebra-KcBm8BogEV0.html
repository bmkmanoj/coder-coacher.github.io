exhibit exponential decay a must lie
between 0 and 1 not including either of
these numbers when a is in this interval
the value of the function is x a
fraction each time x increases making f
of X get smaller and smaller let's
experiment with this for a second here
we are back in from the old desmos and
I've typed in the general function that
we've been talking about f of X equals a
to the X I've made a into a number that
i can adjust by sliding this right here
right now a is set to 1 and as we
calculated before this is just a
horizontal line f of x equals 1 now
let's see what happens as I decrease a
you can see right away just when I let
it go below one we already have a
function showing exponential decay as I
continue to make it smaller the decay
gets more and more steep it's happening
more quickly that's going to continue to
happen until it gets too small when a
reaches zero we have that constant
function again except this time is that
f of X equals zero we can of course also
slide over into the exponential growth
area as well that would just mean we
need to increase a past one let's try
that here we are back in our exponential
decay and there we go we're growing just
above one we already see that new
pattern forming and the growth get
steeper and steeper as a increases since
we're going to be multiplying by more
and more each time x increases if I let
a get really big our graphs going to
increase at incredibly quick rate i
would encourage you to visit the
decimals website and play around with
this on your own it's really fun to see
how many different things you can do
with exponential functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
