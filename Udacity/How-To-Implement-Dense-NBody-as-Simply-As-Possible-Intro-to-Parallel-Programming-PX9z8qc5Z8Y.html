might implement this as simply as
possible and we're going to begin by
thinking about this computation as
working on an N by n matrix the N bodies
on the x axis here are the source of
each force and the N bodies on the y
axis here are the destination of each
force the source and destination objects
are the same objects of course this is
just how we're organizing the
computation so the matrix element at
position X comma Y represents the force
that source element X exerts on
destination element Y and what we want
to do is calculate the total amount of
force from all source objects on each
destination object this formulation of
the problem exhibits a lot of
parallelism each of the N squared forces
can be computed in parallel we just load
the parameters of the source and
destination thread to do one particular
computation and compute the force say
using gravitational attraction
this requires specifying parameters for
each object for gravity this would be
say the mass and the position X Y Z then
each object say object Y must add up all
in forces that act on it then we have to
calculate n reductions of in forces also
in parallel since we want to run this
computation on tens to hundreds of
thousands maybe even millions of
elements we can see that we have a lot
of parallelism to exploit in this case
the computation would be very
straightforward well now see that if we
run it in this way we would be making
poor use of our memory bandwidth so if
we assume that all of our n squared
force computations running in parallel
must go to global memory how many times
must we fetch each element as a function
of N</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
