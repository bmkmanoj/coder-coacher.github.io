parser and let's see what is good for so
here's an example of parsing URLs here's
an official specification from the w3
the world wide web consortium there's a
definition on their page it's not quite
in the right format that we used but it
was very easy to take their format and
translate it into our format I just sort
of went down their rules one by one some
of them you copied verbatim some of them
I had to fix up a little bit you can see
here's the whole specification of the
grammar it's 40 lines or so it's fairly
involved and verbose but it handles URLs
it would straightforward to go from the
specification that they had on their
website to one that could be parsed by
the simple parser we built now I have to
say that as I was doing this I didn't
get it all right the first time I made a
couple of typos that made my grammar not
work and i found this function very
useful so i wrote this function to
verify grammar and what it does is it
finds all the tokens that are on the
left hand side and on the right hand
side and then it shows them to me shows
me the non-terminals the things that are
on the left hand side it shows me the
terminals that are on the right hand
side but not on the left hand side those
should be the regular expressions it
shows me some suspects what's a suspect
so that's something that looks like it's
the name and should appear on the left
hand side so it's a alphanumeric
characters but doesn't if they've done
that it's probably because I spelled it
wrong in one place and tried to have the
same word used twice and spelled it
wrong in one place and then there are
the orphans those are the things that
appear on the left hand side but don't
appear on the right hand side so they're
useless they're defined but they are
called anywhere as I was writing this
grammar I would call this function and
say oops there's an error and I fixed it
and call the function again and say oops
there's another error and then I got it
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
