available to me gone back to the SK
learn documentation so this should look
kind of familiar we found this through
Google remember and I'm going to scroll
down a little bit until I find the
decision tree classifier that's being
documented here and I'm just going to
click on this link and this takes me to
the specific page that's about the
decision tree classifier and this this
box right here is what I'm looking for
this is going to tell me all of the
parameters that I have available to me
when I'm creating my classifier so I can
see that there's a whole lot that's
going on here that I could tune there's
something called the criterion there's a
splitter there's max depth there's
minimum number of samples in the split
minimum samples in the leaf and so on
and so on
so these are all things that I can try
tuning so let me pick one of these we're
going to look at the min sample split we
can see if by training the min sample
split maybe we can alleviate some of
that overfitting that we were seeing in
the example that I just showed you so
here's what min sample split does say I
have my decision tree start out with a
bunch of training examples then I start
to split them into smaller sub samples
at some point I have to figure out if
I'm going to keep splitting any further
so for example if I start out with a
hundred examples here then maybe I get
60 and 40 then maybe I get 40 and 20 and
then maybe this 20 turns into 15 and 5
and so on and so on so the question is
for each one of these bottom most sort
of layers in the tree whether I want to
keep splitting it if it seems like that
might be a good idea and that's what min
samples split governance is basically
whether I can keep splitting or not
whether there's enough samples that are
available to me to continue to split
further so the default number for min
samples split is two so all of these
nodes I can further split except for one
of them so my question for you is which
of these nodes
here are a few of your choices would I
not be allowed to split any further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
