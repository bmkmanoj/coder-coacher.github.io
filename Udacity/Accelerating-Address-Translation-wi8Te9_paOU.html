translation process like this the offset
from the virtual address simply gets
copied to the physical address and in
order to translate the virtual page
number we do a lookup in the page table
which is in memory to find the physical
page frame now you may be asking
yourself won't go into memory for the
page table every time we access a memory
address be slow in fact we'll have to go
multiple times for a hierarchical page
table well indeed it would be thankfully
the page tables themselves may end up in
our cache which can help considerably
but architects have also created a
special purpose cache for storing page
table entries called the table lookaside
buffer or TLB for short instead of going
through these slower traditional memory
mechanisms we're taking a special
shortcut where as the caches we talked
about earlier are usually indexed by
physical address the TLB is indexed by
virtual address after all it's job is to
translate virtual page numbers to
physical ones this is extra tricky
because one virtual page number may be
mapped to a physical address in one
process but it might be invalid in
another or map to a different location
there are two ways to handle this
problem some systems simply flush the
TLB on every contact switch that is
every time the address space switches
this is a main reason that contact
switches are considered so costly
alternatively the TLB can use an address
space identifier field in the table to
make sure that the translation in the
table is meant for use in the current
context as you point out too that the
kernel sometimes gets special treatment
in the TLB because the kernel addresses
are constant across processes there's no
need to flush them from the TLB on a
contact switch sometimes two part of the
TLB is reserved for kernel addresses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
