student at Berkeley and she's done a lot
of interesting work on computer security
so what do our students need to
understand about security so one of the
first projects I puts out which I
actually worked here with dr. Evans was
I use Facebook and I install and use
Facebook Applications many of you may be
familiar with them like the Washington
Post social reader and at the time I was
just curious you know what are these
doing for my data how are they getting
my data how do these things work and so
you know I decided to learn more about
how they work and from there let's a
basically what ended up becoming my
thesis topic in a ph.d program I'm still
interested in how to applications get
data and how do they use the data so
when developers are writing applications
that access users private information or
resources like the location of the
camera they need to keep in mind that
they need to a respect users privacy and
only use the resources that they need to
use and be they have to be careful to
build their applications in such a way
that they don't accidentally leak this
data to other applications so I
primarily focus on Android development
and security of Android applications so
one thing that's really important for an
Android application developer to know is
about the privacy and security of their
applications so when a user installs an
applications from the Android Market
they're showing things called
permissions which are small warnings
that tell the user about all of the
resources that the application gets
access to on their phone so for example
for this application I'm looking at the
application can get access to location
the Internet the list of contacts camera
etc so the user is warned before the
application installation is completed
that the application can do all of these
things so as a developer it's important
to only ask for access to resources that
your application really needs otherwise
you might unnecessary
a scare off users who might otherwise
want to install your application so one
of the projects we built was a tool that
analyzed a psych analysis tool that
analyzes the permission usage of android
applications so that it can warn so can
more developers if developers are
requesting more permissions than they
actually need for their applications to
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
