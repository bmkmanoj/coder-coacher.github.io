projection our interest is being able to
take a scene like this and capture it on
two different images and more be able to
then of course project the information
between those two images to be able to
reconstruct a panorama or mosaic so for
the capturing the scene imagine I have
the first viewpoint we'll call it
projection plane 1 and this showcases
the second projection plane again this
is the scene we're capturing so what we
are interested in is relating these two
images which have been taken from the
same camera and map a pixel that is in
this scene from both P 1 and P P 2 so it
basically means is we now need to cast a
ray through each pixel in P P 1 and draw
the pixel with the array intersects PP 2
so that means is this point here this is
a ray of light this is a point here in
PP 2 and of course this is the point P P
1 now in essence this is the kind of
stuff we learned we could do with things
like feature detection right the same
feature is visible in between them and
now we need to detect the same feature
and of course this implies that this ray
of light is now going through this so
rather than then make this into a 3d
projection problem we will think of it
as a 2d image warp from one image to the
other what that means is we're going to
take these two different projection
planes and think about what would be a
warp between these two images that will
allow us to align these two points even
though these cameras would have moved as
I move this you know to get the mosaic
or a panorama remember we're taking
multiple pictures of the same scene and
removing a camera a little bit
so while this ray of light is going
through the same thing these cameras are
these viewpoints shifted a little bit or
moved a little bit of course we want to
be able to do this without knowing whole
3d geometry of the scene because if you
were to make it into 3d projection it
would be a little bit more complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
