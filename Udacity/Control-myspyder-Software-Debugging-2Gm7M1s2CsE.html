return the command to be executed if
this were an interactive program that is
if we would run this in a console on our
own machine this is the command to be
used to we could interact with it this
is what you can use on your own machine
in order to get your debugger to work in
this web IDE however such an interactive
program does not work so we need to
simulate this so what we have here is I
have set up a list of predefined
commands to execute in here this would
be step step and quit and we're using
the method pop of zero to return the
first element of the command list and at
the same time also to remove the first
element from the commands list so the
command is now missing is quit so we
have to add this if we have a command
that starts with quit we call this exit
of zero we needed our debugger exits all
is set now initially we do not step
through the program but we have a
breakpoint in line nine and in line 14
we want to execute three commands step
step and quit what should happen is that
execution is normal until it reaches
line nine then we step through two more
lines and then we quit the program let's
see whether this actually works and
indeed it has worked exactly as we
wanted first we reach line 9 then we
step we reach line level then we step we
reach line in 13 and then we quit and
this is precisely the output we would
have expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
