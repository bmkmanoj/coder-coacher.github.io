that you can use to organize your
classes effectively it's called the
concept of coupling we'll say that a
class is coupled with another if it uses
the other class in fact bluej shows us
this relationship with these arrows that
you may have noticed before
in this example the car class is coupled
with a person class because the code of
the car class uses person objects but
the person class is not coupled with the
car class because the person object
actually knows nothing about cars let me
show you when you look at the code of
the person class you will see there are
no cars in sight but when you look at
the code for the car class there's a
person here and the person class is used
up here like I said the car class knows
about the person class but the person
class doesn't know about a car class
it's a good idea if not every class
knows about every other it makes it
easier to make changes for example if we
make a change in the car class the
person class doesn't here it never knew
the class in the first place one wants
to keep the coupling between classes as
low as possible let's see what are the
classes the car class might be coupled
with go ahead go through the code of the
car class and give me a list of all of
the classes that the car class uses just
put the names of the classes into this
