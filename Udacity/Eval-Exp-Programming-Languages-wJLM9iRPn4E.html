to get the value of the left child I'll
just call evaluate expression
recursively to get the value of the
right child I'll do the same but for the
right hand side of the abstract syntax
tree if the operator is plus I'll just
add them together returning the sum of
the left value in the right value
otherwise if the operator is minus I'll
just subtract them return the left value
minus the right value to some of you
this may seem a little weird I'm
defining plus in terms of plus in Python
that is in order to explain how
JavaScript works I'm saying well
JavaScript asked you to do some addition
why don't you just do it in Python but
remember that an interpreter is really
like a translator so it should not be
surprising if you're teaching someone
how to speak French and they ask you
what is a French word mean what's the
French word for big or how do I
interpret the French word chromed you
might tell them oh it's just like the
word big in the language that we speak
and this is that notion of their
Universal underlying concepts but we
just have slightly different syntax for
them in this particular case it looks a
little weird because the JavaScript and
the Python syntax for + are exactly the
same but you'll see slight differences
later remember that for example in
function declarations JavaScript and
Python do actually look different so it
should look very similar now because the
translation is very direct this is like
romance languages that share common
Latin roots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
