JavaScript and previously we had a
formal grammar for HTML but there's a
slight difference between the creative
work of making up the grammar thinking
of the right one designing your own
language making the new Esperanto and
checking utterances to see if they're
valid for example we really want to
accept expressions like one plus two
plus three but we really want to reject
random sequences of tokens like this one
plus plus plus close parentheses three
this makes us super sad it's not
immediately clear how you check to see
if an utterance is in a grammar we can
do it in our heads but how would we
write a computer program to do it
remember we're making a web browser and
we want to render as much of valid HTML
in JavaScript as we can but web
designers sometimes make errors and
we're going to need to know how to
detect that so this decision is it in my
formal language or is it not am i super
happy or am i super sad is something
that we're going to need our web browser
a computer program to do so we're going
to need some sort of automated technique
one approach and this approach is super
slow we're talking snail speed here
actually I think I may clean this doodle
is so good that I do not even need to
label it we all just know it's a snail
one approach would be to enumerate all
strings in the language of the grammar
and then just check to see if yours is
in there if it is you win if not your
string must have been invalid
unfortunately we mentioned earlier that
often a finite grammar has an infinite
number of strings so spending an
infinite amount of time to enumerate
them all is probably not feasible but
let's try it anyway
so we're gonna try this approach first
even though we have some intuition that
it's not gonna work out the reasons are
one it's instructive to see why we need
more complicated parsing techniques
later but also because it gives us a
chance to learn a little bit more about
Python and some cool programming
techniques that will help you in this
class and later on so here are my power
tools this is a hammer which I guess is
technically not a power tool but it's
possible for me to dry it and this is my
let's say circular saw could also be an
unhappy squid this one definitely needs
a label let's imagine circular saw so
I'm going to introduce you to a new type
of expression in Python lambda which is
another way of defining functions here
I've written Python code to make a
function add two of X which returns X
plus two you can put a Python function
like this all on one line as long as it
fits and if I write add two of two I
expect to get four out here I've written
something apparently completely
different I'm assigning to the variable
mystery the result of a lambda
expression so here the word lambda is
fixed it's a terminal and then you list
some number of arguments and then you
have a colon and then here you can put
any expression you like if I call
mystery 3 I'm going to get out of 5
because the interpretation of this is
that lambda has made a function that
takes X as as argument and returns X
plus 2 so we just take this 3 and we
substitute it in for X 3 plus 2 is 5 5
is what we get out so mystery and add 2
are in fact the same but now I can do
cute things like saying
pehle gets mystery and then if I write
pehle of 4 I'm going to get 6 so I can
make up functions with this lambda
expression and then assign them around
there was a Brazilian footballer one of
the best of all times lambda means make
me a function and it's very popular in a
paradigm of programming known as
functional programming functional
programming sometimes contrasts with
object-oriented programming and
imperative programming you'll get a
chance to learn about those in other
classes lambda means make me a function
a lot like death</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
