solving some problems we're going to do
the experiment ourselves we're going to
calculate as a class the circumference
of the earth and we're going to do this
by having every single student and
myself take some data and then we're
going to aggregate that data in the next
unit and come to some consensus about
what the circumference of the earth is
there will be errors and we'll talk
about that this will be a big data set
so we'll have to learn some new skills
about how to handle that but we'll
figure that all out in the next unit for
now we just need to collect the data so
in order to do this what you're going to
need is a string or a stick so for
example in the video you saw earlier I
used a string with a weight attached to
it because the string need to be
completely straight you could also use
the edge of a building as long as you
know it's vertical and you can measure
its height or anything else that's
straight and vertical you're going to
need a measuring device maybe a meter
stick or a tape measure or something
like that again the units aren't going
to matter because they cancel out when
we compute ratios next you're going to
need a sunny day and I understand this
could be tricky especially if you live
in a region where it's not so sunny out
once you have a sunny day you're going
to need to do this experiment as close
to solar noon on a flat surface as you
possibly can now what's solar noon solar
noon is when the Sun is highest in the
sky and it's not necessarily in fact it
generally doesn't occur at 12 o'clock so
there's a link below this video where
you can figure out what solar noon is in
your location and I hope this isn't too
much of an inconvenience for you but I
think this experiment can be done quite
quickly and I think it'll be really
interesting to see the data that the
class collects so I hope you participate
in this of course you don't have to
participate but it'd be great if you did
now once you have everything you need
it's solar noon your location you have a
sunny day and a flat surface you have
your measuring device and your stick or
string the procedure is basically what
you saw in the previous video make sure
the string / stick is vertical measure
the length of whatever object you're
using so in the case of the experiment I
did that was the string with the mass on
it next you want to measure the length
of the shadow and be sure to record both
of these and then you're going to enter
your data here now entering data
well what data do you need to enter
we're
be doing this experiment a little
different than Eratosthenes because I
don't want you to have to use a camel to
measure distances between nearby cities
so instead what we're going to do is
you're going to enter your object length
and just enter a number you don't need
to enter any units because like we said
they don't matter
shadow lengths enter that enter your
true latitude so this is the actual
latitude of where you do the experiment
and you can find this in a link below
next you're going to enter the month in
the day now why do we need to do that
think about that for a second well
ideally you're doing this experiment on
the summer solstice which occurs around
June 21st or 22nd that's the longest day
of the year in the northern hemisphere
unfortunately by the time this class
comes out it's going to be too late to
actually get the summer solstice but
it's still right in the middle of summer
for the Northern Hemisphere and it's
pretty close to the Solstice so we'll
just have to introduce a small
correction to the data and that's
something we'll talk about in the next
unit but to introduce that correction we
are going to need to know both the month
in which you collect the data so that
would be June or July and you can enter
June as the number six and July is the
number seven so the month will either be
six or seven and then you can enter the
day so if you do this on July 1st you
would enter 7 in the month field and 1
in the day field go ahead get your data
I am very excited to see what we come up
with as a class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
