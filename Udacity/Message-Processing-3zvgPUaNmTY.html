of a message to produce a hash value the
first step is padding so that the
message is a multiple of 1024 bits
because the message is going to be
processed block by block and each blog
has 1024 bits the padding bids are
appended to the last block of the
message first we leave the last 110 28
bits to store the length of the original
message that is the length before the
padding then for the space between the
original message in the last 110 to a
bit we add 1 and the number of zeroes
necessary to fill up the space and
that's how padding works after padding
then the message is processed one block
at a time again each blog has 1024 bits
the logic of purple our processing is
described in the next slide the result
of processing the current block is the
input to the processing of the next
block that is when processing the second
block the input includes not only the
second message block but also the output
of the processing of the first block and
for the first blog the input includes
the IV the IV is a 500 have bid varial
Hong coded in the algorithm again the
message is processed one block at a time
at each plot the input includes the
output of a processing of the previous
block and the result of the processing
of the last blog is the hash of the
entire message now let's take a look at
the pulsing of a message block the
processing involves 80 rounds the input
includes not only the current message
block but also the result of the
processing of the previous block and the
result of the processing of the current
block will be the input to the
processing of the next block the result
from the processing of the previous blog
is a 512-bit value and it is divided
into 8 64 bit values and they are ABCD
efg
eh again the processing involves 80
rounds at each round the inputs include
the result from the previous round some
constant K and some words derived from
the current message block the constants
here provide randomized values and the
purpose is to eliminate any
irregularities with the input data the
operations at each round include
circular shifts and primitive boolean
functions based on and or not and XOR
the output of the last round is added to
the input to the first round and the
result will be used in the processing of
the next message block</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
