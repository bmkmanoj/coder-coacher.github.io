to make software fail making software
fail is something that I feel very
strongly about but in a big picture it's
not necessarily failures that we're
interested but rather the fact that if
we can find failures in software and if
we can fix these failures then
eventually we're going to run out of
bugs and we'll have software that
actually works reliably now if we look
at testing software as a whole as a
large problem it's really kind of
daunting because we can look at
Microsoft's products and we can see that
Microsoft didn't manage to eliminate all
the bugs and their products and we can
look at Google services and we can see
that Google didn't manage to eliminate
all the bugs in their services and so we
might want to say to ourselves
how can we possibly get rid of all the
bugs in our own software but what turns
out to be the case is the testing
problem is not really this large
monolithic problem but rather can be
broken down into a lot of smaller
subproblems and by looking at those
subproblems we could apply known
techniques and things that people have
done before and we can sort of pattern
match on these problems and once we
become good at these smaller problems
then we can become much better testers
as a whole and this is what unit 1 is
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
