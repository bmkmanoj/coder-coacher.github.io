team as the de facto way of building and
developing a new emperor application
it's incredibly powerful and we'll be
using it to generate our ember app
create new template and component files
and maintain and update new routes you
can do a lot more than just these tasks
though so let's see what it can do
running ember help gives us a list of
subcommands with their own set of
options there's a lot to scroll through
but we can view just one command at a
time by using the help flag and passing
the name of the subcomm and i'm going to
clear the screen so that there's not all
this clutter then to see just the new
command run ember dash dash help new
ember new is the command will use to
create a new app notice that running
this command will create a new directory
I like to keep stuff I work on in a
projects directory so when I use ember
to create a new project it'll create the
apps folder in here let's create our app
a name is required so let's give it the
name you dasa meals this command does a
number of things it creates an ember
apps default file structure creates an
initial commit runs NPM install and runs
Bower install installing the
dependencies can take quite a while so
I'm just going to pause for a second
until it's finished installing
everything and it's finished let me
clear the screen again another thing
that ember CLI includes is a built-in
server we don't have to worry about
installing a server or dealing with some
third-party code this is really awesome
but the server needs to run inside of
our project so we need to move in there
running ember serve will start the
server we can view our appt at local
host port 4200 switching to the browser
shows us our ember app with some starter
content an entire development server in
just one command isn't that awesome
ember CLI is an amazing tool that's
always in development sometimes a bug
will pop up from time to time while
recording this video I ran into a bug
myself there's a story about it in the
instructor notes if you have any
problems with ember CLI check out the
projects issues on github to see if a
fix is already in the works or check the
forums to see if what you're running
into has already been solved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
