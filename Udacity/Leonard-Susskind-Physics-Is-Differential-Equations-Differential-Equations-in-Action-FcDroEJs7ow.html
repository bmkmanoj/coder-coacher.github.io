I'll just read a word for word because
this is coming straight from the
instructor of the course so first sight
current physics seems to be concerned
with sophisticated mathematics like
Ramon Ian's manifold self adjoint
operators path integrals over anti
commuting spaces but wouldn't it be fair
to say that most of this higher
mathematics in the end boils down to
differential equations even if we're
dealing with elementary particles or
with the entire universe it almost
always has to do with differential
equations yeah let me take back one
phrase almost it always has to do with
differential equations yes it may be
that other things other mathematical
things are more important than the
differential equations in this
particular area or that particular area
but it always has to do with
differential equations yes why is that
why isn't that differential equations
become there because what we're
interested in is how things vary you
know what physics is about is prediction
to basically to predict the future from
the present or the future from the past
and that means understanding how things
change and you not only want to
understand how they change with time but
you want to understand how they change
with space you will like for example you
want to predict the weather all right we
the theoretical physicists usually don't
predict the weather but they do predict
similar kinds of things how do you
predict the weather well the first thing
you have to know is called an initial
condition you have to know what the
weather is exactly Everywhere's
on the earth what does that mean that
means you need to know the pressure you
need to know the temperature whatever it
is you need to know the wind velocity
and these are all a bunch of things
which vary from place to place so the
first thing you have to input is the
conditions at a instant of time now you
want to know how to change how do they
change they change little by little
incremental changes from instant to
instant and the incremental changes at
one position depend on what's going on
in the region nearby that one
whenever you have that situation where
the change in something depends on
what's going on nearby that's a partial
differential equation that's a partial
so whenever you're in the business of
predicting how the world changes or how
some part of the world changes both with
respect to position and with respect to
time you're in the business of partial
differential equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
