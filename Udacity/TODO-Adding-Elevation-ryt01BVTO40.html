through material in the same elevation
which is something the spec frowns upon
what we'd like to do is something more
like this as you can see the app bar
gains in elevation casts a shadow when
the content slides under fortunately we
have a callback for when the
recyclerview is scrolling i just
realized there might be a small
percentage of you that would feel
intellectually compromised if you didn't
get to implement this effect this is
your chance to pause the video and
attempt to do it yourself before I show
you the answer okay last chance and here
goes here's how i did this inside of on
create view right after our parallax
stuff i check to see we have an app bar
if we have one that i start by setting
its elevation 20 I then added on scroll
listener here and whenever we scroll it
we check the vertical offset at the
recyclerview if it's zero then we know
we're not under scrolled and we set the
app bar elevation 0 otherwise we're
under scroll and we actually set it to
its target elevation which is something
that app bars do that's kind of cool and
with that we get this nice under
scrolling effect it's a little hard to
see on the tablet perhaps but there's
actually a little shadow there you can
see that's being cast it's a subtle
detail but once again I always say when
we're doing these final steps it's that
last ten percent that really makes an
enormous difference and sometimes it's
the last one percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
