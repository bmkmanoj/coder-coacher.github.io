a master resume let me tell you about
how it helped me during my own job
search as I happened to be a person with
many different interests I have worked
in many different fields and positions
from media to epidemics publishing
nonprofits technology startups and as a
performer before moving to the US I had
over 14 years of professional experience
under my belt many of these experiences
are very interesting to talk about like
being a producer for daily talk show
with lots and lots of paternity testing
but completely irrelevant to career I
wanted to pursue and a new continent
right before i started at Udacity I
worked for a cultural institution of the
federal republic of germany who wanted
to have all dates and names of everyone
that ever worked with and every training
I've ever taken it's rare that anyone
besides the government will want to know
this much about you in fact a guiding
rule of thumb Menace lesson is to keep
resumes to one page of it all possible
but what I submitted to this institution
wasn't a normal resume it's what I later
called my master resume a seven-page
tome of all of my experiences what was
really helpful is that as long as I kept
my master resume up-to-date I could use
it as a data source to populate any kind
of one-page resume i wanted to write and
as a project manager i often needed to
tweak my resumes depending on the job
for example when applying to Udacity i
was able to pull all of my educational
experience as well as my experiences
managing projects of international scale
and technology companies it's that kind
of targeting that gets you the interview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
