subjective because since all of these
problems here are np-complete you could
basically try and NP completeness
reduction from any one of those but we
were looking for similarities so
bioinformatics comparing DNA sequences
yes that is a lot like common
subsequence especially if those
sequences have certain insertions and
deletions in them scheduling computer
programs that is most often a problem
related to packing so you have a number
of programs and a number of machines and
you need to match programs to machines
as best as you can that is almost the
same as putting packages into containers
and so that they are optimally filled
actually scheduling is almost an
individual class of NP complete problems
so if you look at the Wikipedia page
that we just looked at you should find a
couple of problems in a section
scheduling RK classrooms enough that can
be stated as a coloring problem so if
you have a number of courses and for
some reasons these courses cannot be
held in the same room then determining a
minimum number of rooms can be the same
as determining a coloring in that
Network so for this course here we are
using the red classroom then for this
room here we're using the blue classroom
and for example if you wanted to use the
blue classroom for this course here as
well that doesn't work because we have a
connection here so we have to use
another one here and of course another
one here that doesn't work as well so
for classrooms merging the source code
that two programmers have been working
on that is a common subsequence problem
because the programmers will have
modified certain parts that will have
deleted certain parts possibly inserted
other parts so we need to find out what
the two programming code still have in
common filling vans yeah that was an
easy one probably that is a classical
packing problem because you're actually
using packets something else always
calls for the Universal weapon and that
Universal weapon in the case of
np-completeness is three set so now you
have a library of one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten and P
complete problems which are a good basis
for showing NP completeness whenever you
come across a problem where you think
that it might be np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
