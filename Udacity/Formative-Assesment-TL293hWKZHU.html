education you probably think of what we
call summative assessments these are
things like tests and quizzes that occur
at the end of some learning process to
see whether or not you learn the
material by some deadline and you take
the assessment you find out if you
passed or failed and you move forward
either way but wouldn't it be great to
find out while you're learning if you're
learning the material well enough that's
where formative assessment comes in
formative assessment is assessment while
you're learning some new material it's
really powerful because it more
authentically mimics the way we learn in
the real world when you're learning to
walk or talk what you're really doing is
trying lots of things every single
minute and getting immediate feedback on
whether or not you did it correctly
that's formative assessment its
assessment while you're trying to learn
something so formative assessment is
very powerful and I would say it's
universally a good idea
the difficulty is it's very difficult to
do in a regular classroom when you have
one teacher in 20 or 30 students how do
you have that one teacher give all those
students individual feedback on what
they're doing wrong all at the same time
it just can't be done and at college
classroom is even more difficult you
have one professor and two hundred of
300 students how can they give 200
students feedback all at the same time
it's just not possible that's why we
talk about this in an educational
technology class educational technology
can help us with that
educational technology can develop tools
that give students individual feedback
on what they're doing while they're
doing it we use artificial intelligence
to give every single student some
individualized feedback on what they did
wrong on that latest iteration all at
the same time even if everyone is doing
something different so that's why we
talk about in this class so in this
lesson we'll talk about what formative
assessment is why it's powerful and how
we can develop educational technologies
that help facilitate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
