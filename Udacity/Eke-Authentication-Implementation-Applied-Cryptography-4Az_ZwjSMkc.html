parties obtain the same key for the
server to obtain the key and needed to
be able to decrypt this message using
the password and so what we're going to
add to the message is instead of just
sending this value we're going to also
send a challenge and that challenge is
going to be encrypted using the key and
the challenges are some random value
selected by the server and now Alice
needs to be able to obtain the right key
that proves that she knew the password
and using that key while she can decrypt
this message and obtain R this
effectively demonstrates to Alice that
she's talking to the right server at
least a server that knew her password
because the key that's produced here
could only be produced correctly if the
server was able to decrypt the message
that Alice sent encrypted with that
password this hasn't yet proven anything
to the server so to finish the protocol
Alice has to send a response back to the
server that proves that she was able to
obtain R so Alice could do this by
proving that she learned R so she could
send the message encrypting with the key
R back to the server so does this work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
