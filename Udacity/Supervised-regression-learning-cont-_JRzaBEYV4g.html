supervised machine learning from my
robotics past this robot you see here is
called lager or learning applied to
ground robotics it is using K nearest
neighbor to learn how to navigate let me
talk a little bit about what comes in
and what goes out it has a sensor in
front of it that sees the world in front
of it it can see along a number of
directions where there are obstacles or
where the road is clear so the input is
in which directions are their obstacles
and also it has a direction towards the
goal so in this case the robots trying
to get to a goal that's off the left but
these bushes that line the path are sort
of preventing it from getting there so X
in our case are these perceptions what
do I see around me and what's the
direction to the goal and Y or the
output is which direction to steer so
let's let it go for a while and see how
well it can navigate based on a little
bit of training that it's been given
it's doing pretty good here so far but
it hasn't been trained quite well enough
and boom it goes off the path this is
where learning comes in we back it up
over that area where it messed up and we
switch the learning switch on and we're
essentially telling it okay watch what
we do that's the correct thing to do in
this case so it takes all those examples
of X's and Y's X's being the perception
and Y being the way it should respond
adds that to its memory and now when
it's running alive it consults its
memory it says oh I see this what should
I do it finds the K nearest neighbors to
that current observation and looks at
what they say and those are they
essentially vote on which direction the
robot should go now after we've trained
it for about a half hour so it's able to
navigate through
difficult scenarios really quite easily
so keep in mind this robots is driving
autonomously
it's just consulting its memory for when
I saw this what was the right answer
why supervised learning and it's able to
get around quite well here's another
more complicated scenario the goal where
it's trying to get is on the other side
of that tree
so that's supervised learning for robot
and again the model maps these
perceptions X to Y what it should do and
in finance instead of Y being which way
the robot should go it's often a
prediction about what a future price is
okay enough about robots let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
