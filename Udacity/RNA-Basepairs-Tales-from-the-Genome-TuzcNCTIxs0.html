that distinguish it from DNA the first
is that RNA uses a different nitrogenous
base attached to its nucleotides called
uracil or u instead of thymine T the
second distinguishing feature is that
RNA is typically single-stranded unlike
DNA which you normally see two strands
and a helix together with each other but
even though it's single-stranded it's
still composed of nitrogenous bases just
like the DNA deoxynucleotides R so this
means that RNA also has the ability to
base pair in this case your cell behaves
in RNA like thymine behaves in DNA and
so uracil binds with adenine the same
way that thymine would bind with adenine
so hopefully you'll notice that based on
the chemistry alone RNA DNA are very
similar and there are just a few
differences that distinguish them
chemically speaking these differences
are very important and again out of the
scope of this course you may find out
later exactly why DNA and RNA are so
different and why their functions can
vary so much I want you to see if you
can tell me which one of the following
images do you think best represents RNA
as it is most likely found in the cell
do you think you'd see a single strand
of RNA just as a straight linear strand
all laid out like this first option or
do you think you would see something
that looks like this where the single
strand has folded back on itself in
certain areas where it appears there may
be some base pairing whichever answer
you end up picking I'd like for you to
try and justify your answer in the text
box here explaining why you think the
RNA would look like that inside a cell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
