our sound and then print the name of the
file where we actually recorded our
voice at this point I want us to
consider two scenarios that can cause
some trouble going forward the first one
has to do with our storyboard so let me
go back to Xcode now we know that we are
recording our voice in here in the first
scene or in record sounds view
controller we also know that we need
that recorded file in here in the second
scene or in play sounds view controller
right now when we hit this stop button
we move very promptly from this first
scene to the second scene do you think
we will need to pass the audio file from
the first scene to the second scene
if so how would we go about doing that
so here is the first scenario that we
need to think deeply about the second
scenario has to do with recording audio
right now the sounds that we are
recording are really short about five to
ten seconds long what do you think will
happen if our user records a
conversation with a friend for about
five minutes I would imagine that it
will take our phone some time to process
that audio properly now picture this our
phone is in the middle of processing a
really large sound file here in the
first scene while we have pushed the
stop button and moved on to the second
scene and already started to play the
audio that hasn't fully finished
recording yet that could cause some
troubles so then the question is how
will we know that the phone has
successfully finished recording in the
first scene before we play that audio in
the second scene now I want you to think
about both of these scenarios and then
write down your reflections in these
boxes on how you would go about solving
both of these issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
