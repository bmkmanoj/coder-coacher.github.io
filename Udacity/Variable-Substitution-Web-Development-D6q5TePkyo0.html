templates first thing we're going to
learn is variable substitution
the syntax for in substituting a
variable in Jinja is just double curly
braces and then you include your
variable name and then you close your
curly braces pretty simple right
basically these curly braces it just
means print it's as if you type the
print statement in the middle of your
HTML code so let's see what that looks
like in practice okay I'm going to go
into my shopping list HTML file and add
I'm just going to add a string right to
the bottom of the file okay so I just
said hello and then I added in curly
curly name now where as name to find it
is not defined anywhere yet let's see
what happens when I reload this page
with just this Here I am in the browser
let's reload this page it says hello and
there's nothing there actually we can
get rid of this egg that's a little left
over so Jinja if the variable is not
defined just quietly doesn't include it
now let's go ahead and include name
let's just kind of hack this in real
quick name equals Steve okay so remember
before I was talking about this star
star syntax name equals Steve basically
gets passed in as star star kW which
gets passed along here which gets
received by render string as star star
params just different variable names to
be deliberately confusing for some
reason and which gets passed into the
render function from gin jet which
expects keyword parameters so it's going
to define name equals Steve and if we go
to our browser and reload this we see it
says hello Steve let's see if we can
make this a little bit fancier what if
instead of name equals Steve all the
time we said name equals self dot
requests that get name so we can put
name as a parameter let's see if that
works okay if I reload this page I get
nothing because there is no parameter
but if I had name equals Udacity we can
see that Udacity appears in our template
okay
so right now we've basically have this
very elaborate way of doing string
substitution via these files but we can
we can already see we're somewhat on the
right direction of having cleaner code
and time for a quick quiz okay so what I
want you to do is use variable
substitution the syntax I just showed
you
to make this string the quick brown and
then the variable animal one jumped over
the lazy and then the variable animal to
go ahead and type this complete string
with the correct variable substitutions
for these variables in the box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
