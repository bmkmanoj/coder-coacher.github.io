okay equals to suppose we have the same
forwarding table as before but now each
node in the Tri is responsible for
resolving two bits so if we take one one
and now we take one star that's 1 0 &amp;amp; 1
1 and now we basically have to put p1 in
two places in the tree 1 0 star results
in just one entry 1 0 1 0 star results
in 2 traversals and 1 0 1 0 1 star again
represents two entries for 1 0 1 0 1 0 &amp;amp;
1 0 1 0 1 1 now suppose we want to look
up 1 0 1 1 1 again we can spell this out
1 0 1 and we can see that we get no
further than p2 and again we match at p2
one thing we can do to save space
further is create what's called a leaf
pushed try in such a setting we can save
ourselves some space instead of having
these pointers we can push these entries
into the left and right side of this
node respectively so 1 0 becomes p1 on
the left side and 1 one becomes p1 on
the right side there are a variety of
other optimization algorithms including
one called luleå and another called
patricia each of them use the same basic
idea that we've explored here except
some of them like luleå are a
three-level try and often they use a
bitmap to compress out repeated entries
such as those that exist here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
