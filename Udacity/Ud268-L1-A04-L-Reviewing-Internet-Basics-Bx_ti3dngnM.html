terms for for things like server browser
but some of these might be new maybe
request or client either way it's
important to have a solid grasp of what
these words mean and how they fit
together before we move on trying to
develop web apps without first
understanding the basics of the web is
just not really a good idea it makes
debugging and troubleshooting apps
extremely difficult and it's basically a
giant headache so here's our crash
course on everything you need to know to
set this stage for developing apps with
Sinatra in less than five minutes here
we go so what's the internet well put
simply it's just a bunch of
interconnected computers computers that
talk to each other here's a computer and
here's another one and now they're
connected in a conversation talking to
each other we can add a few more in of
course the internet actually consists of
way more computers talking to each other
all the time all sorts of different
connections so what do they talk about
well some of these computers have
information stored on them that they can
share with other computers we call those
computers servers millions billions
maybe more of servers hold all the
information and websites that make up
the world wide web waiting for computers
like yours to reach out and start a
conversation check out this crazy map of
the internet and all of its servers
that's a lot of computers so how do all
these computers talk to each other
