decidable property here all of the other
properties are undecidable now let's go
quickly through them one by one to
discuss why that is so always returns
one you know that is undecidable by rice
theorem it's a similar case here we
already had that adding two numbers rice
theorem doesn't do anything rice theorem
no matter how you define doesn't do
anything it will always come back to
rice theorem converts an mp3 file rice
theorem read the file that is an
interesting one because you could argue
that this does not fall under rice
theorem but even if you have that
argument it's so not decidable because
what I could do for example so I can
modify any programs so that it only will
read a file once it's done and that
again would allow me to solve the
halting problem is a program of virus
rice theorem rights to a file similar
logic as reads to a file modifies itself
that is an interesting one because of
course here you could against a well of
course I can just go through the code
and whenever the program accesses itself
I know it has that property but the
thing is this the program could have
certain lines that suggest this program
modifies itself but deciding whether
those lines will actually be reached
once the program executes that again
would allow you to solve the halting
problem so also this isn't decidable or
the same one here of course you can look
at a certain program and say does this
program return integers but if you had a
program that can decide if another
program only returns interest that would
again allow you to solve the halting
problem and the same thing for
downloading data if I had a program that
designs generally for any other program
if it downloads data I could use the
same technique as for reading a file I
could basically modify any program so
that it will run completely on its own
data that it already has included and
downloads data basically to signify that
it's done if I could decide this in the
general case then I would also have
solved the halting problem now the
question of course is if this year has
any practical relevance for example
reading a file because for most programs
of course you will be able to decide if
they ever read a file or not then again
on the other hand if you look at general
software testing this is an interesting
question from a perspective of code
coverage for it
example if you could decide if a program
reads the file and of course you want
the program to read a file then that
would tell you something about the
correctness of that program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
