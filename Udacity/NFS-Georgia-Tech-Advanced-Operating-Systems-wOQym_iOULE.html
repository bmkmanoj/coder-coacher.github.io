time but the idea is still the same you
have clients that are distributed all
over the local area network and you have
file servers sitting on the local area
network and these file servers are
central so far as each client is
concerned of course the system
administrator may partition these
servers and say that there is one server
designated for a certain class of users
for instance if you take a university
setting you might have one server
serving all the Faculty's needs and
maybe another server serving all the
student needs but so far as a single
client is concerned it is still a
centralized view access to a central
server over a local area network now
since the disk being electromagnetic is
slow the server will cache the files
that it retrieves from the disk in
memory so that it can serve the clients
better by serving it out of the file
cache that is in memory rather than
going to the disk all the time so this
is a typical structure of a network file
system a centralized server which is the
model used in NFS is a serious source of
bottleneck for scalability a single
server has to field the client request
coming from the group of users that it
is serving and manage all the data and
metadata for all the files that are host
on this particular server and the data
and the metadata of files are persistent
data structures and therefore the file
server has to access these data
structures over the i/o bus which is
available for talking to the disk
subsystem so with a centralized server
like this there is limited bandwidth
that's available for the server to get
the data and the metadata in and out of
the disk and the file system cache is
also limited because it is confined to
the memory space that's available in a
given server
so instead of this centralized view of
the file system can we implement the
file system in a distributed manner what
does that mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
