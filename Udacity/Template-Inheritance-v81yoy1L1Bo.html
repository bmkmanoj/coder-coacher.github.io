you today it's called template
inheritance now we can make this quite
complex but for our purposes we're just
going to do this simple thing that will
make our templates much easier to use if
you notice on a web page let's draw one
most web pages have you know a title and
a footer and then they have some content
in the middle you know this might be the
page / and then you might have another
page that looks identical you know maybe
this is the / like about page it also
has a title it also has a footer the
same title in the same footer and it has
some different content when you're
generating HTML you don't want to have
to generate the you know write the same
title in the same footer over and over
again just like in your code when you
use functions and classes to better
organize your code so you don't have to
write the same piece of code over and
over again you can organize your
templates in the same way and that's
what I want to talk about right now you
can use template inheritance so you can
have one template that includes the
header and the footer and then you can
have a bunch of sub templates that use
that just that that redefine the content
in the middle so here's how we're going
to organize our code now so here's what
we have right now in our code we have
shopping list about HTML and we have
visible that HTML and these files don't
have anything in common but we want to
give we want to add a little title to
this page we're going to make each of
these inherit from base HTML and we're
gonna make each of these inherit from
base HTML and base HTML is going to have
some common HTML that these two
templates will share to make them match
a little better and I'll just go ahead
and show you an example of how to do
this so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make a new file called base HTML
I'm going to go head and put in it
things I want these files that have in
common I'm also going to do proper HTML
document this time my saved at its base
HTML now remember HTML documents start
with a doctype and then we have the HTML
tag and then we have the head and within
the head we can have the title and so
both of our pages will share this title
within that or within HTML we have body
now I'm going to add a new syntax here
okay so then we have our we have our
body open and close and then we close
our HTML this is the basic structure of
an HTML document and it's what goes
inside body that makes
the page unique know what to change our
title too while we're at it but let's
just worry about the body and ginger the
syntax that we can use will look
something like this the syntax for
creating a black and a black is
something that will be shared amongst
templates you just say squiggle % block
and then you give the block a name in
this guy's we're going to call it
content and then you can say n block and
we can make each of our templates use
this block of content so let's show how
we would use this base HTML in shopping
list let's add some code to our body
that all of our templates are going to
have in common I'm going to add a little
a header across the top okay so if it
just added a little title that we're
going to put across the top of our page
it's just in each one and I gave it a
little extra styling this is CSS we gave
it a background color of DDD and a
foreground color of 888 this is kind of
grey with slightly darker grey on top of
it I got rid of its Marge and then I
gave it a height of 50 pixels also I'm
going to add a little style to the body
this will make it lay out a little bit
nicer margin 0 ok so let's go ahead and
use this template in our shopping list
the syntax for this is quite simple all
we do is at the top of our file we say
extends based at HTML this this tells
this template that we're going to be a
part of based at HTML now let's see what
this does in practice we're sure
everything is saved nothing here has
changed in our main handler we're still
rendering shopping list HTML let's go to
our front page ok it's the quite a mess
here let's reload this once i reloaded
we can see that the header that i wrote
is here with the kind of grey on grey
background but none of our content is
here let's look at the source for this
ok we basically see this is our base at
HTML file but we're not seeing any of
that content because that was in that
block content and we didn't overwrite
that so let's go ahead and take a look
at our templates again this is our bait
HTML this is basically what we were
seeing as the source in our browser but
our shopping list of HTML hasn't
actually filled in this content yet
let's see how we do that all you do is
hear you say block content and this this
line here block and then the name
content matches this line here and base
that HTML and they put a closing one at
the
and black we save this file and we go
back to our browser and when I reload
this page we see all of our stuff down
here now within our base HTML template
and when we view this source we can see
we have the base HTML header then we can
see we have our form content here in the
middle and then we can have the down
here there's hard to see because of the
scrolling but the end of the base HTML
template so that's pretty handy right
this allows us to separate the content
of our pages and the templates for that
content from the surrounding content
that all of our other pages might have
in common and I use this a lot in this
in this course especially during the
blog and and some of the other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
