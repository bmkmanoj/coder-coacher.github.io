we've covered a lot of programming
techniques but we've mostly done it with
small examples of code in this unit
we're going to look at a larger example
than anything we've seen before we're
going to write an algorithm for finding
the highest scoring play in a crossword
tile game now versions of this game go
by names like Scrabble and words with
friends so we're going to have to
represent everything about the words the
tiles the board the scoring and and the
algorithm for finding the
highest-scoring word that's going to be
more code I'm going to be writing a lot
of it and you're going to get practice
reading and that's an important skill
but I'm also going to stop and leave you
plenty of places where you can write
some of the code and at any point if you
want a bigger challenge you can stop the
video and go ahead yourself and try to
solve as much of it as you can on your
own and I would encourage you to do that
this is a big step up I think you're all
ready for it so let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
