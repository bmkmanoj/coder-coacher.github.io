Turing machines at the beginning of last
lecture I said that the Turing machine
precisely captures the notion of
computation in this lecture we'll give
strong evidence for this church-turing
thesis the statement did everything
computable was computable by turning
machine the church-turing thesis is
named for Alan Turing and Alonzo Church
church had an alternative model of
computation known as the lambda calculus
which turns out to be exactly as
powerful as a Turing machine we call the
church to a thesis a thesis because it
isn't a statement that we could prove or
disprove in this lecture we'll give a
strong argument that our simple Turing
machine can do anything today's
computers can do where anything that
computer could ever do in the future to
convince you of the church-turing thesis
I'll start from the basic Turing machine
and then branch out showing that it is
equivalent to machines as powerful as
the most advanced machines today or in
any conceivable future we'll begin by
looking at multi tape turing machines
which in many cases are much easier to
work with and will show that anything a
multi tape turing machine can do a
regular turing machine can do two then
we'll consider the random access model a
model capturing all the important
capabilities of a modern computer and we
will show that it is equivalent to a
multi tape turing machine and therefore
it must also be equivalent to a regular
Turing machine this means that a simple
Turing machine can compute anything your
Intel i7 can or whatever chip you may
happen to have in your computer
hopefully by the end of the lesson you
will have understood all these
connections and you'll be convinced that
the church-turing thesis really is true
formally we can state it like this a
language or a function for that matter
is computable and I've used quotes here
to indicate that we mean this in the
common meaning of the word and not in a
technical sense if and only if it can be
decided on the case of a function
computed by a Turing machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
