in which it is recommended to use the
extract method refactoring when there is
duplicated code in two or more methods
and we want to take this coat factory
doubt and basically have the two methods
called a third method which is the one
that we create using the refactoring
when a class is too large normally we
don't want to apply the extract method
instead in these cases it is usually
more appropriate to use the extract
class or extract subclass refactorings
analogously when the names of two
classes are too similar extracting a
matter will normally not help much and
all we need to do in case having two
similar names is actually a problem is
to rename one of the two classes or both
if we wish finally it is definitely
appropriate to apply the extract method
refactoring in cases in which a method
is highly coupled with a class other
than the one where it is defined in this
case which we will discuss also later in
the lesson the extract method
refactoring allows us to extract the
part of the method that is coupled with
the other class then we can take the
matter that we just extracted and move
it to the class where it actually
belongs so the extract method is one of
the two refactorings that it is
appropriate to apply in these cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
