function let's put those pieces together
we'll write a few function definitions
together and then call those functions
we'll start with a description of the
task the function should accomplish and
go from there here's one you may have
seen before write a function that takes
in the string and returns the first
character of that string again we start
with the funk and then we need a name
I'm going to call this one first
character of I'll add my parentheses in
my curly braces in general don't shy
away from long names especially in the
age of code completion it's more
important to be descriptive than it is
to save yourself a few milliseconds of
typing it also would have been fine to
call this function first character but I
want to emphasize that the naming
convention in objective-c and Swift is
to use prepositions and function names
to refer to the first parameter in this
case a string here this function is
returning the first character of the
string bean passed in so we have our
name next comes the parameter between
parentheses let's call the string we're
going to pass in word that'll be its
local parameter name and then we specify
its type string and next comes a narrow
and the return type our return type in
this case is going to be character and
i'm just going to write return X here so
that we can quiet that error for the
time being and finally we get to the
meat of the function in between curly
braces here we'll put the statements we
want to execute there are a number of
ways to get the first character of a
string in Swift i'm going to use
subscript syntax with the index start
index and of course once we get that
value we want to return it ok now it's
time to call it first character of is a
global function so in order to call it
we just write its name and then pass in
a parameter between parentheses and over
here in the sidebar we can see that the
first character of mom is being returned
now notice that we didn't give our
parameter an external name we only gave
it the local name word thus when we
called it we just passed in the
parameter itself let's go ahead and add
an external name to our parameter it's
kind of hard to come up with another
word for word so I'm just going to use
word again and now that we specify
an external parameter name we need to
use that external parameter name in the
function call now you've probably
noticed that the compiler is complaining
about something let's see what it has to
say word word can be expressed more
succinctly as hash mark word it wants us
to use the shortcut for external
parameter names that are the same as
local parameter names if we just place a
hash mark in front of the local
parameter name we let the compiler know
that the external and the local
parameter names are the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
