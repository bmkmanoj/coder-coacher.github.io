version of the Java development kit
installed we have one more step before
we start programming we need to tell our
computer where to find the development
kit and we do that by changing our
computers environment variables so let's
close out of this command prompt and to
get to your computer's environment
variables you'll first want to right
click on your Start menu and go to your
system and system is just referring to
your computer so click on this then you
should see a system window pop up and on
the left we have something called
advanced system settings this is what
we'll want to change so click on this
this gets you to another window system
properties and at the bottom right of
this window is a button labeled
environment variables environment
variables affect how your computer runs
so make sure to follow along closely so
click on this environment variables
button and you should see another window
that shows all the variables your
computer recognizes we're only
interested in one thing here and that's
the path variable the path is where our
computer looks for programming resources
and we need to add our JDK to this path
so select this path variable and click
Edit you might already see some program
files in here and we want to add our
downloaded JDK to this list to do that
we're first going to create a new
variable and let's just name it new and
press enter then with this still
selected will click browse to find our
JDK first go to your home directory your
C Drive and inside here are your program
files you should have downloaded a
version of the JDK to go in your program
files x86 folder so let's expand this
and in here is our Java folder so click
on that inside our Java folder you'll
see folders for our JDK and jari we're
interested in the JDK and inside our JDK
you should see this folder labeled bin
and this is what we want to add to our
program file list so select
bin and press ok and then you should see
our bin file appear in this list and
we're almost done make sure to press ok
as you exit this window and also make
sure to press ok in this environment
variables window and we can close out of
the rest of our windows and now we're
ready to write a simple program you can
use any text editor to write a Java
program and i'll be using notepad
notepad can be found in my applications
under windows accessories you can also
find notepad by searching for it so all
open a new notepad document and now
we're ready to write a program in plain
text like this one here is a program
that contains code that will print out
the string hello world to our computer
screen and i'll provide this code in the
notes so that you can copy and paste
this into your own text document and
don't have to write it all yourself so
first you see these words public class
hello world and the class in Java is
just a way to contain functions in code
and refer to our program so this class
will be called hello world all one word
with a capital age and a capital W then
inside this is the main function public
static void main and this is where our
computer will go to read and actually
execute code and we'll learn more about
both classes and this main function
later so don't worry if you don't
understand all of this right now just
know that the code inside of our main
function will be executed by our
computer when we run this program so
inside main is this print code which
should look familiar it's a print line
statement that prints out hello world
now to compile and execute this code we
first have to save this text as a Java
file so let's go to file and save we
won't be saving this as a text document
so make sure to change this to be all
files and let's name this Java file the
same as our class name helloworld dot
java
so our full file name should be
helloworld dot java and i'm just going
to save it on my desktop so that it will
be easy to find so i'm going to click
save and it's actually very important
that this document have the same name as
our class the name hello world all one
word with a capital H in capital W now
that we've saved this as a Java file we
can compile and run it from a command
prompt window so let's open command
prompt like we've done before my first
command will be to navigate to the
directory where my java file is saved
and that's my desktop so i type CD space
desktop and press enter and CD just
means change directory then once we're
in the right directory we need to
compile our code and to do that we type
in the name of our compiler Java C then
a space and the name of our program
helloworld dot java and press ENTER this
might take a couple seconds to compile
and if it's successful our command
prompt will move on to another line if
you get any errors it's most likely
because your computer can't find the
Java C compiler because your environment
variables haven't been changed or maybe
your file name doesn't match your class
name so if you get an error check on
those potential sources environment
variables and matching file name and
once this compiles successfully our last
step is to execute our code and we do
that by typing in Java than a space in
the name of our program this time
without the Java extension this word
Java tells our computer that this is a
java program and that this is the name
of our program hello world so once you
have those two words press ENTER and we
should see the expected print output
right below hello world great job and we
can run this program multiple times by
just saying Java HelloWorld and pressing
enter but if we want to change anything
like the text that prints out we have to
go back to our text file and change our
code in
let's go back and change our print Lin
so that it prints out hello Java instead
of hello world I can go back to my
notepad file and change this to Java and
remember to save then if we go back to
our command prompt we can run our
program again Java HelloWorld but wait a
second this still prints out hello world
not hello Java and that's because even
for small changes like changing the
print output in our Java file the whole
file has to be compiled again before it
will reflect the changes and actually
you may have noticed this extra file
that's been created in the corner of our
desktop it's called hello world class
and it gets created when we first
compile our code this is actually the
output of our Java C compiler the
compiler takes in a Java file and
creates a class file that our computer
can understand so whenever we make a
change we have to compile our Java
program again by typing Java Sea hello
world java and press enter now let's try
running this code again by typing Java
HelloWorld and now it prints out the
updated print line hello Java so writing
code in the text editor like notepad and
then compiling and running it separately
in the command prompt can get kind of
tedious especially when you want to
change anything in the code and to make
it easier to organize and write code
will be downloading an integrated
development environment also known as an
IDE development environments include
Java compilers so this will make it
easier to write and run our code in the
same application there are a number of
environments that help programmers code
in Java and we'll be using IntelliJ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
