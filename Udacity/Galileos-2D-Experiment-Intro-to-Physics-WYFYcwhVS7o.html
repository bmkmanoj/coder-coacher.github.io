two dimensions well he was a good
scientist so we did an experiment this
experiment involved rolling balls off of
a table and controlling the speed with
which they rolled off the table and
measuring where the ball landed Galileo
controlled the speed of the ball by
adjusting the height from which it
rolled so if he wanted to go faster he
would roll it from higher up I will talk
later about how exactly he could know
where to put the ball
Galileo controlled the speed of the ball
by adjusting where in the plane he
released it from higher up of course
meant it would be going faster by the
time it got to the edge of the table
like in his previous experiments he
didn't know the units of his velocity
but he knew their relative sizes so for
example he knew he could make the
velocity twice as big as it was
originally or three or four times bigger
and look what he found again these are
unitless distances but look at this
correspondence when the ball had a
velocity of one unit so represented here
the trajectory looks something like this
with a velocity of two units the ball
went twice as far
likewise with three and four units of
initial horizontal velocity you'll
notice I've called this V X this X
indicates an X direction when we label
axes we usually call the horizontal
direction X and the vertical Y and so
this X is just here to remind us that
we're talking about a velocity in the
horizontal direction okay so this is
pretty interesting so what's the
conclusion that we can draw from this
data is it that the horizontal velocity
is equal to the motion in the X
direction the horizontal velocity is
somehow proportional to the motion in
the X direction where the horizontal
velocity and X Direction motion are
totally unrelated what's the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
