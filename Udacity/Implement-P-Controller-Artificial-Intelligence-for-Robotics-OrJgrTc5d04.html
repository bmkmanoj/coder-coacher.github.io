controller so here's the code I prepared
from you there's a class robot with
which you're familiar it has an init you
can set the position using the function
set as before there are steering noise
and distance noise you familiar with
this there's also something called drift
which you won't use right now but later
on it will become handy and there's your
move command all the way if it was
amended before and have improved a
little bit the printout of the
coordinates using floats I want you to
implement the run command which takes as
input the control parameter that governs
the proportional response of the
steering angle to the crosstrack error
the robot has an initial position of 0 1
and 0 and speed of 1 and I wanted to
simulate this for 100 steps so here's
what I envisioned to happen your robot
is initially off the x-axis by 1 I
wanted to drive along the accesses so
the y-value is the same as the
crosstrack error by turning university
proportional to the y-value using a
parameter tau that sets the response
strength of the proportional controller
I wonder if I were to turn towards the
x-axis drive in that direction overshoot
turn around and drive back to do this
simulate the word for a hundred steps
and use the proportionality term that
sets my steering angle alpha in
proportion to the crosstrack error Y so
enter your code here and when you're
done with it and you violent with the
coefficient 0.1 here is the output I
want you to produce it's a hundred lines
you can see the volar position starting
one off and y it then reduces Y over
time to go into negative territory on
the right side you see the store
corresponding steering orientation and
you can see as you move on the Y coming
back into positive territory and you can
see how the word overshoots slowly
around the reference trajectory of the x
axis so please go implement this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
