go back to our navigation world imagine
that we already have cases a B C and D
we might use a very simple indexical
scheme to begin with we might say we'll
simply index each case with its initial
location and the initial location will
have a x-coordinate and a y-coordinate
so the case a may be indexed by its
initial location which is 3e and 9n and
similarly for b c and d now imagine that
we have a new case X of going from the
office to the restaurant recall that
we're indexing cases right now very
simply by the XY coordinate of the
initial location we'll index case X by
the XY coordinates of the initial
location as shown here let me repeat
this is really a very simple indexical
scheme we're using here as we learned in
the KNN lesson last time we really
should be using a more complicated
indexical scheme which takes into
account both the initial location and
echo location nevertheless this conveys
the basic notion of an index an index is
like a tag at least in principle we
could come up with a fairly rich
indexical scheme for this particular
class of problems we don't have to limit
ourselves to just in numerical
coordinates of the initial and the goal
locations for example in this navigation
micro world the indices may include
whether a route is scenic or not scenic
where the route is fast or not fast so
going back to our perking an example we
were working with file input and we
could have a very rich indexical
structure for organizing cases of filing
but according to various different
parameters and variables for example I
might tag the individual cases of file
input according to whether I use Java
Python C++ I might tag them according to
whether they were very fast or very slow
I might tag them according to what kind
of file they read into their read text
that they read XML did they read some
other kind of file format each of those
values then becomes a particular way of
identifying each individual case such
that when I'm given a new problem I can
find the most similar case by seeing
which one matches the most of those
variables that's an important point we
want to use an indexical structure which
allows for effective and efficient
retrieval because
we're storing things only because we
want to be able to retrieve them at a
later time in case of design more
generally people have developed
indexical structures they have to do it
functions with operating environment
where performance criteria and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
