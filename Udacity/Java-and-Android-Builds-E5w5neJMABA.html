bad at first glance you just call Java C
on your source files and it spits out
some class files you can also copy over
resources like images and strings for
distribution you can jar up your class
files and resources and you're done
right well you might also want to
generate some documentation running some
unit tests probably sounds like it would
be a good idea as well if you're getting
really serious you might even want to
run multiple sets of unit tests
including integration acceptance tests
then assuming those tests pass you might
want to deploy your jar to a repository
this is starting to sound like it's a
lot of work to do by hand but not
impossible right or you could write a
shell script that will automate this
process it'd be messy but it's doable
Android apps on the other hand are
beasts the Java source isn't compiled a
standard Java bytecode but two custom by
code for the Android runtime Android has
three different types of resources that
all get packaged differently there's an
additional wrinkle and that the
resources that you define need to be
pooled together with resources come from
your included libraries and the
identifier of all those resources need
to be known beforehand before anything
else gets compiled also Android apps
must be cryptographically signed when
you put all that together it looks
something like this
now consider you might want to build
both debug and release versions of your
app you might also want to build free
and paid variants the point is is that
the process of building an Android app
is not something we can do by hand it's
not even something that we can do in a
shell script we need a more robust
solution that solution comes to Android
in the form of Gradle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
