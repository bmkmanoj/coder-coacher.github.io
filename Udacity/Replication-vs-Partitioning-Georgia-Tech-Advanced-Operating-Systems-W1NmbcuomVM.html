computational resources that back the
data store add a server a system
administrator has a choice of either
replicating or partitioning the data if
you are replicating the data what that
means is that every data server has the
full corpus of data that is needed to
serve a particular request think of it
as say Gmail if it is Gmail then if a
gmail request gets sent to any one of
these servers they can handle the
request that comes in because of they
have the full corpus of data to deal
with the incoming requests we mentioned
that failures are inevitable in giant
scale services because of the number of
computational elements that live within
a data center if failures occur what
happens when we have replicated data
what that means is that the harvest is
going to be unchanged because even if
some data repositories failed because it
is replicated we can redirect a client
request to another life server that has
full access to the data repository and
therefore the harvest that you're going
to get with replication is 100% it is
unaffected on the other hand because the
server capacity has come down due to
these failures the yield is going to
come down in other words with
replication the service is unavailable
for some users for some amount of time
but all the users that are able to get
the service get complete harvest in
terms of the fidelity for the query that
is returned and answered by the server
the other alternative of course for
architecting the internal data
repository of a server is to partition
the data so if you partition the data
and let's say that there are n
partitions of the full corpus of data
and let's say that some of the server's
fail then some portion of the full
corpus of data becomes unavailable if
this happens what it means is that the
harvest is going to be done because some
portion of the data corpus is
unavailable and therefore the harvest is
going to come down but it is possible to
keep Q unchanged so long as the
computational capacities
unchanged then we can serve the same
number of user community it's just that
the fidelity of the result may not be as
good as when all of the data corpus is
available for example if this is a
server that is serving search results
and if some portion of the data
repository is unavailable in that case
each query that comes in will get
service but it is going to get a subset
of the query results for the search that
they are doing so the important message
that I want to convey through these
pictures is that DQ is independent of
whether we are replicating of your
partitioning the data given a certain
server capacity the DQ is a constant
because we are assuming that disk is
cheap disk space is cheap and therefore
processing incoming requests are not
disk bound but it is network bound the
only exception is if the queries result
in significant write traffic to the disk
now this is rare in giant scale services
but if that happens then replication may
require more DQ than partitioning but as
a first order of approximation so long
as we assume that giant scale services
are serving client requests which are
network bound the DQ is independent of
the strategy that is used by the system
administrator for managing the data
whether it is replication or
partitioning now what this also means is
that this is giving an object lesson to
the system administrator in saying that
beyond a certain point you probably want
to replicate and partition why because
failures are bound to happen and a
failure is a bound to happen if you
partition the data then a portion of the
data corpus becomes unavailable on the
other hand if beyond a certain point
even if you have partitioned data if you
replicate it then your making sure that
even if one replica is down some of the
replicas of the same but
addition is available for serving a
particular client request and
replication beyond a certain point is
important because users would normally
prefer complete data or incomplete
harvest
take for instance your accessing your
email through the internet you would
rather put up with a service being
unavailable for some amount of time
rather than seeing that you only have
access to a portion of your mailbox and
that's the reason why replication beyond
a certain point is better for dealing
with giant scale services on the other
hand for searches it may be okay to have
a harvest which is not complete so in
structuring different services as a
giant scale service one has to make a
decision of whether partitioning is the
right approach or at what point we may
want to partition and then replicate as
well as a concrete example Inc to me
which is a CDN server uses partial
replication it uses full replication for
email because of what I just said and
that is a user would expect complete
harvest for a service like email but on
the other hand if it is a web cache that
is being implemented as a giant scale
service it is okay if it is not
replicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
