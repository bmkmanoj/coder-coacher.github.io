this unit but the topic is important
enough that I'll cover it here as we
move the camera or objects through a
scene models become larger and smaller
for very large scenes with many objects
rendering everything in the scene at
full detail can make us lose any shred
of interactivity we've seen how there
are limits to how large a texture needs
to be in fact it's usually best if the
texel two pixel ratio stays at about one
to one more than that and the texture
can just become a source of noise
choosing the proper data representation
is part of a much wider topic called
level of detail in this area of computer
graphics the focus is on how to change
an object's representation as its size
on the screen changes methods must
balance trade-offs between performance
and quality the two major areas where
level of detail techniques come into
play are with meshes and textures
textures can be down sampled to create
MIT maps so that the proper texture
level can be used for a scene as a
textured object gets farther away a
smaller texture on the MIT map is needed
there are also limits for how much
memory as GPU has available for texture
storage for very large data sets such as
a city or world map it's impossible to
save all the high resolution textures in
memory at the same time since we know
that when an object is small on the
screen it will need only a lower
resolution texture we can design our
system to load only the low resolution
textures out of the MIT chain as we zoom
in on a particular object we can load
the higher and higher resolution
textures at the same time we can be
deleting the higher resolution textures
for objects that are now receding from
view or have been clipped off the screen
entirely as an object gets smaller on
the screen we can also consider
simplifying the illumination equation in
other words using shaders with fewer
instructions for example if we get far
away enough from an object its
displacement map may add very little
detail displacement maps help in
particular by giving a more realistic
silhouette to an object at a distance
these fine details are less important as
an object gets smaller switching from a
displacement map to a normal map then to
no bump map at all saves considerable
amounts of memory mesh geometry itself
can be thought of in the same terms as a
mesh gets smaller on the screen fewer
vertices are need to represent its
details for objects that are tessellated
into triangles this means a smaller
tessellation factor can be given for
more complex objects that do not have a
simple tessellation factor simplified
meshes have to
created by hand or by what's called a
decimation algorithm such algorithms try
to find the least important triangles
and patch up their areas with fewer
triangles here's an example by Paulo
cignoli using meshlab a powerful and
free mesh manipulator these automatic
techniques are effective but can run
into problems with objects such as faces
where the lips and eyes should be less
subject to simplification because of
their importance in MIT mapping we
interpolate between two textures in the
MIT pyramid with level of detail
techniques for geometry we can do the
same with what are called geo morphs
this technique can provide a smoother
transition between levels of detail but
at the cost of additional processing and
memory which is in opposition to much of
the point of using level of detail
techniques in the first place it's much
more common to simply replace a model
with its simplified version when it
becomes smaller on the screen you
sometimes see a pop if the two versions
of the model differ considerably 3gs
supports this form of level of detail in
this demo you can see different versions
of the sphere model being used depending
on the distance from the viewer these
are explicitly chosen by the programmer
if you look closely you'll see four
different levels of detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
