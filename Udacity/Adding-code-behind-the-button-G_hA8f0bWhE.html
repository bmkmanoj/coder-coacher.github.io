perfectly centered on screen on both an
iPhone and an iPad this isn't the view
of the viewcontroller.swift class now we
need a way to connect a record button to
the code in the view controller since we
need to work with both of you and the
view controller at the same time need a
way to show them both simultaneously in
Xcode there's a great way to do this
next code call the assistant editor to
switch to it first make sure that we've
selected the main dot storyboard file as
you can see here and it's showing in the
content editor then click the assistant
editor button here on the top right it's
the one that looks like two circles
intertwine then make sure that we have
the view controller selected here things
are getting a bit crowded in our Xcode
window let's close out the inspectors
window for now with the key shortcut
command option zero let's also hide the
debug area for now by pressing the
button here to hide it we're going to
use something called an IB action to
link the button to the view controller
it links the pressing of the button to a
function inside the view controller this
is known as a target action the target
is the view controller and the action is
a function we're about to create select
the record button you can do it here in
a document outline and then holding down
the control key drag it over until it's
right above the last curly brace inside
a viewcontroller.swift file let go and
then from the drop down select action
let's give this action a name such as
record audio and then click the connect
button you can see Xcode has created a
function for us called record audio and
is connected this button to this
function in the view controller class we
can see this function is connected
because it has this field and circle
here on the left side of the bar this
field and circle indicates that this is
a special type of function called an IB
action that has a button or other UI
element connected to it now every time
the user presses the record button this
function is going to get called a good
practice in software development is to
test your code often our pitch-perfect
app is no exception
let's not align of what I like to call
caveman debugging to this
action to print out to the console that
the button was pressed inside this
function let's add a print command so
that we can just print out record button
was pressed every time the user presses
this button let's press the Run button
and test this app out in my case I've
selected the iPhone 6s as a simulator to
use now when I press the record button I
can see the record button pressed is
showing in the console press it again I
can see that it's happening there it's
listing here on the right why do I call
it caveman debugging well it's the
oldest and simplest form of debugging
your code just by logging something to
the console later in these courses
you're going to learn some really
powerful ways to watch debug and step
into the execution of your code for now
we can be content with using caveman
debugging to ensure that the recorded
audio function is getting called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
