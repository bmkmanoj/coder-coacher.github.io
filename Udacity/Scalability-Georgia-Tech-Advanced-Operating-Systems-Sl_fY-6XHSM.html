expectation as you add more processors
to the system your expectation is
natural if you think that if you add if
you add more processors your performance
should go up so this expectation this is
what is called scalability that the
performance of a parallel machine is
going to scale up as you increase the
number of processors reasonable
reasonable they expect that
however I've mentioned just now that
there is overhead associated with
increasing the number of processors in
terms of maintaining cache coherence
when you have sharing that is happening
for shared data and so therefore the pro
in adding more processors is the fact
that you can exploit parallelism that's
the reason why you're able to get this
expectation of increased performance
with processors but unfortunately as you
increase the number of processors there
is increased overhead and and there's
increased overhead also grows as you
increase the number of processors more
overhead is going to be incurred by the
system if you have an eight processor
SMP the overhead for cache coherence is
less then if you have a sixteen
processor SMP or a thirty-two processor
or a 64 processor so the overhead is
going to grow as a result you can see
that you have the pro of exploiting
parallelism but you have the con of
increased overhead and you end up with
an actual performance that's somewhere
in the middle between your expectation
and the overhead so in some sense is the
difference between what your expectation
is and what the overhead you're paying
and that becomes your actual delivered
performance of a parallel machine and
this is very important to remember that
your delivered performance may not
necessarily be linear in the number of
processors that you add to the system so
what should we do
to get good performance don't share
memory across threads as much as
possible
if you want good performance from the
parallel machine a quote that is
attributed to a famous computer
scientist Chuck Thacker comes to mind
shared memory machines scale well when
you don't share
memory of course as operating system
designers we have no control or what the
application program at us all we can do
is to ensure that the use of shared data
structures is kept to a minimum in the
implementation of the operating system
code itself you will see how relevant
Thakur's quotas as we visit operating
systems synchronization communication
and scheduling algorithms and more
generally the structure of the operating
system itself in this lesson see if you
can remind yourself of this court and
how often it permeates through our
discussion as we go through this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
