activities I've said it to show all the
possible activities it detects and you
can see that it has a percentage for
each one for example when I was testing
this earlier it determined it was a
forty five percent chance I was on foot
forty five percent chance walking twenty
five percent in a vehicle etc now it
can't be one hundred percent sure for
some activities so it's up to you as a
developer to figure out what works best
when you start a car for example you're
driving really slowly and it might think
you're biking or running for example
this app will just show you how to get
the data it's up to you to figure out
how to use it in the best possible way
for your app you're going to build this
from scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
