right is going to have the larger sum of
squared errors and it should be fairly
straightforward to see why you can
compare point by point these will be all
the errors on the left there's very
similar sum of squared errors on the
right for these data points but then on
the right you have all these additional
data points and each one of those is
going to contribute a little bit of
error that will add to the overall sum
of squared errors of the fit here so
what that means is that the distribution
on the right has a larger sum of squared
errors even though we agreed that is
probably not doing a much worse job of
fitting the data than the distribution
on the left and this is one of the
shortcomings of the sum of squared error
in general as an evaluation metric is
that as you add more data the sum of the
squared error will almost certainly go
up but it doesn't necessarily mean that
your fit is doing a worse job however if
you're comparing two different sets of
data that have different number of
points in them and this can be a big
problem because if you're using the sum
of squared errors to figure out which
one is being fit better then the sum of
squared errors can be jerked around by
the number of data points that you're
using even though the fit might be
perfectly fine so this motivates me to
tell you about one other evaluation
metric that's very popular when
evaluating regressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
