a single piece of software now at front
it took me about a whole day to do this
so I'm not going to ask you to do it all
yourself because it's going to cost you
probably at least an hour ever takes me
a day but I'm still want to be able to
take all the lessons that we did
together into a single system so going
to help you a little bit bits and pieces
but up front here is the environment
that I wrote for you which is very much
derived from the environment we studied
in the past we have a class robot that
has certain kind of noise
characteristics you can find over here
and as I scroll down you can see the
familiar in an function the position
setting function the set noise function
and then we have to checking function
whether we have a collision with a world
called grid which I'll show you in a
minute and we have a check gold function
to see if we reached a goal according to
a certain distance threshold the move
function should be very familiar at this
point it applies noise to the motion
command it's the same code that you
originally wrote and let me have a very
simple sense function which measures the
robots x value location similar to a GPS
on a car but with substantial
measurement noise corresponding to this
sense function we have a measurement
probability function that you might want
to use in your filter and it evaluates
the probability of a measurement
relative to the ground truth the
coordinates of the robot using gaussians
armed with all this here is the problem
I'm going to give you a grid here's an
example grid let me draw this for you
this specific one happens to be of
dimension 6 and 5 and there are a number
of blocked off cells like this and if
you look carefully into the code you
will find information about the initial
starting location on the left upper
corner and the goal location which is
the bottom right corner
so in putting everything together you're
going to build a robotic car using our
bicycle model they'll drive through the
free space through the continuous free
space on something close to the shortest
path all the way into the goal so here
is my solution that I implemented and
that you will get to see for most parts
towards the end of this class I am
starting up over here these are my
obstacles they implement it as circles
to the center of these grid cells not
exactly correct but good enough for my
invitation and here are multiple runs
using the same code and you can see
they're far from optimal they are not
optimal because this control noise and
there's also measurement noise but they
all make it safely through free space
into the corner where the gold objective
is if we look at them in detail like
this solution over here you'll find that
the spacing of the circles is somewhat
variable you'll find that there's little
corners over here that are either the
result of control noise or of
measurement noise or of my somewhat
deficient implementation you also find
the control set points that are the
smooth points of my a star planner as
shown here in green in the version that
I implemented for you the controller
does something very very different it
actually chooses as the control
objective to head straight to the goal
using the a-10 to function executes the
action of the speed of 0.1 and then
reports a collision whenever the robot
is moving and just looking down for the
output where we see the robots
coordinates along with the orientation
there's very frequent collisions that
everywhere undergoes in his attempt to
reach the goal which it eventually does
but you can see two big regions of
collisions until the goal is finally
reached</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
