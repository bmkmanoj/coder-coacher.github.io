a bit because we haven't talked about
friction
now even though energy can never ever be
created or destroyed friction in a way
removes energy from a system now what do
I mean by that well before when we
thought of let's say a ball dropping
from some height well we could think of
this as energy converting from
gravitational potential to kinetic
energy as it moved down all of the
gravitational went to kinetic but in
reality that's not what happens all of
the gravitational potential energy does
not get converted to kinetic energy so
how does friction do this how does it
remove energy if energy can't be created
or destroyed well before when we looked
at let's say a block sliding down a
plane we visualize this as gravitational
potential energy getting converted to
kinetic energy as the block moved down
well let's think about that as this
block slides down it's rubbing against
this plane go ahead and rub your hands
together for a second and do it really
hard they get really hot in fact
friction creates heat this heat is
another form of energy so if we start
with a certain amount of gravitational
potential energy some of it gets
converted to useful kinetic energy but
some of it gets lost as heat the energy
is still there it's just that we can't
really use it anymore it's lost is heat
to the atmosphere now depending on the
material of this plane or other
situational factors the fraction of this
energy that gets converted to heat can
change maybe a lot of this energy gets
converted to heat maybe almost none of
it so let's consider these three cases
in the first case we have an object
falling and let's say it's falling
through what's called vacuum so there's
no air it's just falling through empty
space another example of objects sliding
down this rough jagged surface and
another we have our objects sliding down
a relatively smooth surface what I want
to know is which of these diagrams
corresponds to which of these pictures
so in this diagram all of the potential
energy is getting converted to kinetic
energy and here most of it's getting
converted to heat but in here only a
small portion gets converted to heat
enter the appropriate number into the
