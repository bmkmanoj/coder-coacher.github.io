development you may find yourself
creating your own specialized tools
maybe more than you'd expect sometimes
there's just no better way to convert a
data file under the format you need or
extract font data to create a custom
texture one tool you commonly have to
write as a level editor which can
sometimes grow into a full-blown project
of its own if your game levels are big
and complex a custom level editor can
end up saving time in the long run and
it makes it much easier to release new
content to keep your game fresh it also
allows others to build levels for your
game which can be a great way to engage
your audience it's still a good idea to
represent your levels with human
readable data files because they tend to
be platform independent and you also
preserve the flexibility to make changes
with a simple text editor you might
choose to use binary data files in
production though in a same space and
it's easy to add a binary export
function if you write a dedicated level
editor I always enjoyed writing tools
and thought it was interesting how tool
development kind of happens in Reverse
compared to the game itself tools are
usually needed right away so there's a
flurry of coding activity up front games
on the other hand tend to gel at the end
it's all the individual components come
together so if you're creating a game
and the tools used to build it well
you're going to be very busy right from
the start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
