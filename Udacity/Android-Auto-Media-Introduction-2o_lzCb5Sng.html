feature of Android auto you can use
either the touch screen to select songs
based on a variety of criteria or you
can use your voice to speak the name of
a song or artist using the voice button
on the steering wheel this is great
because the user is driving a car
meaning they need minimal distractions
and they need to keep their eyes on the
road so let's take a quick look at what
it looks like to play audio with Android
auto and then I'll show you how to
implement this so here is our universal
media player sample app which is
installed and running on my phone here
Android auto is able to connect to the
app and then browse through the media
collection the user can perform a search
using voice commands play music jazz you
can also touch the screen to browse as
well so we'll pick something in the rock
genre and there you go it's that easy to
use and in this lesson I'm going to show
you how we implement all this we're
going to explain how to use the Android
media browsing framework we're gonna
walk you through a short sample that
implements basic functionality and then
how to implement a full-featured media
playing application that works on
Android auto as well as lots of other
platforms as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
