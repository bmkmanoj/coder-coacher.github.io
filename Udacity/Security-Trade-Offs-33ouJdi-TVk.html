factor and the resources I guess we hear
people say adversary is going to prevail
or we need to be paranoid or hyper
paranoid how do we strike a balance
between how paranoid we are and the
price we pay for it well one I think
typically we aren't paranoid enough
actually I would say first we need to
when we design things we need to assume
there's an adversary which a lot of
people don't don't do in particularly
when when products are rushed to market
and then I don't think that we assume a
adversary is as powerful we assume the
adversary's stupid which is again a bad
bad idea and then I think we can even
really be a little more paranoid than
that and assume they can do a little bit
more than we think maybe a lot more
depending on how important the
information the the system you're trying
to protect actually actually is when it
comes to trade off though that you could
put an infinite amount of resources
making making something secure and
conventional wisdom says and this is
actually i would say best practice from
industry is to form a calculations the
amount of money you're putting into
securing a system shouldn't exceed the
value of the item you're actually
protecting if you're building a vault to
hold the ten dollar item something's
wrong so that's part of the calculus the
other calculus i think is i personally I
don't want to live in a world of perfect
security the amount of pain involved in
our day-to-day lives makes an
overwhelming amount of security very
very unpleasant place to be so it really
comes down to risk life is about risk
banking is about risk crossing the
street is about risk so each
organization has to determine how much
risk they're willing to take understand
its security costs in terms of time and
money and resources and frustration of
your actual user base there have been
times that I haven't been able to get
into the building where I work because
of some you know glitch in the security
system where I forgot my ID card or my
pass card in another place so it comes
at a cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
