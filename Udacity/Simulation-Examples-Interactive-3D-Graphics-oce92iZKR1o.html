sections of a Technical Schools Library
and you'll see a huge amount of
information on a wide variety of
phenomena beyond drag lift and stretch
there are many other properties we could
simulate friction applied force flow us
tissa t tension normal force turbulence
spring force heat transfer gravity
thrust and so on computing these is done
by what's called a dynamic solver what
you're seeing on the screen now are a
number of different simulations done for
all sorts of phenomena a few of these
are computed at interactive speeds some
are created offline in either case the
rendering is separate from the physical
computations typically the way solvers
work is that a tiny time step is chosen
for the simulation often smaller than
the time represented by the frame the
effective forces in the scene are
computed for the sliver of time and
objects are modified this process is
done again and again time slice by time
slice small steps help avoid various
types of errors the area of physical
simulation is wide ranging and users can
have different goals an engineer or
scientist may be making a visualization
of a particular process and so the
simulator is aiming to be as realistic
and true to the physical world as
possible
if interactive speeds are not needed
then time slices can be exceedingly
small and mostly dependent on how much
compute time the user wants to spend the
other major area that uses simulation is
for generating what I call plausible
animations these animations are not
required to be physically correct rather
their goal is to look reasonable to the
viewer just as we don't pick up on
reflection maps not having perfectly
correct reflections there are plenty of
errors that we don't notice or can
rationalize away though using physical
principles for the creation of effects
normally gives the most realistic
results for interactive rendering we
often have to make significant
simplifications
there are also simulators for phenomena
that are not based on physics for
example flocks of birds in flight
traffic in a city and crowds of people
walking inside a building are all
systems that can be simulated with some
basic rules the artist can also guide
the simulation as desired perhaps having
characters run towards a particular
location in jostle for position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
