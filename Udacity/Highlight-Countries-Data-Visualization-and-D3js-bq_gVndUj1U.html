what these selections actually represent
let's go back to our circles get the
exit selection on it again which
corresponds to every circle except year
nineteen thirty and call the d3 function
remove so this has the effect of finding
every element on the page through the
exit selection that doesn't belong there
and simply removing them if we run this
code and look at our map how it's been
updated it's hard to see since the
attendance was so small but there's a
single dot remaining here I'll try to
zoom in and you can see here it
corresponds to the nineteen thirty games
so our exit and remove have worked
correctly going back to our text editor
now that we've removed every element
that doesn't belong there let us add or
update any element that should change on
the page as you can see here much of the
code is identical to the code that drew
our initial circles and this is very
intentional because we want all the
circles representing the attendance of
games to look similarly as you can see
here for the circles new data bound
which is all the circles on the page
bound to new data filtered on our key
function we take the enter selection so
anything that's not currently on the
page we want to append a circle to the
page and then set all of the same
properties notice here that I didn't
include any of the calls to dot style
and I've abstracted all the styles of
circles up into CSS in the head of the
page rather than duplicate a lot of the
same code to change the styling on the
circles as well it's cleaner and easier
if we're going to be adding and removing
a bunch of circles on the page to not
have to specify every time that we want
the same styles the every other circle
head so now let's put all the code
together that we've both run in the
console and that I've shown here to
first remove the circles that don't
belong there and then add any circles
that need to be there as you can see
here we're simply removing any circles
in the exit selection and appending any
circles
the enter selection let's go back to our
console and just test that the circle
adding and removing works as we expect
and here we've stopped right before we
call the update function so let's see
what happens if we call update with the
year nineteen thirty as expected every
circle disappeared except for the tiny
tiny circle representing the year
nineteen thirty let's try to show the
most recent World Cup in Brazil passing
update of 2014 as you can see here the
1930 world cup was removed and we've
added the brazil world cup so it appears
that our update function is working
correctly given what i've shown you what
do you think happens if we try to update
a year in which there were no world cup
for example the year 1969</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
