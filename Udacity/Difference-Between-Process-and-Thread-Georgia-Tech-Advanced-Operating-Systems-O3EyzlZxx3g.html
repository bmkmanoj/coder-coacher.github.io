used in the context of an operating
system what is the difference between a
process and a thread an analogy will
help here let's say here is a morning
newspaper this morning newspaper lying
on the dining table is like a program in
memory no life I come to the dining
table pick up the newspaper in
particular the sports section of the
newspaper and start reading it by
starting to read the sports section of
the newspaper is akin to the operating
system giving life to the program by
starting to execute it so now there is
one life in the program that is one line
of control that is coursing through the
code and data structures of the program
this is what is called the thread of
execution through the program so we have
one thread of control that is coursing
through this program just as I'm reading
a section of the newspaper now my wife
comes along and being the more
responsible one in the family picks up
the business section and starts reading
it that's perfectly fine depending on
our interest I'm reading the sports
section
my wife is reading the business section
each is reading a different section of
the same newspaper now similarly we can
have multiple lives coursing through the
program each blazing a completely
different trail through the code and
data structures of the program now each
of this is a thread of control now could
there be a conflict between these
different threads of control sure both
my wife and I may want to read the same
section of the newspaper that's a
conflict similarly the threads that are
executing within the same program may
want to read or update the same data
structures these are the issues that the
operating system has to deal with and
this is what I meant when I said that
the operating system is the arbiter for
competing requests for resources now
generalizing it a program can have
several threads of control and each
thread of control may be coursing
through different sections of the
program and they could also be competing
for the same section of the program as
well as the same data structures in
order to manipulate thus a process is a
program plus the state of all the
threads that are executing within the
program just as a single newspaper could
be shared by me my wife and possibly my
children in a similar manner a program
may have multiple lives that are
coursing through it and each is a thread
of control and the process is the
program in execution meaning it is the
program plus the state of all the
threats that are currently executing
within this program for example if this
program is a web browser one thread in
this program could be fetching a page
that I've requested from the remote
server and another thread could be
painting the screen for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
