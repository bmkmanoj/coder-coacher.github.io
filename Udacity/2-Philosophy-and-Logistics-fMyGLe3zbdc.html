start I should give you some tips on how
to do well in the class step one is take
a look at the course readiness survey
it's the minimum CS and math 101 that I
think you need to even get started next
there are these videos the videos are
about building your intuition and like
other courses in the series there are
little quizzes sprinkled throughout I'd
advise you not to skip the quizzes
because I like to stick new concepts
there and beyond the videos there are
readings where the videos are about
building your intuition the readings are
about spelling out all the gory formal
details and you're gonna need those
details in order to do the mini projects
and the exams finally there are the mini
projects the mini projects are about
writing real code because you don't
really understand an algorithm or a data
structure until you've tried to
implement it yourself especially if
you're trying to understand something
about engineering trade-offs okay so
that's it for kind of logistics and
philosophy of the class with that fluffy
stuff out of the way let's talk hpz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
