understanding of how the overall file
system works
why don't we take a look at what one of
these AppLocker 'he's our sandboxes
looks like on the inside an app is
installed its sandbox is created with
several pre-made containers the bundle
container contains the application
itself or more specifically a directory
that holds the executive code and
resources like images and sound files or
whatever else is used by that code the
data container like its name might
suggest holds all the user and app data
within our three sub containers the
documents library and temp directories
temp is used for storing very temporary
data that doesn't need to be persisted
across launches so we're not going to be
talking about this directory in this
course documents in library the
directories you want to focus on
documents is where user data should go
and library is for non user data files
or files that you don't expose the user
both of these directories contained a
few standard sub directories such as
documents inbox library application
support library caches and several
others the caches directory is important
and we'll revisit it along with the
documents and library directories later
in this lesson
note that you can also create sub
directories of your own to better
organize your files at runtime and that
may also request access to additional
containers such as the iCloud container
so now that we have an idea of how the
file system works and what the sandboxes
inside the file system looks like we can
probably revisit our initial question
where does NS user defaults live if you
guessed within the data container you'd
be right
it lives right here within the data
container inside of library its actual
path looks something like this
the file info . my apt . mobile . p list
is the file that contains the saved NS
user defaults</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
