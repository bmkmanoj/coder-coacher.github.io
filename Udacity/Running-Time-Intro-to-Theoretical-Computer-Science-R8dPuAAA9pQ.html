be going over to running time today and
what it means for an algorithm to be
efficient or slow or difficult so we're
going to be going over a few problems
along those lines so when we go ahead
and just dive right in so let's say we
consider ourselves more practical
engineers than theoretical scientists so
we're somewhere over here maybe so we
don't really want to look at algorithm
code and try to figure out the running
times instead what we'd rather do is
implement the algorithms and then
measure them measure the running times
of the algorithms for just some random
instances let's say of various sizes and
see where things go so let's take a look
at the three algorithms call them alpha
beta and gamma in this table and we're
running them on different input sizes
and input size of 100 200 300 and 400
and we're showing their running times
now this isn't just for one run of each
of these algorithms let's say we're
running each of these algorithms a
million times on a random input of the
given size so we're running alpha a
million times on an input size of a
hundred on different randomly generated
inputs of size 100 and it's taking an
average of twenty-five and all these are
in minutes and similarly for an input
size of 200 we're running alpha a
million times on random inputs of size
two hundred and it's taking on average
317,000 minutes so you can see it grows
somewhat quickly we can ask a number of
questions about these three algorithms
the first question I'd like to ask is
what is the running time for each
algorithm alpha beta and gamma based on
the information in this table now you
might be a little bit confused here
because if alpha has linear running time
then it also has polynomial and
exponential running time since those are
worse than linear running time and
similarly if beta has polynomial running
time then it's also exponential running
time
but it's not linear running time then
don't worry too much about that just
give the lowest running time you can for
each algorithm and check which one
applies for each of the algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
