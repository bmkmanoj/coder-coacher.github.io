fourth piece and customer relationships
has a really interesting interaction
with these other three pieces
it basically says how do I get customers
how do I keep them and how do I grow
them and just like thinking about
distribution channels these are very
different for web mobile than they are
for physical channels but visually they
kind of look like this double-sided
funnel so let's just take a look at
quickly a web example in getting
customers you're going to be worrying
about how do i acquire them that is how
do I get them even to my website how do
I activate them that is how do I make
them do something and then later on
we'll see after I got them how do I keep
them around that is how do I not lose
them through attrition and churn and
then what can I do once I have customers
to make them spend more money or use my
product even more and so one of the
things we'll be thinking about is how do
I get keep and grow customers and just
like every other step you might have
hypothesis on day one but you're only
going to figure this out when you're out
of the building</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
