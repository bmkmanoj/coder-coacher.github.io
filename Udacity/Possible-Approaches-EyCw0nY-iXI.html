types of things for images how can we
actually dealer images that are actually
because of focus so here at two
different sets of example these are
actually approaches proposed by living
at all in 2007 basically the two methods
they proposed is one exploit prior
information on natural images look and
model the types of signal deconvolution
happen for natural images like this and
actually use that to figure out depth
discontinuities and discrimination that
will allow us to improve the convolution
and also depth estimation so you know
natural images are scenes like this
unnatural images would be you know
random noise types of things the other
method and this is the one will actually
focus on in this lecture is basically
come up with different patterns and they
basically use these patterns on the lens
itself so make a defocused pattern that
is known in this case it's the aperture
itself but change the defocus pattern to
have some sort of a characteristic like
this and use that to discriminate where
the defocus is differently for different
planes of the focus planes in an image
again we'll talk about this in a lot
more detail and the idea really comes up
is that what we want to do is come up
with a coded aperture an aperture that
would have different characteristics
like this and you can put this inside a
lens before the image is formed amount
of light that goes in through the lens
to the sensor if you can put this in we
can actually perhaps quantify the D
focus on the sensor and that will
actually let us know how to deke involve
it based on the fact that we are
actually quantified with the focus plane
