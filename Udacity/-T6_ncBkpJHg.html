movies website much like this one now if
you were to make this based on what
we've been doing thus far what we would
do is start with an empty programming
file and we would call it something like
movies pie now since the movie has a lot
of data associated with it like the
movies title its storyline we would add
that to our program also we would want
to do things with our movies like show
the movies trailer or show or print all
of the movies information so we would
add those functions to our code as well
so far so good
so further imagine that we want to run
this program and we want to play a
movies trailer well which movies trailer
to make that work we would have to
provide the show trailer function some
information or arguments like this in
this case we are saying hey play toy
stories YouTube URL that seems
manageable enough now let's try to print
out a movie's information well which
movies information again we would have
to supply some sort of information or
arguments to the show info function
arguments like the movies title its
storyline release date rating YouTube
URL director box office etc now I don't
know about you but this function show
info is already getting too convoluted
for me imagine what happens if we have
to supply more information to it like
the movies cast or the movies reviews
what we really want to do is define a
template for our movie and record all of
the data that needs to go into that
template data like the movie's title its
storyline and functions like show
trailer and show information and then
simply say hey Toy Story is a movie and
so is avatar and then have the ability
to say show me Toy Story is trailer or
show me avatars information no arguments
necessary now one way of doing this just
by using functions is to take the
template that we are defined and make
multiple copies of it so we could make a
copy of this template and call it Toy
Story pie
and make another copy of this template
and call it avatar by now we will be
able to say things like Toy Story
show trailer and avatar show info now
this doesn't seem like a very smart
solution to me imagine what happens if
we have to add more pieces of data to
our template or if we have to rename one
of our functions say from show trailer
to play trailer if that happens we will
have to make those changes in each and
every copy that we make this doesn't
seem like a very smart thing to do so
what we really need is a way of making
copies of a template without having
multiple files we need the ability to
define a template for something like we
did for movies and then be able to say
hey Toy Story is a type of that template
and so is avatar avatar is also a type
of that template we need something new
and that new thing in programming is
called a class so what are classes and
how do you use them let's find out in
the next few lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
