Gaussian that is somewhat
counterintuitive you'd think if this is
your initial guess this is your
measurement probability you really don't
know where you are and you should pick a
very right Gaussian but the truth is our
new Sigma square is obtained independent
of the means it's this formula over here
now because both means are the same this
resolves to 1 over 2 over Sigma Square
and that's the same as Sigma square over
2 which means the new variance square is
half of the old one that makes it a
narrower Gaussian so this one the green
one here that's the most P key is indeed
the correct answer this is very
counterintuitive but now we understand
why and I hope if you comfortable with
the fact that we've actually gotten more
information about the location which is
manifest by a more focused estimates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
