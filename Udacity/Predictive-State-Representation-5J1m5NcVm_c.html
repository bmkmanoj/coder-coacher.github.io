cover in in pom DP land is you know a
line of work that that I am somewhat
fond of that is called predictive state
representation so let me let me say a
little bit about the motivation behind
studying this and we'll talk a little
bit about the representation itself but
we're not going to talk much about
algorithms that actually make use of
this there there's a literature if you
want to dive in alright so so here's the
basic premise of this this line of work
so we talked about pom DP so pom DPS
when we're moving around in a pom DP
we're tracking the belief state which is
a distribution over States right right
so here's the thing the states are not
observable right right so how can we
ever hope to learn in a pom DP when we
never actually get to see these
underlying states they're never observed
so you could ask yourself do they even
exist or they just kind of useful
fictions of our imagination there's
nothing that we can ever do to test hey
was this the state we were actually in
the answer is no I mean if we're
learning in a pond EP we're just
creating this notion of States to
provide some structure to the
observations that we've seen is this
like a tree in the forest thing yeah
yeah if a pom DP is solved in a forest
does anybody know whether or not they
exist and the answer is neat now I think
you're right I mean we're making this
stuff up anyway right yeah and in the
case that somebody gives us a pom DP and
says would you please plan in this
that's it's a reasonable representation
to work with but if you're in a
reinforcement learning setting you never
get to see these underlying states you
can never actually collect statistics
about them in fact most of the good work
that I've seen that that uses pom DPS
they don't learn the pom teepee they
actually send you know I'm gonna say
grad students out into the field to
measure underlying states and then
measure the the observation function
they actually kind of instrument the
world to build the pom DP and then they
can act in the pom VP successfully later
but it's just there's really no good way
to learn about the states or even that
they're real even that they're real ok
so now that you've blown my mind so the
idea of a predictive state
representation or PSR is that the thing
that we're going to use for
representation isn't going to be
probability distributions over these
possibly fictional States but instead
they're going to be probabilities of the
outcomes of future predictions so like I
am in a state
it's about an 80% chance it's gonna rain
tomorrow okay which doesn't require an
actual state well in that booms maybe
not a great example so let me let me
give a more concrete example to kind of
ground this idea out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
