get the service worker to update is a
bit of a pain during development but
thankfully there are ways to make it
easier I'm going to make a change to the
console log in the service worker and
then back in the page I'm going to hit
refresh now there's a new service worker
waiting you can tell the difference here
is the active service worker has this
red icon and the waiting one is I don't
know is that teal you can tell I'm not a
designer it's waiting because the tab is
still using the active version but
rather than close this tab on navigate
it to another origin I'm going to reload
the page while holding shift this loads
the page but bypasses the serviceworker
this behavior is part of the service
worker spec so it should work in any
browser that supports service workers
this is handy for two reasons one it's a
quick way to test changes that are
unrelated to the service worker such as
minus CSS changes and two because this
tab is no longer controlled by the
service worker it lets the waiting
service worker take over we can see this
in devtools the teal service worker has
progressed to active now if i refresh
normally the request goes through the
new service worker and we get the
updated log oh and now it's probably a
good time to talk about this error file
exists thing in the console there that's
just chrome saying it's checked a
service worker and there were no changes
showing an error for this is a bug um
but it isn't breaking anything hopefully
this blog will be fixed by the time you
go through this course so shift refresh
is an easier way to get updates but
chrome devtools has an even easier way
in the sources tab check out this little
service worker panel here there's an
option called force update on page load
this changes the service worker
lifecycle to be developer-friendly
rather than user friendly in this mode
when you hit refresh rather than
refreshing the page it fetches a service
worker trees as a new version whether
it's changed or not and lets it become
active straight away and then the page
refreshes that means I can make a change
to the console log say yo everyone and
then back in the page hit refresh and I
get those changes straight away no shift
refresh no
closing tabs this change in behavior
only happens while devtools is open but
it makes viewing quick changes really
easy however we need to bear in mind
it's not the same lifecycle users will
be getting later in the course we'll
look at optimizing the user experience
but first let's do some more exciting
things with the serviceworker in the
next chapter will look at hijacking
requests and doing our own thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
