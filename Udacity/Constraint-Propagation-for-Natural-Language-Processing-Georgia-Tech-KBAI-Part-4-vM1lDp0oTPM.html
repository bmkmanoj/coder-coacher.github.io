colorless green ideas sleep furiously
you and I can quickly recognize that
this sentence is grammatically correct
even as it is semantically meaningless
how do we do it consider this mini
grammar this is a small subset of
English language grammar consisting of
just three simple rules this sentence
could go into a non phrase ordered by a
verb phrase a noun phrase can be
optional objectives followed by a noun
or a pronoun the square bracket here
means optional a word phrase composed of
a verb followed by optional at work the
variables in this particular sentence
are the words the values we assign to
them or electrical categories like verb
adjective noun and pronoun if we can
make a pass free for this that assign
values to these variables in a way that
is consistent with this grammar then
this particular sentence is
grammatically correct let us try to make
a pass 3 for the sentence a sentence can
be a non phrasal verb phrase so we may
say this is a noun phrase and this is a
verb phrase of course at this particular
point we do not know where we should
make this demarcations what should go
into the non phrase what should go into
the word phrase well know whether or not
this demarcation is correct depending
upon whether or not this non face and
web phrase meet the lower level lexical
categories so let us look at colorless
green ideas we know that a noun phrase
can go into one of our objectives
followed by a noun or pronoun so we can
look at a lexicon and know that ideas
are a noun so we say this is a noun we
can look at a lexicon der tells us that
colorless and green are objectives and
so colorless and green our objectives
here we have satisfied this part of the
constraint so I'm ready for the verb
phrase a word phrase can be composed of
a verb followed by one or more optional
adverbs we can look at a lexicon and
sleep as a verb and furiously is an
adverb so we have satisfied the
constraints for this particular part
because we have satisfied the
constraints we know the top-level
demarcation of this as a non present
this as the verb phrase was correct so
the processing is not only top down here
it also has a bottom-up component and
this way we were able to decide that
this particular sentence is
grammatically correct because it satisfy
the constraints of a mini grammar know
that we have used knowledge of
constraints the method of constraint
propagation both for visual processing
and
language processing this this method is
very general proposition 2 main
independent once we have done constraint
propagation to derive the past three for
the sentence then we can do additional
processing we can use this past three to
support semantic analysis to build an
understanding a semantic understanding
of the sentence similar individual
processing once we have used the
constraints were doing line labeling and
recognize the surfaces and their
orientations we can then go on further
and recognize the object in its 3d form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
