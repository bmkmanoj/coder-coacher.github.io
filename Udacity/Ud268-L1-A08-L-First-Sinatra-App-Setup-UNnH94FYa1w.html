run your very first Sinatra application
by the end of this lesson and well I'm
pretty sure the end of this lesson is
quickly approaching so we better get on
with it here so rather than starting
from scratch with a completely empty
file we're going to start you off with
the simple but complete app that you'll
be able to download and get running on
your own machine we're doing this for a
few reasons one it can take a while to
get something going in Sinatra from
scratch and two there are some important
concepts we need to cover around how you
start up it's not your app and how you
interact with it so the first step is to
get our starter app on your own machine
so you'll need to clone this repository
using the provided link below so click
the clone or download button and then
find this clipboard button to copy the
URL to your clipboard now back in your
terminal run git clone and paste the URL
you just copied now that we have the app
downloaded let's make sure we have all
the dependencies installed so we need to
change directories into the newly
created folder and run bundle install
this will go and fetch the Sinatra gem
and any of its own dependencies as well
and if for some reason you don't have
bundler installed on your own machine
you can run gem install bundler first
and then run bundle install you can see
here among other things it installed
Sinatra version 1.4 point 74 s so before
we start up the app let's quickly take a
look at the code itself in our text
editor so I've opened up the contents of
the directory in sublime text so we have
a standard gem file that includes
Sinatra we have a readme there's a
public directory that contains things
like our logo for the site and a
stylesheet but the heart of this
application is the app darby file so
this is the file that requires a Sinatra
gem itself and this is a file that
contains all of our application logic
look at how simple and clean this is and
that's really the beauty of Sinatra is
that it allows us to create these web
applications with just a few lines of
code so let's go ahead and try and start
this application so running a Sinatra
application is just like running any
other Ruby app you execute a file using
the Ruby command in this case we need to
execute the ruby file that contains all
the sinatra logic which we just saw app
dot RB so in your terminal run Ruby app
dot RB usually when you execute a ruby
file the code runs and then it finishes
and your terminal goes back to normal
however when you start up a Sinatra app
the server starts running and it keeps
running until you turn it off so you've
started a server that is continually
listening for incoming requests and you
can't run other commands in this
terminal window until you turn it off so
if you do want to turn off the app you
can type ctrl C or ctrl D and things
should go back to normal there we go and
to start it back up we just run Ruby app
Darby ok congratulations you've started
up your very first Sinatra web
application you officially have a server
running on your machine now all we have
to do is figure out how we make a
request and actually interact with the
web app and that's coming up next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
