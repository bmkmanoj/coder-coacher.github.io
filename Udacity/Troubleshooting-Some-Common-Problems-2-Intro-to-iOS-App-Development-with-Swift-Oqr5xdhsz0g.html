students had trouble while playing and
stopping audio I want to address those
concerns in this video now here in my
place sounds view controller I have
actions for play slow audio play fast
audio and stop audio I'm gonna run this
project and see if it works here I will
play the movie quote slowly and then
fast and then I will stop all audio take
a listen
black with lacquer box now you may have
noticed that when I press any one of
these two buttons while the audio is
already playing the playback starts not
from the beginning but from when I
actually pressed any one of these two
buttons you can keep that functionality
if you'd like although if you want to
start the audio from the beginning you
can use this property called current
time and set it to zero let me do that
in both slow and fast okay let me run
this project one more time now this time
the audio will start from the beginning
my mom always said live with lack a box
of chocolates cool now one final thing
to notice here is that the code for both
the slow and the fast actions is looking
really similar to each other here is an
opportunity for you to put the common
code in a new function and then call
that new function from both the play
slow audio and the play fast audio
actions alright if you have any more
questions about how to make these two
buttons work ask those questions on the
discussion forum we are here to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
