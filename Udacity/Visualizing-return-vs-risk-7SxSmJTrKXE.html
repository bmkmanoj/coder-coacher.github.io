over and over again there's no reward
without risk and we often want to
consider multiple stocks together and
evaluate their risk versus return so one
way we can do that is plot them on a
scatter plot where each dot here
represents one stock so risk is along
this axis return is along this axis so
for instance this stock here has higher
risk but about the same return as this
stock and then for comparison this stock
here has shown historically about the
same risk as this stock but it's got a
much higher return now we can build a
portfolio by combining multiple assets
like the various stocks have got plotted
here and weighting each asset by a
particular weight that represents its
allocation within the portfolio so each
stock has a weight and when combined all
together we end up with a portfolio that
has properties of each of the stocks
it's typically got a risk somewhere in
the middle there and they return
somewhere in the middle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
