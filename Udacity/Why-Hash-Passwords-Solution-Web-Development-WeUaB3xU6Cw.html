is for knowing everyone's passwords
that's actually correct that's um
there's no reason why you as a website
owner should you don't know your users
passwords or maybe there are a few
reasons but no very good ones and this
you know eliminates a whole you know
issue that you have to worry about
because people often use the same
password for many websites this is also
correct answer I wish people didn't and
you may think well it's not my problem
but if you're accepting users passwords
you do have a bit of a moral obligation
to keep them safe because no matter how
loud you yell and scream people are
going to continue to use the same
password or lousy passwords for many
websites if the database is compromised
the passwords are reasonably safe this
is also true they're not completely safe
of course you know they have your
database now and they know what those
hashes are they can figure out the
passwords in some potentially huge
amount of time but it's a lot safer than
just giving them the passwords and if
you don't you will regret it this is
also true and I'm going to share a tale
of me goofing on this and how much I
regret it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
