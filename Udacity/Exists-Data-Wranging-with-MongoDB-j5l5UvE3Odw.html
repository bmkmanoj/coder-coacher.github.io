operators I'm going to switch over and
use the Mongo shell for some of this
this is a console application that ships
with the database and it provides a
great interface for exploring mongo DB
query language so the first thing that I
need to do is switch into the right
database which I've already done here
with use examples now I'm just going to
do a find against the whole collection
we see a whole bunch of documents scroll
by okay so as we've discussed some
documents will contain fields that
others do not in our cities collection
for many CDs especially those that are
less important or simply smaller much of
the detail is missing for example a
small town in the US state of Iowa where
I used to live it's going to have much
less detail then say Berlin London or
other major cities I'm going to be
allows you to query based on the
structure of information that's in the
documents as well as their values so
let's take a look at an example so I
happen to know that relatively few
documents have a field for government
type it's useful to know what type of
government a particular city has but
it's only the larger cities that tend to
have this field MongoDB provides an
operator called exists that allows us to
retrieve documents based on whether or
not documents contain a particular field
and the value for exists is whether we
want documents that contain the field or
those that don't in this case I want to
find documents that do have a government
type field rope and you see what
happened there is I forgot to close the
query document so let's go back and do
that and there we go and let's do a
count here and of the 20,000 documents
in this collection a relatively small
number contain this field we can do the
inverse query and see we get a much
larger number let's take a look at one
of these documents here i'm going to use
pretty to make it more human readable ok
so let's go back to the documents that
actually contain this field and again
we'll make them pretty ok so this
happens to be the city of Lansing
Michigan and you can see there's quite a
bit of detail here ok now what we can do
is contrast this with documents that
don't have this field and it just
happens to be the case that this
document is conveniently for example
purposes much more sparse
so the exists operator allows us to do
queries and ask some questions about the
structure of a document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
