this is a picture of the tracking of
Andrew Blake's daughter and the first
question is what is this state alright
and the state or the object that was to
be tracked was a hand initialized
contour of the head on the left here you
see a bunch of contours okay in fact
there's even one that's up here alright
those contours are the contours
represented by each or many of the
particles the top particles right and so
for example you can actually talk about
the mean state as being the sort of
average of the particles but that
doesn't really tell you what it is what
do you mean you know the state of a
contour well in fact what they did is
they drew a contour and they said
because that's not a parameter that's a
shape and they said let's represent the
state of that contour by an affine
deformation okay remember affine affine
is it's a three point two three point
mapping takes how many parameters it's
six parameters okay
translation rotation scale and shear
depending upon how you count the I mean
it's six and you can sort of divide them
up anyway so the idea is that each
particle represents a six dimensional
vector so by the way that means our
particles are living in a six
dimensional space and the bigger the the
number of dimensions the more particles
you need to sort of fill up that space
in fact it doesn't grow so nicely does
it right I mean if I go from two
dimensions as the three dimensions right
if I had a hundred particles before if I
wanted to have the same density I would
now need a thousand particles right it
goes ekit grows exponentially in terms
of the number of dimensions so for a
fine we're gonna need six and as I said
each of the particles represents that
here by the way is one of the videos and
one of the questions you might ask is
well where do you get the dynamics where
do you get the dynamics well there are a
couple of things you can do the easiest
thing to do is to cheat alright so the
reason we're using dynamics here is that
the girl is jumping up and down in front
of a cluttered background so to keep
track of where our head is is kind of a
difficult tracking problem
that's why we're doing all this work to
begin with that's why we're using
particles but when would tracking be
easy how about if she was jumping around
in front of a green screen or a white
background okay or in fact even easier
suppose you put her in a totally black
turtleneck sweater and you put her in
front of a black screen kind of like
that thing by the way Megan doesn't let
me wear black shirts because I'll
disappear
but the point of my disappearing is all
you would see would be my floating head
which would be kind of creepy
but it would be very easy tracking so
you could have somebody jump around with
their floating head track it very easily
and measure the dynamics so one way of
getting dynamics is to sort of cheat and
get it from an easier system and I think
for a bunch of the stuff they did in
Khan sation that's what they did they
had an easier problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
