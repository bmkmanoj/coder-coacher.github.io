in customer segments besides jobs to be
done and pain and gain and that is who's
the customer that well gee I thought we
just define the customer it's the
archetype is the persona but sometimes
who's the customer in context is really
what we need to know in corporations
it's pretty easy to understand that you
might have someone who uses the product
but they might not be the person who
pays for the product so there might be
someone up here the payer let's give
them a fancy name and call them the
economic buyer so we might be buying
software for accounting to use but it
might be the chief financial officer who
has to sign off for that and in between
this process in a large company you
might have people who influence the
decisions you might have people who
actually recommend who the vendors
should be you might have a
decision-maker who's the head of the
department but he still needs to pass
off the final purchase to the chief
financial officer and surprisingly if
you spend enough time selling to
companies you might have saboteurs and
saboteurs in a company are individuals
or organizations whose jobs feel
threatened if a new piece of software or
new process or new organization comes in
place and so in complicated
business-to-business sales you really
need to know the archetypes for each one
of these even though you might think oh
all I need to know is about my user and
then you might go okay well then all we
need to know is about the buyer as we'll
see you later you actually need to
understand archetypes for all now if you
were kind of rolling your eyes going
well I don't sell to businesses I just
saw the consumers this isn't relevant to
me I want you to think of the case of
selling entertainment software to teens
well think about it you kind of say well
the user role that's pretty simple
that's that's the team how hard can that
be well if they don't have a job the
economic buyer are their parents and the
influencers and recommenders maybe their
friends and the decision maker depending
on your family might be mom or dad or
the kid or somebody else in between and
so when we think about business to
consumer sales you also need to start
thinking
about is the user different than the
payer the last example is a personal one
I was buying a car and I thought how
simple could that be I was the customer
well Kendall did I know having two
teenage daughters that that really
wasn't the case because when I started
talking about my car or potential car my
daughter said Ted you can't buy that
type of car we wouldn't be caught dead
in it and I looked at him said well the
car is not for you they said oh we just
won't even be riding in it and they said
well is it if you buy a car you can't
get that color and this conversation
went on for a long time until finally we
were able to make a decision and I
realized that the final decision-maker
in our household was my wife</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
