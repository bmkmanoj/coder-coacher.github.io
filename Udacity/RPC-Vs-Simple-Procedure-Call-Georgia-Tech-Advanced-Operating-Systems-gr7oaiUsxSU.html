called works there is a caller you have
a process in which all the functions are
being compiled together and linked
together to make an executable and so
when a caller makes a call to the
colleague it makes a call passing the
arguments on the stack the colleague can
execute the procedure and then return to
the caller so this is your simple
procedure call and the important thing
is that all of the interaction that I'm
showing you here is happening at compile
time all of these things are being done
at compile time now let's see what
happens with remote procedure call you
know in principle and remote procedure
call looks exactly like this picture
that you have a caller and a colleague
so the caller is making a call executing
a procedure and returning so that's what
is going on in animal procedure call but
under the cover let's see what's going
on when you're using remote procedure
call when the caller makes this call it
really is a trap into the kernel I call
a trap into the kernel and what the
kernel does is it validates the call and
it copies the arguments of the call into
kernel buffers from the client address
space the kernel then locates the server
procedure that needs to be executed
copies the arguments that it has
buffered in a kernel buffer into the
address space of the server and once it
has done that it schedules the server to
run the particular procedure so that's
what's going on in this in this
direction at this point the server
procedure actually starts executing
using the arguments of the call and
performs a function that was requested
by the client when the server procedure
is done with execution of the procedure
it needs to return the results of this
procedure execution back to the client
and in order to do that it's going to
tap into the kernel through the return
trap that the server is experiencing in
order to return the results back to the
client and what the kernel does at this
point is to copy the results from the
address space of the server into kernel
buffers and then it copy
the results from the kernel buffer into
the clients address space and now at
this point we've completed sending the
results back to the client so the kernel
can then reschedule the client who can
then receive the results and go on in
its merry way of executing whatever it
was doing so that's essentially what's
going on under the cover so even though
the picture is so clean up here that a
client is making a call and you get the
results and you can continue with
whatever it was doing in reality what is
going on under the cover is fairly
complex and more importantly all of
these actions are happening at runtime
as opposed to what I mentioned about a
procedure call where everything is
happening at compile time all of these
actions are happening at runtime and
that is one of the fundamental sources
of performance hit that an RPC system is
going to take in the fact that
everything is being done at the time of
the call in particular if you want to
analyze all the overheads that or the
work that needs to get done at runtime
there are two traps the first trap is a
call trap the other trap is the return
trap there are two traps and there are
two context switches so first context
which is when the kernel switches from
the client to the server to run the
server procedure and when the server
procedure is done with its execution of
the server procedure it has to
reschedule the client run again so two
traps two context switches and one
procedure execution that's the work that
is being done by the runtime system in
order to execute this remote procedure
call so what are all the sources of
overhead now well first of all when this
call trap happens the kernel has to
validate the access whether this client
is allowed to make this procedure call
or not that validation has to happen and
then it has to copy the arguments from
the clients address space into kernel
buffers and potentially if you look at
this picture there could be multiple
copies that are going to happen in order
to do this exchange between the client
of the server and then there is the
scheduling of the server in order to run
the the server code and then there is a
context switch overhead
talked about the explicit and implicit
costs of doing conflict switches there
is a context which overhead that is
associated between but in when we go
from the client of the server and back
again to the client from the server and
of course dispatching a thread on the
processor itself is also time which is
explicit cost of scheduling so before we
discuss how we can reduce the overheads
in this remote procedure call when the
clients and the server's happen to be on
the same machine
let me prime the pump with the quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
