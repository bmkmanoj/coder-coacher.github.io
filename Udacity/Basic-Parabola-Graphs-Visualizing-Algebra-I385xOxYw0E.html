y equals x squared now we can tell that
the center are really the vertex of this
parabola is at the origin 0 comma 0 the
parabola opens in the upward direction
and it has an a value of 1 the a value
is simply the number that's in front of
the x squared term since it's not listed
we know that the coefficient is a 1
another interesting part about parabolas
is that they're symmetric if there's a
point on the left hand side of the graph
then there's another point equally
distant away from its axis of symmetry
on the right hand side of the graph for
example we have the point negative 3 9
then on the other side of the graph we
have the point 3 comma 9 we also have
the point negative 2 4 and on the right
hand side of the graph we also have the
point 2 comma 4 2 units in the
horizontal direction right and then 4
units vertically up the lowest point are
the turning point for our parabola is
the vertex it's at the origin 0 comma 0
now we could make an X and Y table and
create a table of values to get our
graph but an easier way to get a couple
points on the graph is to look at the a
value we're gonna zoom in on this
parabola we can find the basic shape of
this parabola by looking at the a value
the points to the left and to the right
of the vertex will be exactly one unit
above the current point so we move one
unit left and one unit up we move one
unit up since the a value is 1 and then
to get the symmetric point we move in
the opposite direction one unit right
and one unit up so we can see that we
have a point of negative 1 comma 1 and a
point of 1 comma 1 let's make another
graph and see some comparisons for the
graph y equals 2x squared we also get a
parabola this parabola X is at the
origin it's still 0 0 but what's
different is the a value now that a
value is 2 so to get the basic shape of
this graph
we'll move one unit right in one unit
left from the vertex
then we'll go a units up in this case
two units so one unit left and two units
up this gives us our first point at
negative 1 2 then we can move one unit
right and 2 units up to give ourselves
another point at 1 comma 2 and here's a
third parabola y equals 3 x squared
notice that the turning point are the
vertex for this parabola is still at 0 0
at the origin to find other points on
this purple parabola we're going to use
our a value we can move one unit left
and 3 units up this gives us a
coordinate of negative 1 comma 3 to find
another point on the graph we'll go the
opposite way we'll go one unit right and
this time 3 units up this gives us a
point of 1 comma 3 the a value is always
a quick way to get one point that is
still left of the vertex and one point
that is to the right of the vertex
whenever parabola is in the form y
equals notice two that is the a value
gets bigger our parabola stretches
vertically or in other words it gets
more narrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
