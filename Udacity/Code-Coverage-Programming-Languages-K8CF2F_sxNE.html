but let's look at testing from another
angle let's say this is the program or
the thing that we're considering testing
we want to test our JavaScript
interpreter and we're going to feed it
this factorial definition and this call
to document right and by thinking hard
about the problem we know the answer we
should get is a hundred and twenty five
times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 5
factorial here's the quiz let's say this
is our test case and that's the input
we're comparing against I want to know
which parts of the program we gain
confidence about so here I've written 6
important parts of our JavaScript
interpreter handling function calls
handling environment lookups for
variable values handling string
constants like hello local variable
declarations like VAR temp equals 3
assignment statements like z equals 2
and binary operations like addition and
what I want to know is if this is our
test input and we're comparing the
answer to 120 which of these features in
our interpreter will be tested if
something isn't tested we can't hope to
find a bug in it as a hint another way
of looking at this problem is to imagine
let's say that our code for function
calls totally didn't work would we get
120 if the answer is no then we're
testing function calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
