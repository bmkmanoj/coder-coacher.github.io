in January of 2014 with the ultimate
goal of creating a more accessible
master's program we wanted everyone who
wants and deserves at Georgia Tech
Masters and si s to be able to get one
we wanted to tear down the obstacles
that usually prevent people from
participating in a program like this one
and this program has really allowed us
to do so we've removed the obstacle of
geography we have students from every
state and from seventy seven different
countries we've removed the obstacle of
availability most of our students are
completing the program while still
holding down full-time jobs and managing
their families and other obligations
we've removed the obstacle of capacity
our online classes and old far more
students than we could ever handle
in-person and perhaps most importantly
we've greatly reduced the obstacle of
cost this program costs a fraction of
the amount of traditional on-campus
program I actually live here in Atlanta
and I work just a couple of blocks from
campus I participate in the online
program because of all of these benefits
it's much more affordable than a
traditional on-campus program and more
importantly I don't have to take two
years off of work to get a master's here
we've made enormous efforts to make this
program accessible because we wanted to
reach a broader audience of students but
in making the firm accessible something
interesting has happened because you can
complete the program without taking time
off work it's attracted executives
scientists people and incredibly
prominent positions in research and
industry from around the world because
the cost of the program is so low it's
attractive people that don't view the
program simply as a career investment it
attracts people who are here solely
because they love to learn and because
we can take a much larger number of
students the program has attracted an
incredibly diverse population of people
from career programmers to people
working in completely different domains
who think that Java is coffee from
Indonesia and Python is a snake in
Africa the accessibility of this program
has allowed it to attract an incredible
population of students and it's the
student ownership and investment into
the program that has truly made it
something special I love my job because
I get to work with some of the most
engaged curious and passionate students
I've ever met and they'll be your
classmates in the om SES program you
quite likely learn more from each other
than you ever will from us and that's
what makes this program truly special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
