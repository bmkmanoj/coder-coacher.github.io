values can at most be X so if the
difference in value between B and a is
larger than x value of a divided by X
and the value of B divided by X would
round down two different numbers so
that's why we know the amount of value
lost and each mistake that we make is
actually smaller than X and that is a
very cool thing to know because with
these three things knowing how many
objects can be at most in an optimum
solution how many mistakes we can have
made and having quantified how much
value we have lost in each mistake
allows us to quantify the overall
mistake that we can have made at most
and I call this the maximum value lost
as opposed to an optimum solution and
that maximum value is of course well
there's at most n objects in the optimum
solution that means we can make at most
n mistakes and each of those mistakes
costs us less than X so the maximum
value that we can lose overall by
rounding down is smaller than n times X
and of course is the absolute error that
the algorithm can make by this rounding
down technique so now let's figure out
the relative error here and the relative
error since knapsack is a maximization
problem is of course the value of an
optimum solution divided by the value of
an approximate solution so let's just
call the value of the optimum solution V
opt + opt stands for optimal here and in
that case we can write the approximate
solution as V opt minus n times X now
this is not the precise value of the
approximate solution but it's a bound
for the approximate solution so we know
it cannot get any worse than that so but
to be precise here of course then we'll
have to write it like this year because
we know that the approximate solution
will have at least this value actually
it will always be bigger because we have
a strict smaller than here so we should
more precisely even write it like this
so it's smaller than V opt / v up minus
n times X now we can simply rewrite this
as 1 plus n times X over V up to minus n
times X we know something about we opt
because the value of an optimum solution
can at most be the value of all objects
combined and we call that number V so we
can rewrite this as 1 plus n times X
over V minus n times X now let's have a
closer look at X how did we define X
well we
said that X was equal to V over n times
1 minus C where C was some number
between 0 and 1 so if we plug the value
of x into this equation here what we get
is 1 plus V times 1 minus c / v minus V
times 1 minus C which means that we see
urged simply cancel out and you get 1
plus 1 minus C over 1 minus 1 plus C
which is the same as 1 over C so I
didn't tell you about see earlier but
what we just found out is that the
approximation factor of our algorithm is
actually 1 over C and you'll remember
that the running time was also depended
on sea so we already figured this one
out right it was o of N squared over 1
minus C so a good approximation would be
to set C close to 1 because then the
relative error becomes almost one but in
return and you see that in the running
time here the running time actually
becomes very large because if C is close
to 1 then you get a very small
denominator here which means that the
overall running time since it's a
fraction depending on this gets very
large but if you're happy with a and I'm
going to just call it bad approximation
then C can actually be smaller than 1 C
will always be larger than zero so it'll
always be a positive number but it could
be you know 0.5 0.2 or even smaller what
will then happen is if C is smaller than
1 so it's a very tiny fraction well then
actually this part here in the
denominator will be very close to 1 so
the running time is very good but this
fraction here will actually increase so
in return for getting a better running
time you get a relative error that is
much worse and this is exactly the
principle behind the pee test so we're
trading in the quality of the
approximation factor which is this
fraction year one over C against running
time more running time means we can get
a better approximation factor a worse
approximation factor in return will mean
that the algorithm runs faster so this
is already pretty amazing now one last
detail here as you'll notice the running
time of the approximation algorithm is
actually pulling no merely dependent on
C which is why this pts is sometimes
also referred to as a
fully polynomial time approximation
scheme or FP test for the majority of
polynomial time approximation schemes
the running time actually depends
exponentially on the approximation
factor that you want to achieve but this
is something for a more advanced course
I still sometimes find it mind-boggling
that knapsack is np-complete meaning
that in terms of intractability knapsack
is likely to be just as hard to solve as
nastier problems such as sat or click so
approximation I think shows very well
that even within NP completeness there's
a broad spectrum of difficulty if you
will so some of the most difficult
problems to approximate appear to be
clique and independent set and then in
the middle of the spectrum we have
problems like vertex cover and then we
have problems which have AP tests or
even a fully polynomial time
approximation schemes such as knapsack
all of these problems here are
np-complete but some of them can be
approximated with no constant factor at
all others have algorithms that if you
don't look closely could almost be
mistaken for being polynomial of course
all of this is still under the
assumption that P does not equal NP if P
equals NP then all of these problems
here would be polynomial-time solvable
anyway now that we have looked at
approximation what else is there that
you could try to tackle NP complete
problems next time will be basically
poking around meaning that we'll be
looking at how randomization and random
algorithms could maybe help us tackle
these problems here as well so see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
