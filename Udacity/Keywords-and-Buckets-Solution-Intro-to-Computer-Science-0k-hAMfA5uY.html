third one and the fifth one and this is
why a hash table is such a great advance
over the linear index is that we can
double the number of keywords and double
the number of buckets and the lookup
time stays the same with the linear
index if we double the number of
keywords for each lookup we need to go
through that loop once for each keyword
if the keyword was near the end or one
that wasn't in the table the time to
look up the keyword would double as we
double the number of keywords with a
hash table if we also doubled the number
of buckets when we double the number of
keywords well then the number of
keywords in each bucket stays the same
so we're dividing the keywords evenly
between buckets so this is the number
the number of keywords per bucket is the
number of keywords divided by the number
of buckets if we double both that number
stays approximately the same the time to
look up only depends on the number of
keywords per bucket the time to find the
bucket is very fast right we just need
to run the hash function find that
element of the list both of those don't
depend on the size of the list how long
it takes to do that
and then we have to look through that
bucket the size of the bucket we have to
look through each element in the bucket
one at a time so if we keep the number
of keywords per bucket the same the
lookup time stays essentially the same
so that's the great property that hash
tables have if we double the number of
buckets as we double the number of
keywords they expected lookup time
doesn't change for the other
possibilities well if we double the
number of keywords and keep the same
number of buckets that's gonna get
slower because the number of keywords
per bucket will approximately double so
it's gonna take about twice as long for
each lookup if we keep the same number
of keywords but double the number of
buckets well then it's gonna actually
get faster we'll have the same number of
keywords double the number of buckets so
this value will be approximately half
what it was before they expected lookup
time will be about half what it was
before we doubled the number of buckets
if we have the number of keywords
keeping the same number of buckets well
that has essentially the same effect the
average number of keywords per bucket
will be half what it was before so the
expected lookup time will be about half
what it was and finally if we have both
well that's going to keep the ratio of
the same so the expected lookup time
will be about the same so that's why
these two are the correct answers that
those are expected to leave the lookup
time essentially unchanged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
