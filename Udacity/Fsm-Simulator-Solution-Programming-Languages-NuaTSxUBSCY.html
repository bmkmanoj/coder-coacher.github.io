answer together to see if there's an
outgoing edge we'll just check to see if
the tuple current comma letter is in
edges if so our destination state can be
obtained by just looking up the tuple
current comma letter images we've
already processed letter the zeroth
element of string so we want to peel off
the zeroth character retaining only the
rest of them for example if the input
was a a a 1 1 1 we've used the a so now
we want it to be just a a 1 1 1 and now
we just call ourselves recursively call
finite state machine simulation on the
remaining string starting from the
destination node and the edges and
accepting states are unchanged otherwise
we fall off the finite state machine and
return false all right the moment of
truth we want to print out this answer
ho just as we expected a a a 1 1 1 is
accepted by this string what if I try to
mix it up and make it something like a 1
a 1 a 1 this should not be accepted by
our finite state machine and it is not
the output changes to false how about
the empty string is that accepted it's
not because we're looking for a plus 1
plus so this should also be false and it
is but how about the smallest string we
do accept a 1 that 1 is accepted great
so we can check any finite state machine
to see if it accepts a string you may
have noticed as we were going through it
that edges and accepting never change I
define them once at the beginning of the
file so our finite state machine
simulator is really just a recursive in
the input and the current state and that
matches our intuition because those are
the two fingers I was using to work it
out on paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
