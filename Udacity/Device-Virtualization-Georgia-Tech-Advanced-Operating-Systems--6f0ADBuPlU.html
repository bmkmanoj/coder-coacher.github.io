operating system thinks that it owns all
the devices already and the way devices
are virtualized is the familiar trap and
emulate technique that is for the
devices that the operating system thinks
it owns when it tries to make any access
to those devices it's going to result in
a trap into the hypervisor and the
hypervisor will emulate the
functionality that the operating system
intends for that particular device in
this sense there is not much scope for
innovation in the way devices are
virtualized in a fully virtualized
environment there are lots of details of
course that the hypervisor has to worry
about once the guest traps into the
hypervisor
to ensure the legality of the i/o
operation and also whether the guest is
allowed to make those i/o operations and
so on but nothing fundamental
conceptually is there in terms of device
virtualization in a fully virtualized
environment better virtualized setting
is much more interesting the i/o devices
seen by the guest operating system are
exactly the ones that are available to
the hypervisor that is the set of
hardware devices that are available in
the platform are exactly the ones that
the para virtualized guest operating
system is going to be able to manipulate
this gives an opportunity for innovating
the interaction between the guest
operating system and the hypervisor in
particular ways in which we can make
device virtualization more efficient
when we have this para virtualized
environment
so for one thing it is possible for the
hypervisor to come up with clean and
simple device abstractions that can be
used by the para virtualized operating
system further through api's it becomes
possible for the hypervisor to expose
shared buffers to the guest operating
system so that efficiently data can be
passed between the guest operating
system and the hypervisor
and to the devices without incurring the
overhead of copying multiple times data
from one address space into another and
similarly there can be innovations in
the way event delivery happens between
the hypervisor and the guest operating
system so in order to do device
virtualization we have to worry about
two things one is how to transfer
control back and forth between the
hypervisor and the guests because device
is being Hardware entities they need
manipulation by the hypervisor in a
privileged state and there is data
transfer that needs to be done because
the hypervisor is in a different
protection domain compared to the guest
operating system so these are two things
that one has to worry about in device
virtualization and we will see how both
control transfer and data transfer are
accomplished in both the fully
virtualized and the para virtualized
settings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
