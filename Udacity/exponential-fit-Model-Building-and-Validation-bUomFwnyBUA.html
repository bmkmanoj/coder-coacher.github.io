data to an exponential distribution
we'll adjust our analysis graph as such
now as you recall from your introduction
to statistics class the form of an
exponential distribution is 1 over beta
times e to the power of minus X over
beta
thus fitting an exponential curve to the
earlier histogram means finding the
parameter beta forming the PDF from
which the observed data is most likely
to have been produced now this gets into
something called a maximum likelihood
estimation this is something that
another Udacity class it goes into a lot
of detail about we've put a link to that
lecture in the instructors notes but
very briefly the maximum likelihood
estimation strategy takes the following
approach let's suppose that I've got a
collection of data points data point D 1
D 2 through DN the maximum likelihood
estimation approach asks the question
what's the probability that I saw each
of these observed data points all at the
same time I don't know the specific
values of these probabilities but I do
know the form of them because I know
that they conform to the exponential
distribution the only thing I don't know
is beta and so I can write this
expression as a function of beta when I
maximize this I can then find the value
of beta that gives me that maximum
that's maximum likelihood estimation in
a nutshell now what does this get us if
it is the case that an exponential
process is a good model for describing
tweeting behavior then we can use it to
predict at the next tweet time so this
comes actually from a simple expectation
calculation let's suppose that we
already know the parameter beta let's
define that X is a random variable time
until next tweet
aka intertweet time now the PDF for X at
time T is just the exponential evaluated
at T the expected value of the
distribution is just this integral here
which should look very familiar which is
equal to the parameter beta so let's
think about what this means for a second
if we have a fitted exponential
distribution meaning we know what the
parameter beta is then it turns out we
can use
the parameter beta as a prediction of
the number of seconds to wait until the
next tweet now let's go ahead and find
the beta parameter using ipython
notebook let's go ahead and find the
beta parameter using ipython notebook so
here we have again the same histogram
describing intertweet x that we saw
earlier so let's first think about what
we're trying to fit we want to find the
beta parameter which produces a curve
which most looks like this in order to
perform the exponential fit we're going
to use a function from the SyFy package
called curve fit let's just go ahead and
import that so curve fit does the
following let's suppose that we got some
values which are trying to reproduce and
we've got a callable function here
called fit func which you can pass an
independent variable t and a parameter
any number of parameters but in this
case we've just got one the beta
parameter and as you can see all that
does is just evaluate an exponential at
the appropriate value you can see here
that the number B is defined as the
inverse of what it would typically be
defined at in an exponential
distribution so instead of 1 over beta
it just appears as B so you can anywhere
you see B you can think of that as 1
divided by beta so again fit func is
just a callable function which takes the
input independent variable time T and
the beta parameter represented here as
its inverse just with a letter B and
then evaluates the exponential function
at the appropriate time so if you hand
curve fit that callable function and the
values which are trying to reproduce
here captured in the variable count then
curve it finds the value of beta to put
in to fit func that best matches the
count values it does this using mean
squared error loss let's go ahead and
evaluate that you can see here that Cerf
that actually returns two parameters fit
params and fit curve the first one fit
params is just the beta parameter that
we're interested in and you can see that
the actual beta parameter is 1 over the
parameter that we've specified so 1451
and
seconds but Cerf that also returns a
covariance matrix the second thing that
Cerf it returns there's a covariance
matrix there's one entry in the
covariance matrix for each pair of
parameters that we're trying to fit for
so in our case we have only a single
parameter D that we're trying to fit for
and so the covariance matrix has only a
single entry although in general there
is more so what does the matrix mean
here in this case well what kerf it
actually did is it try to find the best
value of B over many bootstrap samples
this number here which amounts to the
variance of that number describes how
much B changed over those bootstrap
samples so the higher this covariance
value here means the more that B changed
over the bootstrap samples that means we
should be less certain of what the
parameters value is as you can see here
the covariance value is quite low 1.04
times 10 to the negative ninth that
translates to high confidence so we've
got our beta value 1450 one and a half
seconds let's take a look at how well
this fit does you can see here in blue
as the original intertweet times the
exponential fit that we just did as
displayed in yellow so we got our beta
value of 1450 one and a half seconds
recall from earlier that if we're going
to use an exponential fit as our model
then we use the beta parameter at the
number of seconds to guess until the
next time that this person tweets and so
the model that we would use in this case
is that we're going to guess 1450 one
and a half seconds until this person
tweets next let's take a look at a
histogram of the signed error of always
making that guess so here we're looping
through each value and time until next
and evaluating the difference between
that and our guess now let's look at a
histogram that's very interesting in the
next few videos we'll take a deeper look
into how well this guess turned out but
before we do that let's just summarize
where we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
