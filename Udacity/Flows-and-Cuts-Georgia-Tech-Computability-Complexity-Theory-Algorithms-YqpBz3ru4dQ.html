incremental approach of the
ford-fulkerson method produces a maximum
flow that's a good thing your intuition
is correct but it's important that it be
correct for the right reasons not all
incremental approaches work often in
optimization we get stuck in local
minima or a local maximum
we need to argue either that we never
make a mistake the analysis of greedy
algorithms typically have this feel or
we need to be able to argue that the
rules for incrementing allows us to undo
any mistakes that we have made along the
way the latter will be the case for
maximum flow the argument we'll make is
complex and will require us to introduce
a new notion of a minimum cut in a graph
along the way but in the end it's
rewarding and provides an example of how
to find elegance and analysis to show
that ford-fulkerson returns a maximum
flow we're going to introduce the
concept of a cut and then relate the
capacity of a cut to a flow here's a
picture of our understanding so far we
know that the network will have some
possible non-negative flow values but
it's not exactly clear how high this
range goes or where the results of
ford-fulkerson fit in one observation is
that the flow value can't exceed the
capacity of edges coming out of the
source remember that the flow is defined
to be the sum of the flows over these
edges separating s from T in this way
constitutes a cut in the graph which as
we'll see is an upper bound on the value
of any flow it's possible that there
will be smaller cuts as well which will
shrink the range of possible flow values
for us even better however we'll see
that the flow produced by ford-fulkerson
has the same value as a cut and since
this cut serves as an upper bound on all
possible flows this flow must be a
maximum that's where this argument will
end up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
