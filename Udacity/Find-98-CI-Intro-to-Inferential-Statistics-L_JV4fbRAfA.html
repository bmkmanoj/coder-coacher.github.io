mean is one of the 98% that falls within
two point three three standard
deviations of the population mean in
this case mu sub BT and if that's the
case then mu sub BT must be in turn
within two point three three standard
deviations of this sample mean so the
sample mean minus two point three three
standard deviations which is one point
zero one will be our lower bound for
this confidence interval so this comes
out to about thirty seven point six five
and then our upper bound for the
ninety-eight percent confidence interval
will be forty plus two point three three
times one point zero one so this is
forty two point three five approximately
so basically we got this sample mean
forty and we decided that it's possible
that it's either here or here on the
distribution such that one percent of
the data is either above it or below it
before with the 95% confidence interval
we said most likely it's going to be a
little bit closer to the mean so that
two point five percent of the data is
above it and two point five percent is
below but now we're being a little more
lenient we're allowing this sample mean
to be a little bit further from the
population mean and so now we have a
slightly bigger interval but now we're
more sure that the true population mean
will be in this interval recall that
before the 95% confidence interval was
from thirty eight point zero one to
forty one point nine nine so it was a
little smaller than this good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
