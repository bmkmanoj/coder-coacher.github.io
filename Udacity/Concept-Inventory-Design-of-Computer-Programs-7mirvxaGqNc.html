things like the roll of a dice the
implementation of scores the
implementation of the players and of the
player to move the goal so these are all
things that we're going to have to
represent and then at the high level I'm
going to have a function play pig that
plays a game between two players and I
have the notion of a strategy a strategy
that a player is taking in order to play
the game now let's think about how to
implement these things and when i'm
doing the implementation I'm going to
move top down so I started sort of
middle out saying these are the kinds of
things I think I'm going to need now I
have a good enough feel for them that I
feel confident in moving top down I
don't see any difficulties and
implementing any of these pieces so if I
start at the top then I'll be able to
make choices later on without feeling
constrained if I thought there was
something down here that was difficult
to deal with I might spend more time now
at the low level trying to resolve what
the right representation is for one of
these difficult pieces and that would
inform my high-level decisions but since
I don't see any difficulty I'm going to
jump to the high level now let's play
pig well I think that's going to be a
function and let's just say that it's
input is 2 players a and B and we
haven't decided yet how we're going to
represent those and its output is let's
say it's going to be the winner of the
game maybe a is is the winner and we'll
have to make a choice of how we
represent these players now what's a
strategy well strategy people sometimes
use the word policy for that we can also
represent that as a function and it
takes as input a state and it returns an
action or a move in the game and in this
game we said that the actions are roll
and hold so we're starting to move down
let's just say now well how are we going
to represent these actions well we can
call the actions just by strings so we
could use the strings roll and hold and
that could be what the strategy returns
but then we'll also need something that
implements these actions so we'll have
to have something
that's a function that says let's say
the function roll takes a state and
returns a new state function old takes a
state and returns a new state but hmm
that doesn't seem quite right there's a
problem here of what about the die that
seems to take an effect that that roll
by itself is not a function from state
to state rather roll if we if we wanted
to specify it would be a function from a
state to a set of states and that
represents the fundamental uncertainty
that's why we need probability to deal
with it that's why we have a uncertain
or a non-deterministic domain is because
an action doesn't have a single result
rather it can have a set of possible
result and in some cases it makes sense
to go ahead and implement these actions
as functions that look like that that
returns sets of states in and I consider
that as a possibility but I ended up
with an implementation where I talk
about the different possibilities for
the dice so the dice can come up as d
one of the number is 126 and now roll
from a particular state with a
particular die roll that's going to
return a single state rather than a set
of states and I just think it's easier
to deal this way although in other
applications you might want to deal that
way now the rest seems to be pretty easy
the dye can be represented as an integer
scores can be represented as integers
likewise the goal the player to move we
can represent that as an index 0 or 1
into an array of players and the players
themselves well the simplest way to do
it is just to represent the player by
their strategy the strategy is a
function and that could represent the
player we could have something more
complex but it seems like we don't need
anything more than that so players will
be strategy functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
