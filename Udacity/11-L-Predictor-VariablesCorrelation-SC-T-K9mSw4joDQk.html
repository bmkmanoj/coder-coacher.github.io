variables will not cause much issue
during the building of a classification
model but will cause issues during the
prediction time let us go through the
list of potential predictor variables
and use logic and correlation to remove
duplicate or inner correlated variables
if we look at the top two most
associated variables to turn there are
total day in minutes and total day and
charges if we logically think about it I
would assume that the amount a person is
charged on their phone bill for daytime
calls would be directly related to how
many minutes they talk during the day on
the left hand side we have a correlation
matrix that visually represents the
Pearson correlation values between the
different variables if we look at this
we can see the total date charge and the
total day minutes has a very bright red
block meaning those variables are highly
positively correlated the values
associated with it are also one meaning
their perfect positive correlation
further in the scatter plot on the right
hand side so you can see as the total
day minutes increases the total day
charges moves exactly in parallel with
it i would say that not only are these
variables inter correlated but there are
duplicate variables with this being said
we should remove one of the variables
since they are redundant and having
these duplicate fields will cause errors
during the prediction time of the
analysis looking at the list of
potential predictor variables again
since the total Dame it its field has a
slightly greater association to churn
then the total date charged field I will
keep that build and remove the total day
charge field let us now look at the full
heat plot of all the variables against
each other by looking at the full graph
I'm scoping out three things one we're
very red blocks these very red blocks
represent highly positively correlated
variables the second thing I'm looking
for are very blue boxes which represent
highly negative correlation between
variables
the third thing I'm looking for is
little to no color what this represents
is little correlation between our
variables now will observe variables
that have very little correlation since
these are the variables that can be used
as predictors together since they have
very little inner correlation if we look
at the total international minutes
versus the total evening minutes we can
see that the correlation between the two
variables is very low at point zero two
in the scatterplot we see no patterns
and total randomness meeting that the
movement in one field does not affect
the other this is exactly what we are
wanting in our predictor variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
