come up with Knuth calls it algorithm P
other people have discovered it before
him so it's been discovered over and
over again and the idea is you just go
through the deck and make one swap for
each of the index I and what we swap it
with gives an equal chance for any of
the items that haven't been seen yet to
occur in position I so again we've got
our deck and we're going through one at
a time looking at each position and when
we get to a general position I we're
going to swap I with the range from I
through to the end so we're going to
pick out for this element I any one of
these elements and then swap them say we
pick this one and we would swap those
two and then we'd move on to the next
position of Olli so the very first
element we pick any element in the array
swap it into the first position then we
look at the second element and pick any
element from the second on swap it into
that position and so on and so we can
see that every element in the array has
an equal opportunity to appear at each
position so the qualities of these
algorithms of this algorithm that I like
is that it's so simple and clear it just
says in one statement it makes it
obvious that each location I can have
any of the elements of the deck with
equal probability
now there's one part of it I guess which
is not the most clear which is are we
exactly right here here we've got n and
here we've got n minus one and that
should bother you a little bit do we
have this right in general ranges are
tricky in Python because ranges go from
you know if we say random range from I
to n it's not going all the way up to n
it's only going to n minus one and same
thing here if we say from range to n
minus one that's actually the biggest
number there is n minus two but there's
n minus one of them because we include
zero so ranges are always a little bit
tricky we can have these off by one
errors we want to make sure that we got
this right and so let's have another
quiz
and the quiz is for that statement for I
in range and minus one what would happen
if we replaced the N minus one with an N
and the options are would that give us
an index error that we've gone too far
into the deck and we can have the wrong
index would it give us a value error
from random range would it tell us
you've got the wrong number in there
would it give us no error but the
results would be unfair in that one
permutation of the deck might be more
common or more probable than another or
would it give us no error and still be
fair but maybe just a little bit slower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
