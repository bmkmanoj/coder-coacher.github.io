substitutions in practice alright here
we are back in our that simple text file
but play HTML file I was playing with
before and we're going to we're going to
use this because it's a little bit
quicker to to demonstrate what I'd like
to talk about so I'm going to enter some
text so I've typed in some text I save
this and I load this in my browser okay
so here we are I've loaded this text in
my browser and if you remember if I just
type in plain text in an HTML file it
just shows up as plain text in the
browser okay now I'm going to surround
this tag with angle brackets and let's
see how this renders in our browser when
I reload my browser that word HTML
disappeared that's because when I put an
go brackets around it it turned into a
tag and tags don't render in HTML they
turn into tags so if we use the escaping
we just learned and I replace this less
than symbol with our escape which is
ampersand LT semicolon and I replace the
greater than with ampersand greater than
semicolon and I reload this in my
browser what we see is the actual text
that we were that we wanted to
demonstrate which is the actual angle
brackets so let's try another quick
example of this bar to change the string
HTML to the word B or to the letter B
and save this and reload in my browser
we we now have the B tag if I were to go
back to my editor and change these less
than and greater than back into the
actual less-than and greater-than
and reload this in my browser a text
turns the bold so if we don't want our
HTML to the behave as HTML we need to
escape it and if we want it to behave as
HTML we don't escape it all right try
some escaping on your own so what is the
correct way to include the text and
first and equals ampersand am p
semicolon in rendered HTML so it should
look like this once it's rendered in the
browser what do we need to include in
the HTML to get that output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
