advocate at Google and I'm Cameron
Pittman I make front-end courses here at
Udacity Cameron and I want to help you
build better forms because almost any
meaningful experience on the web's come
with boxes they need to be filled it
might be a registration form a shopping
cart or a sign inform all of these need
simple forms and why well it's because
the simpler the form is the more
conversions you're going to see right
and in fact according to Chrome usage
data you can make forms thirty percent
faster by just making them ready to
autofill we will dive into it in the
second lesson for now just remember that
with faster phones comes happier users
and more conversion and that's why we're
here this course is all about best
practices for designing and developing
forms we want you to build forms that
work great for all your users no matter
they platform mobile or desktop however
mobile platforms are a bit more of a
challenge due to the smaller screen size
so we are going to focus on them more in
this course yes and for this course you
know and I expect that you're a web
developer who understands the
fundamentals of HTML CSS and JavaScript
we expect that you've been building
sites with forms and you're always
trying to stay up to date with best
practices in the first two lessons
you'll be learning about inputs that
make up firms all the little button and
toggles that clatter user scripts and in
the third lesson you'll take on forms as
a whole and examine what you can do to
convert more users this is especially
important for ecommerce sites but it
certainly applies to any kind of long
form in the last lesson you'll make
forms reactive and touchable for mobile
users so that sounds like a lot of fun
