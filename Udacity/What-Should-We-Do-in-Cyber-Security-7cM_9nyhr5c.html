that we need to do something about
cybersecurity so how can that be done
making them go away is not an easy thing
obviously one thing we can do is we can
make sure that crime doesn't pay we're
actually going to talk about cyber laws
but making threats go away is a nice
idea but it hasn't really been all that
effective you can reduce vulnerabilities
but we're never going to have zero
vulnerabilities complex systems
unfortunately always going to be
error-prone and some of those errors are
going to be wallenberg is that can be
exploited the three things that you
always talk about when you talk about
securing or protecting access to
information is the data sensitive in the
sense that it cannot be disclosed to
unauthorized parties well that is really
the means that the data has what we call
a confidentiality requirement we want to
stop or prevent disclosure it could be
seen but can only be seen by those who
are authorized to see it another
requirement is what's called integrity
that really means that no one should be
able to corrupt it so maybe not
sensitive in the sense that no one
should be able to see it if they're not
authorized but it could have integrity
requirement only authorized people
should be able to write it or modify it
no one else should be able to change it
and that is an integrity requirement the
third requirement we have for data is
what's called availability the data is
critical in the sense you know what we
use it for is critical so if the data
goes away if you're not able to do
something that's really important to us
we can't access our online banking
services because the server has been
compromised is down or is it an
all-service attack or something like
that so these are called
the CI a confidentiality integrity and
availability requirements for sensitive
data so here we're only talking about
data which is sort of the cyber side we
should say that cyber attacks could also
have physical consequences so by
successfully attacking the computers we
will be able to cause harm to the
physical system most well-known case of
this is Stuxnet malware that infiltrated
Iranian nuclear plant Network and
destroyed centrifuges and so on so
that's an example where it's not is this
information disclosed it or corruption
but there is actually a physical
manifestation office I were attacked
when we say what should we do well we
need to protect data and we need to
protect systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
