showcase you yet another example of
similar coded photography except this
time we're going to talk about the
concept of a flutter shutter camera the
flutter shutter camera basically now
attempts to do the same thing the coated
camera did except that this time around
rather than changed the aperture it
mounts to change something about the
shutter encoded aperture we added
obstructions to the aperture in Florida
shutter let's control when the shutter
opens and closes so you know again have
the whole thing and just figure out how
to open and close it in a specific
manner just to kind of look at this
let's look at this series of examples a
standard camera or traditional camera
when it takes picture when the shutter
is open you get one frame right and
these are Archaean ideas come from this
raw score at all 2006 paper that's also
referenced at the end and also will
provide you the links way to look at in
detail and to encourage you to look at
these papers to kind of get a good sense
of the exact technical details I'm just
summarizing them and giving you the big
overview of these concepts here so of
course when I open the shutter like this
and if the car is moving what I would
basically get is a car is moved and if I
actually have the shutter you'd actually
get some sort of a blur a motion blur in
this instance right let's look at it
again when I open the shutter car is
moving and of course depending on how
long the shutter is open I will get a
blurry image like this well let's
actually do something interesting let's
actually change how the shutter opens
and also control it a minute closes so
now basically what we will do is we'll
open and close the shutter and this is
basically showing you this now if I know
exactly how this opens and closes this
is interesting now I do get a motion
blur image but if you notice this one
has a very specific sharp lines let's
look at them next to each other this was
when the shutter was open the whole time
and this is when we kind of flutter
shutter did that is opened and closed it
at different rates here everything is
blurred in this one you do see some blur
but actually there is a little bit for
better signature so you for example see
these lines a different you know there's
no of course detail here whatsoever but
here you actually see different
characteristic lines on this image this
actually is much more useful than
this and if I actually know this code
then actually snow a lot more about this
image too and that's the basic idea if I
know the code on how and when I open
this I should be able to kind of use
this information to model the output
that I'm getting after all of this is
accumulated or integrated here I know
all of it but since I have no control
over how the aspects of what happened in
the middle everything is blurred so
roster it all actually designed this
camera by actually just taking an
existing camera and putting some sort of
an additional controller but basically
change the control after how the shutter
opens and closes with a digital process
here so they actually could actually
figure out the exact code on how did the
shutter would open so they created this
new camera to do this and they did a lot
of other experiments with it again I
recommend you to look at the paper for
more details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
