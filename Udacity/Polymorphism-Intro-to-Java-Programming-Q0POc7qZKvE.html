of an interface and I hope you've become
more familiar with how they work they're
really pretty natural but when you think
about it there is something mysterious
going on in our suburban scene we had an
ArrayList of drawables houses cars dogs
and so on we got one of them stored it
in a variable of type drawable of course
then called the draw method on it that
has to work D belongs to the drawable
type and drawable has a draw method
what's D it's a variable so it holds a
reference to an object an object off
what class you might think it's an
object of class drawable but wait a
minute there is no class drawable
drawable is an interface so that can't
be it and in fact there's no way of
knowing to which class this object
belongs there's only one thing that we
know about it this object belongs to
some class that has a draw method and in
fact as you loop over the various
elements in the ArrayList
this line of code may call different
methods the draw method of the house
class the door class or of some other
class so for unimaginative the drawable
interface this variation is called
polymorphism which is just a fancy word
for saying different shapes in our scene
that's a very appropriate name because
the draw method can draw entirely
different shapes depending on what the
implementing class does but the term
polymorphism is used generally in Java
to indicate any situation where you have
a method call and the actual method
called depends on the type of the object
now why is polymorphism important it
lets us build expandable systems where
we can add new types without having to
change the essential logic of the
program I'd like you to try this out and
add a new type to our suburban scene
namely a ball class simply the kind of
ball that you might find lying on a
street and when you do that note how
little of the program you have to change
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
