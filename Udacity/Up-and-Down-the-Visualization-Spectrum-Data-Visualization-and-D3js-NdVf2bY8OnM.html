a variety of technologies and tools that
enable designers artists developers and
data scientists to express their views
and communicate their insights with the
world at large and while we will try to
expose you to what we think are the most
relevant tools to help you create data
visualizations there are far too many
technologies out there to cover them all
however you may encounter them or at
least people who use them so is a good
idea to have some sense of what is there
at the bottom of the spectrum are low
level graphics formats and
specifications these are some of the
most efficient performant and flexible
of your options when choosing to create
a visualization but our very low level
and have significant overhead not only
to learn but to develop in think of
these as the assembly language of
visualizations while these technologies
are very flexible in what you can do
they force you to specify what you want
done in terms of pixels and lines or
rather place a point at X Y and create a
path to point W Z this is much like if
you're instructing a painter or robot
how to draw as you go up the spectrum
the higher level languages and libraries
becomes much easier and faster to
develop your graphics though the tool
you may use maybe slightly less flexible
than raw html5 canvas WebGL or SVG a hop
skip and a jump up we have our beloved
d3.js we will get more into the
specifics of d3 in just a second but it
is a data visualization library built
atop open web standards it is
implemented in JavaScript and allows for
seamless binding of data to HTML and SVG
elements are actually anything on a web
page really since you can style HTML and
SVG with CSS CSS works very naturally
with the whole stack of technologies
that d3.js is built atop d3
right to what most people may think is
actually pretty low of an abstraction if
we were continuing our analogy of
programming languages and what they're
built atop I would say that d3 in the
spectrum of visualization technologies
is actually at a similar level to where
C or C++ is in the whole spectrum of
programming languages and just like
people use C and C++ to build operating
systems programs and compilers for other
languages d3 really shines when you use
it to build higher level abstractions
and libraries on top of it and this
brings us to the suite of d3.js
libraries this layer represents the
plethora of high-level libraries built
atop the building blocks of d3 all there
are far too many libraries to list or
even fit on the screen they're built
atop d3 three of the most common or ones
that we had mention this class are
rikshaw dimple Jas and envy d3 people
often like to think of d3.js as data
visualization library Legos you can very
easily compose d3.js components to build
higher level abstractions and libraries
on top of it while that might seem very
daunting to navigate the space of every
library built on top of d3 they usually
fall into one of two categories they are
either high level charting libraries
like NV d3 and dimple GIS or they are
tailored to a specific type of data like
rickshaw rickshaw was built to most
effectively and easily visualized time
series and real-time streaming data in
this same vein of visualizing a specific
type of data are also Geographic
libraries to help plot data on maps and
add interaction to maps we will use
dimple J s in this class in the later
lessons and really experience the power
of using a higher level abstraction than
straight d3 and again going back to our
spectrum of programming languages
webgl canvas and SVG are analogous to
assembly language d3 is analogous to c
and c++ I would say the higher-level
libraries built the top of d3 are
similar in abstraction level to
something like Python or Ruby Python and
Ruby are fairly high level languages
they're interpreted you don't have to
deal with memory collection and many
times they are implemented in C or C++
and just like these higher-level
languages are implemented in a lower
level language NV d3 dimple Jas and
rikshaw can be thought of as implemented
in or on top of d3.js at the very top of
this spectrum are libraries that have
graphical interfaces for creating
visualizations such as raw or char do
raw is an open source library built on
top of d3 that allows you to very easily
and quickly build predefined charts char
do is a web-based product similar to
tableau that allows you to very quickly
and easily explore your data to build
dashboards and charts hence the name
chart yo
since these libraries are so high up on
the spectrum they have very limited
flexibility and can usually only produce
a set of predefined charts the upside to
having a set number of predefined charts
is it creates those almost effortlessly
and quite seamlessly think of these as
the excel of data visualization
libraries they are incredibly useful for
about 90 or 95% of the use cases you
most likely will encounter and they make
those 95% of cases quite effortless if
their charts happen to match what you're
looking for but if you stray from this
path of predefined charts it may be
cumbersome if not impossible to
customize them if none of my silly
analogy to computer programming
languages made any sense
do not worry you will not need to know
any of this for the class hopefully
however
helped some folks get a better sense of
where each of these technology stands on
the spectrum of abstraction and
visualization I sometime like to think
of these technologies existing within a
pyramid of abstraction think of the
width of the level of the pyramid
representing how flexible each of the
technologies at that level are and the
height of the pyramid is how easy makes
it to create visualizations and how much
developer productivity they enable at
the bottom of the pyramid are
technologies that have quite a lot of
flexibility and offer a lot of gains in
performance and efficiency but may be
very difficult to use and slow to
develop in at the other end of the
spectrum and at the top of the pyramid
you have technologies like raw and char
do which are very easy to use allow you
to develop visualizations very quickly
and iterate on those visualizations but
may be much less flexible than something
like WebGL
or d3 one thing you always have to
consider as a developer especially if
you're working on a data science project
where the entire scope of the project is
much larger than just the visualization
portion is the trade-off between
developer productivity and efficiency of
your solution due to recent trends and
the performance improvements in the
browser and the vault technologies
involved and also in the abstractions
created by higher-level libraries
developers are quite fortunate and get
something of the best of both worlds
between being very productive and having
quite flexible and efficient libraries
because of this you can have your cake
and eat it too
or rather code in a high-level library
and still get decent performance and
flexibility and while each of the many
data visualization libraries out there
have their strengths and weaknesses in
this class we will focus on the
particular JavaScript library d3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
