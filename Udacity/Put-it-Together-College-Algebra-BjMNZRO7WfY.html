trying to simplify this expression is to
look at each of the terms and figure out
if I can squish it down at all so first
we have 15 x squared there's nothing
that I can do to make that more simple
on its own so I'm just going to rewrite
it then 3 X to the 7th same thing then I
come to negative 7x times 2x now there
are definitely some factors here that I
can combine if i rearrange the order of
these things i can put negative seven
and two next to each other and then the
exes at the end negative 7 times 2 is
negative 14 so I'll have a coefficient
of negative 14 and then we have times X
times X we know that x times x is just x
to the second power so i can write that
as well moving on we have negative 4
times 2x we can again combine the
constant factors so we have minus 8x
negative 5 times 4 5 times 4 is 20 so we
have negative 20 plus x times 3 we can
just rearrange the order of those two
and then we have 3 times X which is just
3 X so plus 3x great now each of the
terms in and of itself is a simplified
as it can get the next step is to figure
out which terms are like terms I'm also
going to already start writing like
terms next to each other in a modified
version of the equation wave 2x squared
terms only one x to the seventh term 2x
to the first terms and one constant term
now I just need to combine the terms
that I know are like terms remember that
we add the coefficients of like terms
together and then multiply by the
variable 15-14 is 1 so we have 1 times x
squared or just x squared three X to the
seventh is on its own it's not combined
with anything else negative 8 plus 3 is
negative 5 times the variable X and then
we have our constant term so this right
here is our final answer our long not
very pretty expression has been squished
down to be something much more
manageable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
