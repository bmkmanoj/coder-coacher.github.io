called the instance variables in the
case of class movie there were several
of them tidal storyline poster image URL
and trailer YouTube URL now further
recall that these variables are
associated with every instance that we
create for example both Toy Story and
avatar have their own copies of these
variables so I could print out Toy Story
storyline and I could also print out
Avatar storyline sometimes however we
need variables that we want all of our
instances to share
so consider the variable valid ratings
for a movie this is an array or a list
of all possible ratings a movie could
have now it would not quite make sense
to say hey here are toy stories valid
ratings and here are avatars valid
ratings they would essentially be the
same for all instances
thus this variable is really associated
with a class movie and is therefore
called a class variable let's see it in
action so here is the code for our class
movie and behind this Python file is the
other Python file we created where we
made a bunch of movie instances so I'm
going to begin by making changes to my
class movie now here I will define a
variable called valid ratings now notice
that this variable valid ratings is
defined at the level of the class and is
outside the init function in order to
start using this variable we will begin
by saving this file first so next I'm
going to go to my other Python file by
the way this is the file where we are
defining a bunch of movie instances and
here I will scroll down all the way to
the bottom and comment out any sort of
print or output statements now I'm doing
this so I can focus primarily on valid
ratings now here I will try to print out
the value of the variable valid ratings
by saying print and the name of my class
which is media dot movie followed by the
name of the variable which is valid
ratings there let me save and run this
program and boom there it is a list of
all of my valid ratings
notice how we use the class name movie'
to access this variable this means that
all instances of this class movie Toy
Story Avatar and others they can share
this list they can share this list to
see if their individual reading is a
valid one or not okay so the one last
thing I want to do is go back to my
class movie now notice that the value of
this variable valid strings is probably
a constant by that I mean that the value
of this variable is probably not going
to change every now and then when we
define a constant like this the Google
style guide for Python recommends that
we use all caps or an uppercase to
define a variable like that I'm going to
go ahead and save this file and then go
back to my other Python file and change
the variable name there as well let me
save and run this program to see if it
still works and there it is I get the
correct output one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
