be a bit of a pain to work with at first
so let me show you a few tips and tricks
generally I work in an incognito window
that way I can be sure that each time I
close and reopen the window the service
worker and anything stored in the cache
has been blown away and I'm starting
fresh chrome ford / serviceworker hyphen
internals is a super helpful tool it'll
show you all of the installed service
workers their state allow you to update
them or get rid of them the open
devtools window and pause JavaScript
execution on service workers start up
for debugging is helpful if you need to
debug the install event or code that's
run when the serviceworker first wakes
up but be careful with it if you have
multiple sites with service workers
installed it'll open for every site
which can be a pain when you're
debugging one site when you open a page
that has a serviceworker the browser
spins up that service worker then if you
open another page that falls within the
scope of that service worker the browser
doesn't spin up another service worker
it uses the same one that means if you
have multiple tabs or windows open
there's only one service worker but what
happens when you update the service
worker the new service worker sits idle
waiting until all of the windows that
use the previous service worker have
closed check out the skip waiting and
clients claim for a way to avoid this in
addition to the service workers internal
page you can also use the resources tab
in the chrome devtools to see what's
going on with your service worker it
also gives you access to the caf so you
can verify everything was cached
properly finally if you didn't use an
incognito window and you want to get rid
of everything you can use Chrome
settings cookies and remove everything
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
