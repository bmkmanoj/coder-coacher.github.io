certain things to assume that an
activator bound enhancer increases
transcription and a repressor bound
silence or decreases transcriptional
activity so which of the following would
show the least amount of transcription
well a bound enhancer and unbound sounds
sure this is going to be the most right
this is going to be a lot so it's not
that answer if we have both the bound
enhancer working in the silence you're
bound they're both working against each
other so that's probably not it because
we still have something promoting
transcription but here we have just the
bound silencer and no enhancer bound so
this is going to be the least amount of
transcription if both are unbound you'll
get some basal transcription but we're
not actively repressing this as we are
in this scenario it's not as decreased
transcription its levels aren't quite as
low as what we would find in this
scenario here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
