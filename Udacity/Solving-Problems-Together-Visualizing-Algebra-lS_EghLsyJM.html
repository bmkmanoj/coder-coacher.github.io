work alone what if you guys solve the
problems together the amount of work you
do in one hour plus the amount of work
Anthony does in one hour would equal the
total fraction of work you both can do
in one hour in other words we knew that
you can complete half of the job in one
hour and Anthony could complete a third
of the job in one hour so if we add
these two fractions together this would
be the total sum or the fraction of the
job that you both could do in one hours
time notice that the denominator here
represents the time that it took for you
to do the entire job and for Anthony the
three represents the amount of time it
took for him to do the entire job this
means that X represents the total number
of hours for you and Anthony to do that
job together so working together how
long would it actually take you and
Anthony to complete the assignment
together write the number of hours it
would take them to complete the work
together here and then convert that
answer to the number of minutes it would
take them to complete the work here keep
in mind I don't want you to write your
answer as hours and minutes I want you
to write the fraction are the number of
hours here and then convert that
fraction to the total number of minutes
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
