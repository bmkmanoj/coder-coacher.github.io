bipolar disorder is depression a person
needs to be clinically depressed for the
most part but they also need to
experience mania now to help you
remember the symptoms of the mania stage
there's a mnemonic device that you can
use and that's dig fast first we have
distractibility an indiscretion
grandiosity a flight of ideas activity
increased sleep which during the mania
stage you have a decreased need for and
talkativeness there are different types
of bipolar disorder but we're going to
discuss three here let's start with
bipolar one and bipolar two bipolar one
is more severe that's because the person
meets the clinical criteria for major
depression and from mania for at least
seven consecutive days on the other hand
with bipolar two the individual meets of
criteria for major depression and the
criteria for hypomania hypomania
episodes are similar to the symptoms of
mania so think about that dig fast
pneumonic device that we just spoke
about
however these episodes are much shorter
in duration they last for at least four
consecutive days so we see the
difference between hypomania and mania
as the distinction between someone
having a more severe form of bipolar or
less severe form nevertheless whenever
it's bipolar 1 or 2 it's clear to see
how it can be a difficult disorder to
live with in fact it can be exhausting
however there are treatments available
which we'll discuss in our next lesson
the 3rd disorder we'll discuss is called
cyclothymia this is a milder but
longer-lasting form of bipolar disorder
this has both manic and depressive
episodes but it's less severe than
bipolar two disorder because the manic
and the depressive symptoms never reach
the criteria of major depression or even
hypomania</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
