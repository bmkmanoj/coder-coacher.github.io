this part of the quiz do with dispatch
and instruction in cycle five no we do
not all of these instructions are
waiting for something to be broadcast so
until we actually broadcast some results
and these instructions can capture the
values they will not be able to dispatch
both of them are waiting for something
so this should be empty do we write any
results yes the instruction in Rob trie
is an ad it began executing in cycle
four it takes one cycle to execute so in
cycle five it will write its result so
the correct answer here is Rob tree this
is which instruction writes its result
in cycle five as a result of this right
result in cycle five we mark this Rob
tree entry as done the value of three is
broadcast with the tag of Rob tree it
gets captured here because this
instruction is waiting for Rob tree so
in fact because we can dispatch this
instruction in the same cycle in cycle
five this subtract does dispatch so the
instruction in Rob five will dispatch
and it will begin executing in cycle six
so this is somewhat of a trick question
because you needed to first figure out
that this right result happens and as a
result of this we enable the dispatch of
this instruction so it's kind of
interesting in that in this cycle this
instruction has been issued capture the
result and dispatched</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
