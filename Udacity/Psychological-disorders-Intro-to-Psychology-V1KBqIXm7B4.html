we're gonna discuss two topics that many
people think are the sum of psychology
that's mental disorders and their
treatments however as we've talked about
in the last 14 lessons that this is an
all psychology has to offer and as we've
said before many psychologists have
different opinions on different things
and mental disorders in their treatments
are two of those things
in fact many government agencies
question the way we diagnose mental
disorders but we'll get into that in a
little bit for now let's go to Susan for
an important note on the upcoming
lessons as we discuss with many of the
topics such as consciousness arousal and
stress we can use the idea of a
continuum to look at what is considered
normal and what is considered not normal
and that's what makes diagnosing mental
disorders so problematic and challenging
and that we have to determine what is
too far on the continuum to be
considered normal
now here are we say normal we're talking
about that in a statistical sense and
not necessarily a value judgment now
psychologists who study mental disorders
do so to understand treat and prevent
human misery when behavior falls outside
of the normal range on that continuum
many people find this area of psychology
very interesting and although the way
society has treated people with mental
illness has evolved greatly there are
still cross-cultural differences in the
way people view and treat individuals
with mental illness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
