approach to OA is to write out use cases
recall that a use case is a simple story
illustrating a single execution or
pointing out an important obstacle that
the user might confront for the case of
the coffeemaker can you come up with a
few use cases what's brewin so if they
did press the blue button okay that was
I guess the first use case there's a
couple things that could happen
everything could be right yes all of our
preconditions are there or there could
be no water for the brewing process to
start or this the filter is not in place
or no coffee grounds those are some
problems that could happen so on that
one notice that so far we haven't we
don't have any sensor for the grounds
okay so if there's no grounds in there
you're going to get very very weak
coffee mm-hmm okay and if there's no
filter what you're going to get your
coffee pretty quickly right it seems it
I guess I have a question in regards to
that use case is the problem of them not
having coffee grounds something that the
system should even worry about because
it seems like that would be hard to tell
like the filter being in place I can
imagine and being something a sensor
could tell but how much coffee is in
your your filter could be maybe
something that's not supported I don't
know so this is an issue with a
designing software and hardware at the
same time so you could imagine for
example in the mark five having a sensor
for the receptor receptacle actually
clicking in okay when you push it in
there trying to figure out how many
grounds are in there or how you know how
deep the grounds are something our
hardware people haven't gotten that one
yet okay so we're not going to be able
to sense that very well it sounds a
little bit like trying to count in jelly
beans in a jar or something but anyways
the other use cases I have involved
removing or placing the pot because we
have an indicator for that so I
something that I stood out and then also
when you fill the water receptacle we
have an indicator whether the water was
there not so that seemed to be a
interaction it had something the user
could see so let's consider four of
those the user press pushes the brew
button and that's our primary
one and then some contingent ones the
containment vessel is not ready the
coffee is all gone or we could have that
the the brewing is actually complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
