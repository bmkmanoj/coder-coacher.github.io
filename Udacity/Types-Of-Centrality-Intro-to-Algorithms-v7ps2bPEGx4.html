ordering process takes place in social
network analysis is in measuring the
centrality of different nodes now we
talked a little bit about centrality in
a previous unit but let me let me talk a
little bit about some different types of
centrality that you might find useful so
one that we're going to return to and
we've already kind of touched on is this
node of closeness centrality the idea
that a given node is central if it has
short path to other nodes in the network
between the centrality has to do with
the idea that a node is central if most
of the shortest path between arbitrarily
chosen pairs of nodes in the network end
up having to pass through the node in
question so it's it's between most of
the other nodes it's kind of stuck
between them node centrality is actually
a much simpler concept it just says that
a node is central if it has lots of
edges if it's if it's very well
connected and this is well connected in
a very local sense just in terms of the
the degree of the node or the number of
neighbors said it has so we're going to
let's look at this one first and then
we're going to combine what we learn
with other kinds of path based metrics
