an image of a microphone but when I
click on it nothing happens so let's
change that notice that we are currently
in the standard editor how do I know
that you ask well because this button
which is labeled standard editor is
selected the button right next to it is
called the assistant editor if I click
on it
Xcode continues to show me the
storyboard but in addition to that it
shows me another file which is logically
related to the storyboard this file is
called viewcontroller.swift let me slide
out the navigator so we can see this a
little bit better there now the way
these two are related is that when we
click on the record button some code
will get executed and that code will go
right here in the viewcontroller.swift
by the way this file
viewcontroller.swift was created by
Xcode when we made our project now I can
almost hear some of you say how are
these two files related here's how let
me select this phone frame in the
storyboard such that there is a blue
outline around it and now if I slide out
the utility area and then click on this
little icon right here which is labeled
identity inspector I can see that this
frame is connected to a class called
view controller by the way all of this
work was done by Xcode when we actually
made our app okay let me slide out the
utility area for a bit
all right let's scan the code inside
this file viewcontroller.swift now it's
okay if you do not understand everything
in this file for now I just want to
highlight that the name of this file is
the exact same as the name of the class
inside the file and this class has two
functions viewdidload and did receive
memory warning now these are functions
that allow us to manage or control
certain events with the app for instance
if we wanted our app to do something
special in case our app received a
memory warning that code would go right
in here
all right now I'm going to write code
that will execute when we hit this
button I will press and hold control
on my keyboard click on the button and
then drag towards my code and once I'm
there I'll let go you will be presented
with a pop-up that will try and make a
connection between the storyboard and
this code and because we are trying to
do something when we click on this
button the type of disconnection is
action let's call the name of this
connection a record audio the type of
the button is UI button UI stands for
user interface under event I will select
touch up inside what that means is that
this event will be triggered when my
finger is within the bounds of the
button and then I'll hit connect all
right I now have a skeleton function
which will be called when I hit the
record button let's examine this
function its name is a record audio
which seems about right
also the center of this action or the
thing that actually triggers this
function is our UI button we also see
something new something called IB action
IB stands for interface builder and this
thing tells developers that this is not
an ordinary function but is instead
linked to the storyboard or the
interface builder somehow ok so I want
to do two things when this function is
called the first is that I want to show
some text that says recording in
progress and then the other thing I want
to do is actually record the users voice
by the way when you start to add to Do's
in this way they start to show up really
clearly in this drop-down at the top
this way you can easily keep track of
the things you need to do for now I'm
going to add a print statement to this
function and see if this function is in
fact executed when I click on this
button I'm going to run this project now
when I click on the button I will see
the output of the print statement in the
debug area at the bottom of Xcode let me
do that one more time there it is
alright I'm going to go back to my Xcode
slide out the debug area from here and
the next thing I'm going to do
is show some text that reads recording
in progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
