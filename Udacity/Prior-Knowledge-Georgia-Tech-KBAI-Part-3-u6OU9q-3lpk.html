knowledge of these four concepts a brick
a glass a bowl and a briefcase let us
look at one of these concepts in detail
so the brick is stable because the
bottom is flat and a brick is heavy so
first this particular conceptual
characterization and several parts about
stability and about heaviness second
there is also something about causality
here the brick is stable because it's
bottom is flat this is an important
element of the brick and similar things
occurred in the other four concepts that
is now consider how an AI agent might be
able to represent all of this knowledge
about a brick it is a visual rendering
of this representation first the air
agent knows about a lot of facts about
the brick so brick is heavy the brick
has a bottom at the bottom is flat that
comes from the second part of the first
sentence bottom is flat and also to the
brick is stable so here are some
observable facts and this is a property
of the brick so this is part of the
structure of the break this is part of
its function in addition the air agent
knows that the brick is stable because
the bottom is flat so we need to capture
this notion of causality so this yellow
arrows hair are intended to capture this
notion of causality the AI agent knows
that the brick is stable because the
brick has a bottom and the bottom is
flat in this way it connects these
structural features do these functional
features to this causal connections to
take another example here is a
conceptual characterization of a
briefcase and here is its knowledge
representation and not go through this
in great detail but briefly a briefcase
is liftable because it has a hundred and
it is light it is useful because it
contains papers notice the notion of
causality here again once again there is
is facts about the briefcase for example
the briefcase is portable in the
briefcase as a handle their structural
observable features a delicious
functional features like briefcase is
useful in briefcase is liftable then we
have this yellow arrows denoting the
causal connections between them
similarly for the ball here is its
conceptual characterization and the
knowledge representation so the ball
contains cherry soup that's one of the
fact here the ball has concave there's
another fact here and there is a causal
relationship
here it carries liquid because it is
concave finally the fourth council to
the agent knows about a glass and the
glass enables drinking because it
carries liquid and it is liftable and it
is pretty for the glasses pretty the
glass carries liquid it is liftable and
the fact that it enables ringing is
because of these two other facts not
quickly that not all these structural
features participate in this causal
explanation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
