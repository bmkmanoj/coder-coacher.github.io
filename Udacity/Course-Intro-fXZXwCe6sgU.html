advocate at Google in my previous role
as studio CTO at Zynga it's my full-time
job to help my team tulip to be as
productive and happy as possible NM
James Williams of course developer here
at Udacity where make Android and web
courses in the next few lessons we're
going to teach how to use tools okay not
these tools but these tools to help you
become a better and more efficient web
developer whether you're just starting
out or have been around for a while and
want to freshen up so how we going to do
this you're going to stay here and
translate all the tooling mumbo-jumbo
into English and explain ideas and
concepts well then you have to make sure
that all the material stays in long-term
memory by quizzing our students and so
on now here's a quick disclaimer I
promise you come out here supercharged
and more productive than ever it's going
to involve a lot of fiddling with the
terminal a lot of keyboard shortcuts and
general grunt work oh god work i should
say but we'll get to that later but we
try to spice it up as much as possible
all right let's talk about what you'll
learn in this course we'll kick it off
with setting up your development
environment to achieve that perfect flow
finally let's get your coworker that you
can delegate tasks to your build process
and then we'll dive into all the things
that fellow is good at express its live
coding preventing yourself from
disasters and saving a lot of time and
effort with automatic optimizations so
let's get going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
