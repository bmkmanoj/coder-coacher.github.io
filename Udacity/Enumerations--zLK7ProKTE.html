enumerations and structs from other
languages enumerations define a set of
related values and a struct is a
convenient way to bundle properties
together in Swift enumerations and
structs are more powerful than in other
languages because they can have their
own methods and are able to conform to
protocols in other words in Swift it's
easy to give an enum or a struct its own
suite of functionalities let's start
with enumerations enums are usually used
for a finite set of values any number of
the primary colors would look like this
you start with the word enum followed by
the name of the group and in between
curly braces you have a list of members
preceded by the word case here's another
example this is an enum of my aunties
notice that you don't have to write the
word case for every member you can use
this shorthand in which members are
separated by commas you might be used to
enums having integer values like they do
in C in Swift enum members can take on a
value of any primitive type for example
i have this enum of the American League
West Division let's say I wanted each
member to hold the value of their home
city as a string I just indicate string
appear next to the name of the enum and
then i can define those values in the
enum definition like so you can access
those string values like this with the
built-in property raw value enums and
switch statements work really well
together here's a statement that
switches on the value of the variable
destination destination is an enum of
type California Park which you can see
has four members this statement prints
out different warnings based on which
enum member matches the value of
destination notice that if I leave out
one of the parks the compiler gives me a
warning this can be especially helpful
if I add a value to an enum after I've
already used it in a switch statement
the compiler helps me make sure all my
switch statements are exhaustive as you
saw up here initialization of an enum
type is really simple they're just
defined with a specific member of the
enum alternatively they can also be
designed with raw values like these City
strings we used for the American League
West or they can be defined with what
are called fela belen ishal I zehrs for
more on those options follow the link in
the instructors notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
