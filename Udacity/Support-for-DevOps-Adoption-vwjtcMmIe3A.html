coming from either the bottom up or the
top down but I think there's a
limitation so I think it really it takes
the whole village we can start from the
bottom and we can get a measure of
success you can automate infrastructure
you can start to spread some knowledge
about those practices you can start from
the top you can mandate or you can try
to create an environment in which you
are looking to avoid snowflakes in your
production environment and that kind of
messaging will go some way but at some
point you need a comment or shared goal
I think this is where the XP principle
of a shared metaphor is really important
organizationally you want everyone to
understand that the context around what
better looks like and I think that that
can't come in just from the line of
execution in the same way that it cannot
come from the top I think in lean
there's this there's this idea of going
to the place where the work happens it's
going to the gemba and I think that's a
great metaphor for how the leadership in
an organization and the line of
execution can come together to make a
develops transformation super effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
