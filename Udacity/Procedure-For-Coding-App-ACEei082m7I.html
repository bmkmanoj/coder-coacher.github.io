google services you'll generally use an
asynchronous programming model that
looks a little bit like this in the
oncreate of your activity you create a
Google API client and then in the on
start of your activity you connect that
Google API client to the relevant AP is
in this case location services in order
to use this you're going to need to
override a number of different methods
one is unconnected failed which the
services will call whenever the
connection drops and you need to handle
what to do generally just reconnecting
one is unconnected suspended which is
very similar to on connection failed and
it'll be called if the connection get
suspended but not necessarily broken you
might want to catch some information
when you succeed in making a connection
to location services location services
called back to unconnected telling you
that you're now connected to the
services and in the case of something
like location you'll then create a
location request they had passed the
location services to get your location
details back and it would call you back
with on location changed letting you
know that your location request details
have changed and there's new location
information available to you and you'll
get a location object which you can then
use to write to your screen so in the
application that we just saw that
location object included a latitude and
I was able to update my screen and write
the latitude to it now this programming
model isn't just limited to location
services as I've said many of the
services that you'll be using during
this course you follow a very similar
programming model to this you're going
to have a nun create and a non start you
can have a Google API client that you
connect to the services that you want to
use and then you have to handle certain
overrides usually they'll be on
connection failed on connection
suspended unconnected and then an
override that's specific to the services
that you're using in this case it's on
location changed for location services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
