evaluation I want to take another look
at the connections between the various
subproblems this network is called a
butterfly Network because the
connections over here on the Left look a
little like a butterfly also note that
there is a unique shortest path between
all nodes on the right and those on the
left another thing to note is that this
sequence of evens and odds on the
subscripts of these polynomials can be
translated to binary with ease being
translated to zeroes and OHS being
translated to ones and these numbers
then tell us which coefficient of the
original polynomial to return here and
this makes sense because when we chose
the even coefficients we were choosing
those that had 0 in the lowest order bit
and when we chose the odd coefficients
here we were choosing those with 1 in
the lowest order bit it will also be
instructive to write out the power
applied to Omega here on the right hand
side it turns out that these numbers on
the left act as instructions for any
path to this node from the right and
these numbers on the right act as
instructions for how to get there from
any node on the left
let's go right-to-left first reading
this bit sequence on the right we find
that 0 tells us to go the even route
first that is the higher of these paths
everywhere then the 1 tells us to go to
the lower route towards the odds and
then the last one again tells us to go
the lower route towards the odds and
indeed that provides instructions for
going from all of these nodes over here
to this one over here the reverse is
analogous we think about the least
significant bit first so to get to 6
going from here to here we go to the
Omega that has the lower of the possible
powers and then in the next step we go
towards the one that has the higher of
the possible powers of Omega in all
these cases and the same thing on the
last step
and going towards the higher power of
Omega which is the downward of these
paths this network is well worth some
study it serves as an important example
in graph theory and the topology here
has been used on some massively parallel
computers for their memory architecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
