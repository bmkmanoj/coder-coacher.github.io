three options and I'm going to walk
through backwards to talk about why
they're all so vital to our chronometer
that we want to make even if our device
repeats itself and does so in a
consistent manner if we don't know how
long those repetitions take well what
good is it if 10 ticks of our clock
correspond to 10 seconds or 15 or 20 but
we just don't know well that's not a
very useful clock obviously it has to be
isochronous if one tick of the clock is
one second in the next is seven seconds
well again a useless clock and all of
these require that something be
happening over and over at regular
intervals which means periodic well it
would be nice if our clock could run
forever without power if you know how to
make a clock that does this you've just
invented a perpetual motion machine and
send me the diagram please now it's
really cool is there's a whole field of
physics dedicated to phenomena the meet
this criteria simple harmonic motion
underlying this field of study simple
harmonic motion is the concept of
equilibrium so let's talk about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
