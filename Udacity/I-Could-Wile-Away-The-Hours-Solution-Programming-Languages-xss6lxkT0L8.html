loop to our JavaScript interpreter that
works just as it does in Python to get
acquainted here's some JavaScript code
that writes out 0 2 &amp;amp; 4 as you may have
guessed we test the expression if the
expression which is known as the
condition is true then we evaluate the
loop body after evaluating the loop body
we test the conditional expression again
if it's still true then we evaluate the
loop body and we continue this process
until the conditional expression is
false at which point we continue on
after the while loop so a while loop is
a type of statement that has the keyword
while and expression and then a compound
statement a sequence of statements in
our parse tree this will be represented
as a tuple where the first element is
the string while to indicate that this
is a while loop second element is the
expression the condition that determines
whether or not we execute the loop body
and the last element of the tuple is the
sequence of statements that comprise the
loop body so I want to tell you two ways
to solve this the first is going to
reuse the Python while and the second is
going to implement the while loop
recursively recall that in a programming
language you can have either a while
loop or recursive calls and still be
equally powerful and so we're going to
use that fact to implement our while
with recursion and here's one solution
the first two lines extract the
conditional expression and the loop body
from the parse tree and then we simply
plug in the conditional expression and
the loop body into a Python while loop
so while the conditional expression is
true we're going to execute the loop
body pretty straightforward and here's
my recursive solution the first two
lines are copyright out of the Python
while implementation where we extract
the conditional expression and the loop
body in the same way we then evaluates
the truthiness our conditional
expression if a conditional expression
is true we execute the statements in the
wild loop and then recurse on eval while
think about it for a moment
keep evaluating eval while until the
conditional expression is false under
this environment when it is false or if
it ever is false we simply don't do
anything which is exactly the same
functionality we had with the while loop
implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
