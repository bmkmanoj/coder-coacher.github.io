provides a clear system image what if
you were in a meeting room or cafeteria
where someone was having a heart attack
the room had a heart defibrillator on
the wall what you're seeing here but
let's say you had never seen or used one
before what would you do
those who design the device aren't
present no medical personnel or trained
responders are around and anxious
helpers don't have time to read a manual
not even a simple one here's a product
where designers have to communicate the
proper model of operation quickly so
what you're seeing here is the solution
the design firm IDEO came up with four
differed relators the device walks users
through three steps each clearly marked
and numbered the screen visible here
with the number two gives specific
instructions as users are interacting
with the device and as you can see from
this diagram two electrodes need to be
placed on the patient and the diagram
clearly communicates where they need to
be placed it's pretty straight board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
