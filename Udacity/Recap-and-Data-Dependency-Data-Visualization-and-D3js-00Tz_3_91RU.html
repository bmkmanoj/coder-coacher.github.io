bound them and they were on the page
they had no x or y position radius or
fill color so what this chunk of code
basically says in English is for each
data point our circle change its
exposition according to its date and
it's Y position according to its
attendance add an attribute of radius in
this case it's a radius of 3 as we set
previously and fill it with a color in
this case blue before we move on I just
want to make one more point but the
anonymous accessor functions or go over
rather a different way of looking at
them while you can think of these as any
other function it takes some input in
this case D which corresponds to an
individual row from our data and give
some output in this case for the
exposition a pixel value returned from
the time scale I often like to think of
the accessor functions as analogous to
the properties of a class for folks who
are comfortable with object-oriented
programming or in a more simple sense
simply a variable in this case the
accessor function for setting the
exposition returns a variable value
depending on what data point gets passed
into it so again while you can put some
logic to transform your data or perform
some other actions inside of the
accessor function typically I only use
in the sense of pulling out some data
and returning some value that's
dependent on that value I've pulled out
so in mostly uses of these anonymous
accessor functions in d3 it's often
useful to think of them as some data
dependent value based on what the bound
data is the accessor function should
return some value derived from the data
and again this allows us to customize
each function for each data point in
this case for data one place at the
exposition of datum one state for datum
to place at the exposition
datum Tuesday and so forth all the way
to datum 836 or however many pieces of
data you have in your data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
