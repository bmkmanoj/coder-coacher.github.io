doing all that talking mutations really
sobering so I just kind of came out here
to relax and yeah but you realize
something like causes all kinds of
mutations right Matt I can't get away
from it what are you talking about and
of course like UV light from the Sun is
a major source of induced mutations
there's UVA UVB rays from the Sun they
directly cause mutations it can cause
other molecules to indirectly cause
mutations in fact if you've ever had a
sunburn before where your skin cells
turn red and then peel off it's because
you've got so many mutations that your
body couldn't fix them all and so they
committed cell suicide to save you from
skin cancer it's a good thing that I
wore sunscreen today but I really wish
my skin would just protect itself on its
own well there's actually a mechanism
for that it's actually skin pigmentation
so you say if I had darker skin tone I
would be a susceptible to skin cancer
exactly let's let's go learn a bit more
about how that works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
