imagery captured what basically comes
out now is we're no longer in the range
of 0 to 255 this output basically shows
that this image now has a range from
0.62 one five to twelve thousand 871
intensity all of the dark blue colors
that you see are close to this one all
of the bright red and of course you need
a bright red here and you actually
notice that there's a little bit of
yellow because this you notice in the
image this was kind of getting very
bright too but you see a lot of detail
and there there is kind of really bright
spots there are there of course now we
need to study how are we going to take
this radiance map and create an image
before we go there we need to also think
a little bit about what kinds of file
formats we can use to save images like
this now that radience image I showed
you right needs to be stored somewhere
so far we've been always interested in
trying to say okay I'm going to have 8
bits per red 8 bits for green and 8 bits
for blue well now we need a newer form
of an image 32 bits per pixel because
now we want to actually create 8 bits of
additional information this was 24 bits
8 bits per color so we're gonna add an
exponent math works out the following
way basically it means it's now if I
have an RGB value of 145 to 1587 I'm
gonna actually add another exponent
number here and what this exponent
basically does is takes the RGB values
multiplies with the 2 raised to the
difference of 149 minus 128 128 was
again remember to do 0 to 256 or 255
that divide by and of course this gives
us values much bigger than 0 255 just by
adding this 8 bit of information of
course the other way is also there
rather than take this value I can
subtract that the 103 this information
from 128 this is this value here and now
I have much smaller numbers so now this
allows us to go from very small numbers
and all the way up to large numbers and
of course this format can be used to
save an image like this into a file
this is a proposed representation of a
file format from Ward there are many
other similar formats I do encourage you
to look at radians mapped formats on the
web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
