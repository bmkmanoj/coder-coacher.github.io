inference attack with the database that
was defined by the scheming that we just
discussed query that we're going to
consider here is a query that returns
the average score on an exam ok so any
student should be able to find out in
fact that's like the first question
after an exam when you bring back the
grades students ask what was the average
so any student should be able to submit
a query that returns the average of the
score on that exam and average basically
is we take every student's grade some
sum it up and then divided by the number
of students and you know that should
tell us anything about a particular
student remember what you're not
authorized to access it somebody else is
great this is an authorized query and
our idea of inference attack is that
you're going to use a query like this to
gain access to information that you
normally are not allowed to see if
you're an attacker your goal would be to
gain access to information that is not
available to you so that would be to
find the exact score of some other
student it's not your score that you
already know but if you are an outsider
of course you're targeting a particular
student and you want to find out his or
her exact score that's the goal of that
hacker or the information that we want
to want the attacker to get access to
inference attacks sometimes requires
some additional outside or external
information so maybe the attacker does
know when somebody takes some person
takes the exam late could be because
they were sick or something like that so
the whole class took the exam on a
certain date and after a few days after
that perhaps this student is going to
take the exam and this information is
about available to that hacker so that
hacker is going to do in this case is
run the average school query before this
one student the one who takes the exam
wait actually you know takes the exam
and his or her score is added to the
database before the exam is taken the
score may be zero or something like that
and after the exam is replaced by the
correct value so that hacker is running
the average query which we said
should be allowed before this one
student takes the exam and that hacker
knows when the student has taken the
exam
maybe tries a few times eventually sees
maybe a different average value or after
certain amount of time we know that you
know the exam must have been taken by
everyone including this one student who
had missed it earlier so it does the
average again okay so now I have two
averages let's say the student is Alice
so the average score not including Alice
and then average score of everyone that
includes Alice well based on these two
values that are returned by this query
that is allowed I can now figure out
what Alice's averages actually it's
fairly easy to do that if they're n
number of students the total score if
you add them all up is n times the
average so here since Alice hasn't taken
so it'll be N minus 1 times the average
the score before the total of the scores
before and this is after Alice takes the
exam the difference is Alice's great
exactly okay so the idea here is that
these two queries both are allowed
because they return the average the
database system allows that hacker to
run each one of these queries by running
these queries at particular times have
to be you have to think through when
exactly you want to do that we are able
to make an inference and find the exact
value of the target score just by the
difference that I just mentioned so this
is the example of an inference attack
where you use authorized queries to gain
access to information that you not
authorized for so which is the exact
score of the target in this case the
target was Alice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
