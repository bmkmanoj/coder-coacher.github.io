the access control matrix this is what
we want to discuss so first of all the
access control matrix is going to pretty
large there could be tons of resources
depending on what kind of system you
have it's a large shared server there
could be lots of users so it's a large
matrix but we know that the matrix is
going to be fairly sparse so sparse
matrix here really means that many of
the entries in the matrix are going to
be null because most users not gonna
have access for a given resource
resource is owned by somebody he or she
is gonna have access to it and maybe
they choose to share it with a few other
people so the question is how should we
represent this matrix in the system
actually sparse matrices represented in
one of two ways you can represent them
either sort of a column major or row
major and that's something we can do
here in this case so we can sort of
focus on each column of the matrix and
if most of the entries are now we can
just sort of ignore those and we can
sort of make a list that says well for
object oh I user UI 1 this users access
rights are this value okay so this is
sort of we have these entries so when I
said you know matrices when they're
sparse they can be implemented through
linked lists for example so this could
be a list of and it's gonna have a small
number of entries because most users
don't have any access for object Y so if
a given user has access you know what
kind of access we can have sort of this
fair user ID and access rights that
makes up the first node in our list the
next user is gonna be UI - who has some
other set of rights and so on so we can
just sort of go down the column and see
what users actually have known now
access rights and sort of build these
entries that become nodes in a linked
list or something like that so we can
organize this information either by a
resource or an object here we'll have to
keep track of what users have access to
this object and what kind of access they
have for this object so that's one way
to do it when you do that this list I'm
talking about or the data structure that
we're talking about
this collection is linked list kind of a
data structure that's a collection of
these entries what user has access right
this is called an access control list or
an Akal so if you sort of focus on a
resource or object oh I and grab the
information who has access to this
resource and what kind of access that
defines an access control list or Akal
to keep in mind is that Ackles are for
resources we have in the system so Akal
is always associated with an object or a
resource there's another way to sort of
think about how we can implement it and
rather than sort of focusing on columns
we can focus on rows and we know that
rows correspond to users so we can go
down horizontally you know across a row
and say so what would we see if it's as
FAR's metrics this user UI is not going
to have access for most of the objects
but he or she will have access to some
objects so the first object we run into
for which UI has access is this object
oh I won so the list we're gonna
generate here is gonna say for this
given user UI we do have access and
these are the access rights for object
y1 the next object for which we have
access or this user UI has access is oh
I - and those exercise are defined by
rights - and so on
so basically we are ignoring the null
entries in the row and the entries that
are not null are for certain objects so
these are those objects and what kind of
access for each of those objects that's
what we capture in this list well this
kind of a list is called a capability
list in some sense what a user is
capable off a user is capable of
accessing oh I won in this manner why -
in that manner so it's called a
capability list that is for a given user
you I remember Eckles are for an object
capability lists are for a user again
see list is going to be associated with
each user we have in the system remember
we have a row in the access control
matrix for each user and each row really
is a c-list it's a list representation
of what's in that row so see lists are
for users Eckles are for objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
