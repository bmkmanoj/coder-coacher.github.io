of what I just said so remember I draw
squares as chance nodes and so chance
takes a chance and half the time we end
up in a state where I had where a has a
red card and half the time I end up in a
state where a has or we end up in a
state where a has a black card okay
if a has the black card then B gets to
choose whether to hold or not so okay
let me add a little bit of color for you
since you wanted some color this is the
place where a gets to make a decision
okay yep and then this is the place
where B gets to make a decision got it
okay so a is going to be either in a red
state or a black state only a knows this
B does not know this does not know what
state he is in and so let's say a is in
a black state well a can only hold in
that case in part because it makes no
sense to resign and then B gets to
decide whether to resign and therefore a
gets 10 cents or to C in which case a
gets 30 cents by contrast when we're in
the red state a can either hold a resign
if a resigns he loses 20 cents if a
holds then B gets to decide whether to
resign and which case a gets 10 cents or
to see the card in which case a loses 40
cents and B of course gains 40 cents so
this is just a tree version of what I
just wrote does that make sense okay
yeah I can see how this kind of captures
the flow of information but I feel like
there might be a missing constraint to
it so I don't know there's actually
constraint missing but let me just point
out something and that is that B has no
idea which of these two states he's in
hence hidden information and because B
doesn't know what state he's in he
doesn't know whether to resign or deceit
in particular being knew that he was in
this leftmost state then he would always
say C if he knew he was in the rightmost
State then he would always resign but he
doesn't know which one so it's not
entirely clear what to do need where did
you get this game this game is awesome I
got this game like I got all of the
examples that were using today from
Andrew Moore he's clever he is clever
and I have shamelessly stolen all of his
examples and materials for this but he
said it was okay by putting up slides in
the world and saying
feel free to steal all of this stuff do
you want to write his name so that
people can credit him yeah I'm gonna
write it at the very end when we talk
about what we've learned awesome okay so
here's a question for you Michael we
know that I wrote down a bunch of words
which describe the game and then I made
it a tree because I could do that and it
makes it nice and easy to see what's
going on but now we know that at least
based on everything else we've done we
want to make a little matrix and so we
want to figure out what the value is for
different strategies for a and B so I'm
going to assert and I think it's pretty
easy to see I hope that a basically has
only two strategies either a is the type
of person who resigns when a card is red
or a is the type of person who holds
when a card is red okay yeah right so it
really is a conditional policy right so
it's it's basically if red hold a resign
if black holder resigned but your point
is that black isn't really a choice red
is a choice and there's only two choices
okay I can see that it's the the two
strategy sure right and of course this
does say this this is kind of that's
kind of say when you're in the black
case you know you're gonna hold so you
know what's going to happen ultimately B
can either be the kind of person who
resigns whenever a holds or chooses to
see whenever a holds right
I see so like in the previous trees it B
would have four different strategies
resign or see in the Left State resign
or see in the right State here there's
this kind of extra connection this sort
of quantum entanglement between these
two states that makes them have to be
the same so there really is just those
two choices
that's exactly right although I probably
wouldn't have used the phrase quantum
entanglement but yes there's an
entanglement certainly does we can't
tell which state we're in you're either
going to resign or you're gonna see and
you just don't know what else to do okay
so hazel resigner or a holder B's a
resigned er or a seer so the question is
what numbers go in this matrix and we're
going to figure that out by having a
quiz I kind of saw that coming mmm-hmm
do you think you can figure this out
yeah yeah sure sure yeah I think so yeah
see see see do it okay cool so let's go
then go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
