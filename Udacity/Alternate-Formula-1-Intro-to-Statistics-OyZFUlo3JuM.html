mean and the variance and it should now
look very familiar
the problem with that is that they
require two passes through the data
first I have to go through all the data
and compute the mean I do this by
summing up all the data and dividing it
by the total number of data items for
that I maintain two things I maintain
the total number of data items which I
increment every time I see a new data
item and I maintain the sum of all
excise which I can easily add up as I go
through the data and once I've done this
I know Mew and then I can finally plug
it in here but now I have to go through
the data again and compute this guy so
you can finally get to my covariance now
I'm going to teach you a trick now but
which we don't maintain this guy but
instead maintain just this guy the nice
thing about this is if you maintain
these three things you only need a
single pass to see as we go through the
data we can maintain the number of data
items that we have we can maintain the
sum over here we can maintain the sum of
the data themselves and we can maintain
simultaneously the sum of the square of
the data items but it's not obvious that
from these three things alone you can
figure out what Sigma square is so let's
play a game and the way the game works
is that I put a number of mathematic
expressions here on the right side and I
start the derivation and leave little
gaps and I'll ask you to pick one of
those and plug them into the equation
you can only use each of those ones but
we won't use all of them just a subset
slip into the first step by hand and
rewrite Sigma square by factoring out
the square and I can rewrite this by
multiplying things out so help me what
do you think goes in the middle which
are those expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
