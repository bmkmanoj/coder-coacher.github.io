successful we then move to the
construction phase which is our third
phase and the construction phase is
basically the phase in which most of the
actual development occurs in short all
the features consider are developed so
we'll continue with our car metaphor
that we use for the prototype and in
this case we will have our complete car
ready not only the features are
developed but they're also fully tested
so we have performed that quality
assurance we have verified and validated
the software the system and we know that
it works correctly or at least that it
works correctly as far as we can tell so
in general the construction phase is the
phase in which there is a shift in
emphasis from intellectual property
development to product development from
ideas to products so what is the outcome
of the construction phase or basically
the construction phase produces a
product that is ready to be deployed to
the users specifically the phase
generates the following outcomes well
first of all at the end of this phase
all the use cases have been realized
with traceability information what does
that mean it means that not only all the
functionality expressed by the use cases
have been implemented but also that we
have traceability information from the
use cases to the different artifacts so
for example we know which part of the
design realizes which is Kaiser we know
which part of the implementation is
related to a given use case which test
cases were derived from a use case and
so on and so forth and in this way we
can trace our requirements throughout
the system throughout the different
artifacts they were developed during the
software process as we were saying we
also have complete software product here
which is integrated on all the needed
platforms since the system the software
product has to be thoroughly tested we
will also have a complete set of results
for our tests as part of this phase we
will also finalize the user manual so we
will have a user manual ready to be
provided to the users and ready to be
used
and finally we will have a complete set
of artifacts that include design
documents code the test cases and so on
and so forth so basically all of the
artifacts that have been produced during
the development process so roughly
speaking we can consider the product
that is produced at the end of this
phaser as a typical beta release so in
case you're not familiar with that a
beta release is an initial released
meant for a selected subset of users so
this something is not quite yet
ready for primetime but almost so let's
see also in this case would are the
evaluation criteria for the construction
phase so how do we assess that this
third milestone has been accomplished
successfully we pretty much have a
complete product ready to be shipped
right so the first question we want to
ask is whether the product is stable and
mature enough to be deployed to users at
the end of this phase it has to be
are they stakeholders ready for the
transition into the user community are
we ready to go from development to
production are the actual resource
expenditures versus the planned
expenditures still acceptable so what
this means is that at this point we can
really assess whether our estimates were
accurate enough with respect to what we
actually spent for the project up to
this point so unless we can answer in a
positive way to all these questions the
transition might be postponed by one
release because that means that we're
still not ready to go to the market
we're still not ready to deploy our
product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
