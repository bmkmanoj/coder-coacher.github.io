this unit is look at three particular
protocols we're gonna get the encrypted
key exchange protocol we're gonna look
at SSH for setting up a secure shell and
we'll look at TLS which is the most
widely used cryptographic protocol today
that's the protocol that's used every
time someone connects to a secure web
site using HTTPS all of these has some
things in common they all have the goal
of authenticating a client and a server
this could be in either direction or in
both directions it could be to allow a
client to know that they're talking to
the right server it could be an to allow
a server to know that they're talking to
the right client it could be the
mutually authenticate both parties and
they all involve a mix of asymmetric and
symmetric techniques what I hope you get
from seeing the three different
protocols is a sense of some of the
things that are the same that their
techniques that all the protocols have
in common at some level but there are
also differences between the protocols
the things that led to those decisions
and why the protocols have different
properties we'll start by talking about
encrypted key exchange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
