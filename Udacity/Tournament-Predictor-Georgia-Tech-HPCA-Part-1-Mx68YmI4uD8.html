tournament predictor the idea is that
you have two predictors one is better
for some branches the other is better
for other branches now what you want to
do is to get the best behavior for all
types of branches so what you want to do
is when you have these branches use the
first predictor when you have these
branches use the second predictor but
you don't know which branches are going
to benefit from which of your two
predictors ahead of time so what you
really have is your two predictors let's
say that they're G share and P share you
will use your PC of the branch to index
into both of the predictors you will
take the decisions that they generate
and now you need to decide which one to
use how do you do that and the idea of a
tournament predictor is to use a so
called meta predictor which is just an
array of two bit counters you also use
the PC to index there and the entry of
the meta predictor does not tell you a
prediction for the branch it tells you
which of the two predictors is the more
likely to give an accurate prediction
for that branch so what you do is you
use this to choose among the two
decisions so pretty much this meta
predictor gives you a way to select
among the two decisions so that the
final outcome is the decision that the
meta predictor thinks is a better
prediction you train the individual
predictors just like before on every
branch outcome you train each of the
predictors you train the meta predictor
a little bit differently instead of
counting up when taken and counting down
we're not taken the meta predictor is
instead trained on how well these two
are doing if your two predictors are
both correct
then your meta predictor doesn't change
anything if you're first predictor like
in this case your G share is correct but
the other one is not then you count down
counting down will result in selecting
the G share result more often if your
first predictor is wrong but your second
predictor is right then you count up
counting up will result in choose
this prediction more often and finally
if both of them are wrong then the meta
predictor doesn't change because again
there is no benefit in trying to select
one over the other so the idea of the
meta predictor is that the prediction
bit of the two bit counter is telling
you really which of these to select the
hysteresis is there just in case G share
is overall the more accurate but
sometimes pitcher beats it or the other
way around and again each branch has its
own meta predictor entry so this type of
decision and this type of selection is
done dependant on branches so pretty
much for here for example loop exit
branch it might be that the pshare works
better for your correlated branches it
might be that the G share works better
and they will have different meta
predictor entries so that they will use
different predictors for their outcomes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
