three main things right we have a
message in the space of all messages we
have a cypher text in the space of all
ciphertext and we have a key in the
space of all possible keys and we want
our encryption function we'll take a
message and a key and map that to a
cipher text and our decryption function
will take a ciphertext and a key and map
that to a message and to be correct we
need to obtain the same message after
decryption we need to know for all
messages and keys we have the property
the decrypting using that key and I'm
going to use the notation where I put
the key as a subscript to the decryption
function instead of as an input but that
means the same thing as saying there are
two inputs to decryption one is the key
what is the input ciphertext and the
input ciphertext is the result of
encrypting using that same key that
message and we want to know for
correctness that that value must always
be the message that was input to the
encryption function correctness of
course is not enough we also want
security and our security property in an
ideal sense would be that the cipher
text reveals nothing at all about the
key or the message we're gonna formalize
this a little later this unit for now
let's think about that property
informally and what I'm gonna ask you is
a quiz to see whether given functions
satisfy our correctness property so now
it's time for a quiz to see that you
understand the correctness property for
a symmetric cipher which of the
functions below satisfy the correctness
property for a symmetric cipher and
we'll assume both the message space the
set of all possible messages and the key
space the set of all possible keys are
the natural numbers so the whole numbers
starting from 1 so each choice is a pair
of functions the encryption function and
the decryption function for the first
choice the encryption function adds the
message and the key for this decryption
function we subtract from the cipher
text the key for the second choice the
encryption function is the identity the
decryption function is like
on the ciphertext for the third choice
I'm using the modulo operator X modulo Y
is the remainder you get when you divide
X by Y and modulo is a very useful
operation in cryptography we'll see that
quite a bit later on this unit as well
as in later units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
