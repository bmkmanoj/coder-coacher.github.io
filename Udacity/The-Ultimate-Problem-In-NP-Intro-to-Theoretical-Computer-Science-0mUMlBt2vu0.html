time reductions imagine that we had one
problem in NP such that every other
problem that is also an NP could be
reduced to it so we would have vertex
cover which could be reduced to that
problem we would have independent set
which could be reduced to that problem
and also clique of course and any other
problem in NP as well so no matter how
complicated that problem as long as it's
NP that means on a non-deterministic Ram
you can solve it in polynomial time
there exists a polynomial time reduction
to this ultimate problem and such a
problem actually has a name so if you
could find a problem in NP such that any
other problem in NP is just as hard to
solve or easier to solve then that
problem is called np-complete because in
a way it represents all of the problems
in NP because if it's a problem that any
other problem can be reduced to an
np-complete problem is basically capable
of solving or representing all other
problems that are contained in NP so and
then P complete problem is contained in
NP and the important part here is that
really any other problem in NP can be
reduced to it so not just vertex cover
and adjust independent set not just
click but any problem that lies in NP
can be reduced to that problem so let's
have a little quiz to familiarize
yourself with a concept of NP
completeness so I have three statements
here about np-complete problems and I
would like you to tell me which one of
these is true there can be more than one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
