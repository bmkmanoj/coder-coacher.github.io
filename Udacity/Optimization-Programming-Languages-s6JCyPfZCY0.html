understanding of how to check that our
program is correct and test it to gain
confidence let's talk about optimization
making our program faster over on the
right I've doodled The Tortoise and the
hare you can tell this is a hair and not
let's say mutated donkey because of the
label those labels are always correct
and this bears reference to one of
Aesop's fables Greek writer from times
long ago in which the hair although in
some sense faster was relatively lazy
and was eventually beaten out by the
tortoise in the real world performance
matters we've heard for example that if
you don't render a webpage in six
seconds or less shoppers will go to
another website for the vast majority of
applications things in this class
airline auto pilots banking transactions
things related to energy or power or
transportation performance matters less
than correctness job one test it debug
it get the right answer job to make it
fast in this sense optimization refers
to improving the performance of our code
can we make our web browser take less
time to render the same web pages a lot
of modern interpreters from JavaScript
interpreters to Python use a technique
known as just-in-time improvement which
is sometimes abbreviated as JIT to fix
up or improve code right before they run
it so that it's faster but gets the same
output so our basic optimization idea is
going to be to replace the input web
page the HTML or JavaScript fragment
with one that takes less time to process
but has and this is super critical I
cannot emphasize this enough exactly the
same meaning we must produce the same
output with optimizations on and with
optimizations off aside from the time it
takes we absolutely can't change the
meaning we have to be correct and in
that sense optimization for programming
languages is somewhat similar to editing
for conciseness in natural languages if
you say something redundant and it's
possible to remove that redundancy
without changing the meaning you can
strike it from written text we're going
to do the same thing with optimization
here I've written JavaScript code to
compute the factorial function and this
code is correct of course as soon as I
say that there's going to be one minor
typo but let's just assert that this
code is correct it actually computes
factorial but it's a little slower than
it needs to be you may have noticed that
I wrote 1 times n times factorial of n
minus 1 instead of just n times
factorial of n minus 1 this is correct
multiplying something by one doesn't
change its meaning but it's slower than
necessary if we're talking about
arithmetic whenever you see 1 times n
you could just replace it by n and now
you're saving time because we are
removing notes from our abstract syntax
tree this means it takes less time to do
our recursive walk and interpret it and
we have fewer multiplications and
multiplication is an arithmetic
operation that the CPU has to perform it
takes some amount of time and in fact
especially in something like factorial
if I'm asking for the factorial of 10
we're going to call this function a
large number of times so even though it
may not seem like I'm saving much I save
it every time we're in this loop and
this is why I suggested earlier that
performing such a simplification or
optimization is like editing someone's
writing so that it's more concise if I
just edit that part away this factorial
is still correct just takes a little
less time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
