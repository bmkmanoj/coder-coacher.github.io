solved it's important to know what data
is needed and what data is available the
second step in the framework is
understanding the data having a mental
model of the business issue will be
helpful in determining what factors are
likely to drive demand tomorrow for
example some factors that are likely to
be important are the day of the week as
well as the month and the year it'll
also be useful to know the hour of the
day and the temperature at that hour and
maybe even the preceding hour so we're
trying to predict electricity usage but
don't know what the temperature will be
tomorrow we'll need to make predictions
about the temperature at any given hour
now that we have some ideas around our
data needs we can start to explore data
factors that will help us predict hourly
temperatures in this scenario we may
look at the forecasted high and low
temperatures from the National Weather
Service the number of minutes from
sunrise to the start of each hour and
the temperature for the same hour the
previous day the available data will be
important in deciding the types of
methodologies that may be used
additionally a solid understanding of
the data is important to ensure proper
analysis for example if you have a data
field that shows a number of employees
per month it may be important to know if
the value represents the number of
employees at the beginning of the month
at the end of the month or the average
of the number of employees at the
beginning and end of the month an
improper understanding of the data may
result in an incorrect analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
