one can write a program that can handle
any mix of quiz questions let's try that
out and develop another question type a
numeric question expects an answer from
the user that's a number for example
here we ask what is the area of a circle
with radius 1 and the answer is of
course pi well that might be hard to
enter we can't really expect the user to
type in the exact value of pi and as you
know this is not even the exact value
either it goes on forever we just want
the user to be able to enter say 3.14 or
3.14159 depending on how well they
remember those digits either one of
those answers should be fine
in fact we'll take any answer that's up
to 0.01 away from the answer that the
user provides in a different American we
might use a different tolerance your
task is to implement this new question
type we've given you the constructor
your job is to provide the set answer
method and the check answer method in
the check answer method you need to take
the tolerance into account you need to
check whether the given number is not
too far away from the response so
technical issue the response is a string
you need to convert it to a number and
we show you here how to do that you may
need additional instance variables and
then you should put them here go ahead
