just pretending I'm inside a cell and I
just transcribed a gene and so I've got
the RNA and now I'm cutting and pasting
all the exons together but how do you
know where to cut oh well that's easy
because the exons and introns are
colored here the exons are in purple and
the introns are in orange and I'm
essentially taking and cutting out the
introns and keeping the exons so we keep
the exons but we get rid of the introns
exactly I know it sounds kind of
counterintuitive but we keep the exons
and we cut out the introns so that's why
the mRNA is shorter than the gene
because we're actually getting rid of
some of the gene sequence except for the
ones that only have one exon right
that's exactly right now most genes have
more than one exon there are a few that
have only one but those genes that have
more than one exon have to cut out all
those introns in a process called
splicing that's what splicing is is we
cut out splice out the introns and we
splice together all the exons can we
infer anything about the number of
introns and exons based on the length of
the mRNA so I want you to tell me here -
mrna is made from their respective genes
here's a DNA gene and the mRNA copy that
resulted another DNA gene and it's mRNA
copy that resulted after transcription I
want you to tell me for both examples
how many axons do you think are in each
gene so here are the genes on the left
and right and beneath them with mRNA
copies and just to be clear on the left
the mRNA copy is the exact length as the
DNA gene and over here on the right the
mRNA copy is shorter than the DNA gene
so using the options below for each
scenario I want you to pick the best
answer for the question how many exons
do you think are in each gene this is a
tough one so think about it first and
try again if you don't get it the first
go-round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
