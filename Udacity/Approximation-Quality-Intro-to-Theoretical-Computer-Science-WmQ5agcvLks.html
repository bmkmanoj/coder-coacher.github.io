quality because obviously even though
you've decided that you're content with
a solution that is not optimal you still
want to ensure a certain quality of your
solution and we'll be looking at two
different types of approximation
algorithm in this unit the one the first
one is called a constant factor
approximation and what a constant factor
approximation is well as the name says
they have some constant C so when you
have an optimization problem where you
want to minimize some quantity this
algorithm will guarantee you a solution
that is no worse than C times the best
possible solution for a minimization
problem your solution will be less than
or equal to C times the optimum or the
best possible solution and that is a
guarantee that this constant factor
approximation gives you so this is for
minimization and for maximization so a
minimization problem you're trying to
find this point here for a maximization
problem you're trying to find this point
here basically your solution is at least
as good as one over C times the optimum
so let's do a quick quiz to practice
this so say you have a factor two
approximation algorithm which means that
C equals two so you have a factor two
approximation algorithm for vertex cover
you run the algorithm on an input and it
returns to you a vertex cover of size
100 and of course this is a correct
answer
so it is indeed a vertex cover we just
don't know if it's the smallest possible
vertex cover because we're using an
approximation algorithm what I would
like you to tell me now is two things
first of all what is the maximum number
of vertices in an optimum solution and
please enter your answer here and what
is the minimum number of vertices in an
optimum solution and please enter this
number here in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
