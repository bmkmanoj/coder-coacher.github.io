to do this I've created a simple
unstyled web page this web page
showcases my top three favorite books of
all time if you couldn't tell I'm a big
survival and adventure fan let's try to
add some styling to this web page
I've opened the HTML file and using tag
selectors we could write some CSS that
selects all the h1 tags h2 tags or
paragraph tags but what if we wanted to
add style to the book summaries but not
the site description at the top using
tag selectors we can only select all
paragraph tags so what do we do
thankfully we have a few more ways to
select HTML elements with CSS besides
using tags instead we can use attributes
I'm going to change my HTML file to
demonstrate how this works all right so
now I've reloaded my new HTML file with
a few changes if we look at the fall
I've added this ID attribute site
description to my first paragraph and if
we look at the rest of the paragraphs I
have this class book summary these two
attributes are extremely helpful
first because attributes help us
describe the content of the page inside
the HTML markup you can now clearly see
that the first paragraph on my web page
is my site description now keep in mind
ID should be used sparingly that's
because an HTML element can only have
one ID and IDs can only be used once per
page for example if I type another ID
this is not okay because I'm passing two
IDs site description and another ID to
the same element if I add the ID site
description here this is also not ok
because now I'm using site description
in two places if I wanted to add an ID
here I need to give it another name that
has not already been used if I change
the ID to first book then that would be
okay generally when you're styling your
page you'll be styling collections of
elements not individual elements if you
want to add the same attribute to
multiple HTML elements use classes
instead like I've done here for books
summer
classes can be added to multiple HTML
elements and HTML elements can have
multiple classes
this makes classes extremely powerful
and flexible you will use them
constantly as a web developer and most
web developers prefer classes over IDs
besides organisation these attributes
can be used as CSS selectors if I
revisit my question from before I wanted
to style my book summaries differently
than my site description here at the top
using the ID and class selectors I can
easily do that for book summaries they
use the class attribute and in order to
select an HTML element with a class
attribute I'll type a period followed by
the name of the class for the site
description it uses an ID attribute in
order to select an HTML element with an
ID attribute I'll type a pound sign or
hash tag followed by the name of the ID
okay good finally I'll add some quick
styling to make sure our selectors work
let's change the property color to blue
for a book summary and let's change the
property color to red for our site
description okay
now I'll save and refresh and perfect we
can see that the site description and
the book summaries are different colors
so our selectors worked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
