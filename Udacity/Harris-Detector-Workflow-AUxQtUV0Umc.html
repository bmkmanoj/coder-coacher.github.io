simply using these two image pairs now
if you notice these two image pairs the
object of interest has significantly
changed but some of the local details
are of course the same I mean you know
this is the same toy drive and you know
we can basically see some of the details
even though of course some of the
details is significantly different also
in this case just to prove a point and
the intensities are also different first
of course by running through and we
basically now want to come up and
compute the corner response function as
we've looked at for this image this
basically starts giving us all of these
responses and I've just color map them a
little bit to kind of point out where
the higher cost functions are which are
all of the bright red ones and that's
where most of the interesting corners
are being found in this image and again
they're found in both these image pairs
of course now we can actually take those
bright spots and find points with the
largest or no response in essence now
that basically says I know what the R
value is I'm going to threshold out and
get rid of everything else that's below
certain threshold that allows me to find
these regions again in both of them that
are just a higher rate or higher
intensity of ours this image should be
hard for you to see because the points
are not very small in here let's start
to zoom in but basically this is finding
the local maximum of each and every
point that we had looked at and again at
this scale to get to be really small
let's zoom in and if you zoom in you
should be able to see some simple white
spots all over this image don't fret if
you don't see them because what I've
done now is basically just use contrast
management and now you can see these
points here of course there's still kind
of hard to see so let's look at them
overlaid so in this case now I've
basically taken the same image again
pair and here you can see small red
points here course some are found here
that region is not there so of course
they're not found here but you can see
for example there are some features at
the nose there are some features at the
tips up there and you can see similar
features and actually now you can start
seeing that it found features here and
here and also found features for example
here and there even though the image is
a little
so this is the output we're looking at
we want to find features like this
that's what we want to do for the Harris
detection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
