databases because this model is what the
databases that are widely used Oracle
for example the databases that are
widely used in real world they actually
use this relational model so that's one
reason we're going to focus on it it's
also been round and investigated heavily
and so on so what is a relational
database what's the data model here well
a relational database consists of what
is called relations another name for
relation is a table remember a table is
basically sort of like rows and columns
it's a matrix kind of a structure so a
relation is nothing but sort of a table
that has a bunch of columns and bunch of
rows so what columns we have what kind
of data items you're going to have in
the various columns in the database
oriented relation that's defined by a
schema that we have for that relation
schema basically says what each column
is and what is the nature of the data is
it a name it's an address it's a Social
Security number whatever it is the
columns defined by what we call
attributes so the values that we store
in in the various columns actually are
attribute values think about the schema
defines for these various columns of the
table are or the various attributes are
and value for a given attribute is the
attribute value we talked about columns
or attributes but of course then we have
rows in a table the given row is going
to contain value for each of the
attributes as defined by the schema that
we are talking about so it's column row
so cell of a matrix or a table basically
has a value so these rows are called
tuples so tuples basically as it said
our values attribute values that make up
that row of the table and what these
values are again is defined by the
schema that we have it's a table and in
their attribute values and the rows are
called tuples and things like that you
know some of those attribute values are
kind of special they called keys the
various types of keys primary and
foreign and stuff like
that but keys are basically values that
uniquely define a given couple or a row
so if your database stores information
about each employee there's going to be
a couple for each employee information
about that employee is going to be
stored in the table or the relation
given employees information will define
one tuple and if you identify employees
by let's say their social security
number then that's going to be the key
value in that tupple and it's uniquely
identifies that double because social
security numbers are different for
different users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
