hard we try our programs have bugs in
the olden days computers had real bugs
for example the moth that you see here
got trapped in a relay off the very
first computer in the United States
causing a to malfunction but of course
nowadays the bugs are usually the fault
of the programmer by not having thought
through everything and that's normal you
can find simple bugs by putting print
statements into your code printing out
everything inside seeing what goes wrong
and then removing the print statements
again but that's no fun there's a nifty
software tool called the debugger that
you can use to control your program stop
it and look around and then find out
what it actually does as opposed to what
you think it's been doing using a
debugger is pretty simple there are
three key concepts that you need a
master you can set breakpoints in your
program and then the debugger will stop
when the program reaches a breakpoint
you can then step through your program
one instruction at a time and you can
even step inside method calls and
finally you can inspect the contents of
variables so if you have a variable you
can ask the debugger what's inside at
this point so these are the three key
concepts that you want to keep in mind
let me show you how to do these in bluej
this example program tries to count the
syllables in a word let me show you I'll
enter a few words and as you can see the
program doesn't seem to be doing so well
hell-lo has two syllables not one yellow
also has two or peach has one before
debugging this program let's have a
quick look at what algorithm is used to
count the syllables here is our
algorithm we look for groups of vowels
as one here another group of length one
and another one and we count the groups
this word has three syllables however
here we'll count this group but we won't
count an e at the end because nice only
has one syllable that second rule trips
us up with some very short words such as
we're not counting the e would give us
zero syllables and we'll say if that
happens we'll change the count to one to
summarize we count vowel groups
but not a final E and if that count
gives us zero we change it to one now on
to seeing the debugger in
open the syllable counter program in
bluej and i really suggest that you do
that with me click in this column here
next to the first line of the main
method and you'll see a tiny stop sign
that's a breakpoint now run the program
in the usual way and now the debugger
wakes up we've hit this breakpoint and
what you see over here is the console
that controls the debugger these buttons
here let you step through the program
let's try it out which we can step and
you can see that we're now in the next
line we click on step again oh now it
has produced the output here and we're
back where the little arrow is now when
we step nothing seems to be happening
the arrow is gone that's because right
now we're reading input let's look at
the terminal window and here it is
waiting for the input
I'll just supply it now I hit enter and
you can see the debugger window again
and back here our program has advanced
by one step let's bring this to the
front and we'll pass here now to make
sure that you are trying this at home
let me ask you to do exactly what I did
set the breakpoint here enter hello
yellow peach keep signal stepping and
I'd like you to tell me how many times
are you hitting this line the call to
the constructor before you get out of
the loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
