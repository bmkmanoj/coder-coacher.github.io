denominator fantastic algebra skills if
you got these two correct this one was
really tough so don't worry if you to
get it right on your first try or even
at all let's see how we can multiply by
the LCD and simplify we know we're going
to multiply by the LCD / the LCD when we
do that we really just distribute this
to each term in our complex fraction
this gives us this expression now this
is pretty hideous so let's clean it up
we know X plus 2 divided by X plus 2
equals 1 so we're left with 3 times x
squared for our first term this next
multiplication was a little tricky we
have x squared divided by X we can only
cancel 1x from this power and this
denominator this means we have to drop
the square power down to a one and we're
left with 4 x 1 x times X plus 2 I want
to make sure i have negative 4 times 1 x
so i have negative 4x then i have x x
plus 2 here this denominator is a little
bit more simple these factors simplify
to 1 and these factors also simplify to
1 so we're left with 2 times x squared
for the first term of a denominator and
1 times X plus 2 or just X plus 2 for
the second term of our denominator i
need to multiply or distribute this
negative 4x to the quantity x + 2 this
gives me a new numerator for the
denominator I don't multiply I really
add since we have addition between these
two terms since there aren't any like
terms here I just list out each term 2x
squared plus X plus 2 and to finish out
we just simply combine the like terms in
our numerator 3x squared minus 4x
squared is negative x squared so here's
our final rational expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
