unit just having a huge number of
potential solutions of course does not
show that your problem is np-complete
but it can be an indicator if you cannot
come up with any substantially better
algorithm and so Dave currently cannot
come up with a substantially better
algorithm so he wonders could this
problem of shortest tour also be
np-complete and that's why together with
Dave we will now try to show that indeed
shortest tour is np-complete and to do
that we'll go through these two standard
steps here so first of all we have to
show that the problem of shortest tour
is in NP and to do that as you'll
remember from the last time we actually
have to state this problem as a decision
problem so here's our next quiz for you
how can dave state his problem of
shortest tour as a decision problem
given a graph with distances what is the
shortest tour that visits all all
vertices of course the second option
would be given a graph with distances
and a number D is there a tour of length
at most D given a graph of distances how
long is the shortest tour so please
check the problem statement that states
shortest tour as a decision problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
