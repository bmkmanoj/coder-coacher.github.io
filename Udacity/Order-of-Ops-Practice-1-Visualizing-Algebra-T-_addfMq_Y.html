of operations problem but if you got the
answer of negative 88 great job the
first thing that we want to do when we
look at an order of operation problem is
to do the innermost parentheses first I
can see right here there is the
innermost parentheses of 6-6 squared so
the first thing I'm going to do is
calculate 6-6 squared 6 squared is 36 so
I have 6 minus 36 and of course 6-36
gives me a negative 30 it's important
when doing these order of operation
problems that you write down all of the
operations that you have not yet
performed so I'm going to copy down the
rest of the problem so for this first
step I simply evaluated what was in the
innermost parentheses which 6-36 is
negative 30 now I'm working in the
brackets and I know that I have to do my
powers or my exponents first so negative
5 squared is negative twenty five and
six squared is 36 now that I've
evaluated all my exponents or powers the
next thing I want to do is my
multiplication when I do my
multiplication it's a good idea to work
from the left to the right I'm still
working in these brackets so the two
multiplications that I have to do our
negative 25 times negative 2 which gives
me positive 50 i leave the minus 36 and
the other multiplication that I have to
do is negative 1 times negative 30 which
gives me positive 30 now that I have
finished all the exponents
multiplication and division within my
brackets now I can do my addition in my
subtraction 50 minus 36 is 14 and then I
can add the 14 and the 30 14 plus 30
gives me 44 the last thing I need to do
is this last operation which is
multiplication negative two x 44 gives
me negative 88</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
