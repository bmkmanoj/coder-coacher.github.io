well there we go now the next command
that I want to show you is print object
and print object displays a description
of an object that you specify and the
output that you'll get is similar to
what would happen if you use the
expression command and then use println
like we just saw now the abbreviation
for print object can all be done with
pio instead of just like P space so it's
all P o and we'll run this for the bugs
array and we can see that it is empty
again
now let's try running P o for self and
this time ll DB does its best to give us
a description just like we saw earlier
when we were implementing printable and
debug printable but because those things
are not implemented this is the best it
can do so it gives us the type
breakpoint bug view controller and the
address now if we were to implement
printable and debug printable like we
saw earlier then when we use the PIO
command ll DB will choose the most
specific protocol and show that
description so debug printable is
considered more specific than printable
so if debug printable was implemented it
would show it if printable is the only
thing implemented then Pio would just
display the printable description so
we'll show that as an example real quick
I'll stop and we'll go to the bottom of
this file and let's implement these
protocols in an extension
and now that we've implemented both the
printable and debug printable protocols
let's try printing out self again
and we see that because debug
description is the more specific debug
printable is the more specific protocol
that's what's used so hello from debug
printable and I'll stop and let's
comment this out only implement
printable let's bring back up the same
situation now if we Pio self we get
hello from printable so that was pretty
cool but now I really want to show off
the flexibility of the command-line
interface and this next example is going
to be a little advanced so don't worry
if you don't follow everything the first
time I show it to you we're gonna use it
again an example later in the lesson so
to start what I've done is I kind of set
us up again we're in the add bug to view
and we have a breakpoint set that we've
reached and I've already allowed it to
run so that all these bugs were created
and then I've triggered it again by
tapping when the breakpoint was active
and the reason I did that is because I
wanted to be able to print out the bugs
object and you can see all of these
image views here and we're gonna use one
of these raw addresses so I'm gonna copy
this for later use and let's go ahead
and clear this out make sure it's copy
okay there we go so we're gonna start
with the expression command but this
time we're gonna use Swift's unsafe bit
cast function and the unsafe bit cast
function it's gonna allow us to convert
the raw address into an object that we
can actually interact with and this
might be really useful in cases where
you have the name re address for an
object but you're unable to access its
properties and value so let's see can
actually look at bugs there's one of
them and yeah we can interact with some
of it but let's imagine that we couldn't
in our cases where this will be handy so
here's how it can be used the first
argument is going to be our raw address
and this is the raw dress that we saw
earlier for one of our bugs and the bugs
array and we know that this address
refers to a uiimageview
because that's what is contained in the
arrey and so for the first argument we
have the raw address and then in the
second argument we have the uiimageview
dot itself which is going to allow us to
cast the address into a uiimageview
object and we'll hit enter so boom there
we go
ello DB has just converted our raw
address into a uiimageview object and
it's even stored in it into a temporary
variable called dollar sign r4
now if we wanted to instead use our own
variable name instead of the dollar sign
r4 or whatever it ends up assigning it
we can instead we run the same
expression and we'll use let dollar sign
bug one you need to use the dollar sign
that's special for the console and the
debugger here enter and now if we run
the expression println with our variable
there we go so notice here the print
output is the exact same output that we
would get if we print out bugs where we
scroll up to the top a lot of bugs here
here we go so for the first one I think
it stops right there there's our first
uiimageview and this matches exactly the
uiimageview here that's now contained in
the variable bug 1 and I can even change
bug ones values so we'll run another
expression
so we'll say bug 1 dot frame equals cg
rekt and let's put this guy back out and
there we can see that the frame has now
been updated to have x and y of 0 and a
width and height of 64 and because we
know that bug 1 refers to the same thing
as the first bug in the array we are to
print out the bugs array we should see
the same thing and there we go so the
frame for the first bug 0 0 64 64 now
again don't worry if this example is
kind of hard to follow at first we're
going to demonstrate using this again
later in the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
