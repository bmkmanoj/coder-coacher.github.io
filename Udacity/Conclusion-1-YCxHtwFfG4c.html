course well the course videos anyway now
if you remember nothing else here's what
I would say is the biggest idea of this
class when it comes to algorithm and
data structure design there is life
after RAM in this course you lived three
such lives in the form of P Rams
distributed memory machines and
two-level memories and of course you'll
need in the afterlife hybrid models that
mix and match any of these the main
point is that there are ways to
formalize and reason about communication
which you now know so good work you as
for what comes next remember that this
class was mostly about algorithmic and
data structure of foundations meaning
theory but there's a whole other side to
hpc which is about how do you make these
ideas actually work on real machines the
many projects give you a little bit of a
flavor of this but there's a lot more to
it it's an especially complex topic and
one which I've waste not wasted which
I've spent think positive think positive
the bulk of my career thinking about so
who knows maybe you'll join me in
another course where we can spend some
time together thinking about that that
sound like a pick-up line oops awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
