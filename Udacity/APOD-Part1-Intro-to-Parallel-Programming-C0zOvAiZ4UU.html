entire books entire courses on how to go
about analyzing and optimizing code the
real point is simply that you should
have a systematic optimization process
so I'm going to introduce one systematic
optimization process called a pod a pod
stands for analyzed parallelized
optimized and deploy and the real point
of this process is that it's a cycle
there's nothing really new here this is
just good software engineering
discipline but the point is that we want
to break down the process of
optimization into several steps and to
remember not to short-circuit the really
important one which is to actually
deploy the optimizations that you've
made into the real world get some
feedback see see how they're performing
on real board data sets it's too easy to
spend all your time circling around
these two steps and optimize in a vacuum
forgetting that you know actually you
might be able to get a bigger speed-up
by doing a better job of thinking about
what you're trying to accomplish or by
going out and taking a partial
optimization into the real world and
seeing how it performs you know getting
guidance from that so this is really
nothing more than good software
engineering discipline let's take these
steps one at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
