is find these two double quotes so we
know that we want to start looking from
start link
we can't start from the beginning of
page so we want to use find on page
passing in the double quote which is
what we're looking for starting from the
start link position so here's how we
need to do that we're going to
initialize the variable start quote
which is where that double quote that
starts the URL is and what we want to do
is use page find to find in page the
string that we want to find is that
double quote to make a double quote as a
string we need to as a single quote
followed by a double quote followed by a
single quote we also need to pass in a
second parameter we don't want to find
the first double quote in the page
because that might not be part of a link
bag so we also need to pass in the
variable start link so that makes finds
start from the position of start link
look for the double quote and it will
return the location where that start
quote appears we also need to find the
end quote we'll call that in quote to
find the end quote we don't want to
start from the start link if we started
looking from the start link we'd find
the start quote again to find the end
quote we need to look starting from
after the start quote so we're gonna use
page not find again again looking for a
double quote so passing in the double
quote as the string we're searching for
we need to start from the position of
start quote we can't start from just the
position of start quote if we started
from start quote we'd find just the
start quote itself we need to start one
after that position so we need to add
one to start quote and if we start
looking from there we'll find the first
quote after that that's the quote that
ends the string so the final thing we
want to do is set the variable URL so
we'll initialize URL to the string that
we find between the start quote and the
end quote
and so we can do that using the string
selection we're selecting from the
string page we have to think carefully
about where we start we don't want to
start with the start quote because that
would include the double quote in the
URL we just want the URL not including
the double quotes so we're going to
start from the start quote plus one and
we want to go from there
until the end quote we don't want to
include the closing double quote we
don't include that one in the string so
we don't need to subtract one from the
end quote and that will get us the URL
extracted from the first link on the
webpage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
