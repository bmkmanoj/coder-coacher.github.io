descriptions of eleven behavioral
patterns which I'll briefly survey here
and then we'll have an example of one
first off is the chain of responsibility
pattern which allows you to separate a
request from the mechanism by which the
request is handled and also allows for
you to have multiple handlers for a
given request second is the command
pattern which takes what sounds like a
verb and converts it into a noun that is
you can have objects that represent
commands third is the interpreter
pattern which is quite complex because
it provides a mechanism essentially to
have an interpreter for a language you
can represent the grammar and interpret
its instances based upon whatever
operations are expressed in the language
next is the iterator or enumeration
pattern of course now languages like
Java and C++ have iterators and
enumerations but at the time the book
was written they weren't part of the
language and hence they were described
there you might think of the occurrence
of that pattern in the book as a
motivation by which the eventual feature
was added to the other programming
languages the mediator pattern is a
powerful way of encapsulating object
interactions into an object the memento
pattern captures an object's internal
state for later restore think here about
undo and redo you want to capture the
the state so you can go back to it if
you do and undo next is the observer
pattern sometimes called the listener
pattern which is a way by which classes
can notify dependent classes when an
object changes the state pattern is an
interesting one and which we've alluded
to before and you could use in
situations where you might like to
change the class of a particular object
example I think we did before had to do
with library books in which they went
from being one week books to two week
books to four week books of course in
most object-oriented you can't change
the class of an object state pattern is
a way of doing that the next pair of
classes are often useful for
representing algorithms the strategy
pattern is a family of algorithms
through the same purpose and interface
an instance of the pattern is a specific
algorithm related to that is the
template method pattern which is a
skeleton of an algorithm with hooks for
the specific step finally the visitor
pattern
is a way of applying a method to
elements in a structure and we're going
to use this as an example of a
behavioral pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
