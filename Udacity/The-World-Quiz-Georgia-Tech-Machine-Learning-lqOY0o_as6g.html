purposes of this discussion it is the
world okay so imagine the entire
universe is well described by this
picture over here okay now this is
called a grid world which is something
that people in reinforcement learning
love to think about because it's a nice
approximation for all the complexity of
the entire universe now this particular
world is a three by four grid so you
have you know 1 comma 1 2 comma 1 3
comma 1 4 comma 1
you have 1 comma 2 1 comma 3 and so on
and so forth for the purposes of this
discussion we can think of the world as
being a kind of game where you start out
in a state what you're gonna call the
start state and you're able to execute
actions one of these for up down left or
right and the purpose is to wander
around this world in such a way that
eventually you make it to this goal over
here this little green spot you see that
Michael yep and under all circumstances
you must avoid the red spot exactly now
for this particular example up does what
you think it does down does what you
think it does as do left and right but
if you find yourself at a boundaries
such as right up here in this upper
left-hand corner and you try to go up
you just stay where you are if you try
to go left you just stay where you are
but if you go right you do actually end
up in the next square got it I think so
ok three last things one this little
black space here is a place you can't
enter into so it acts just like a wall
this green space is the goal and once
you're there it's over the world is over
and you get to start over again and once
you enter into the red spot the world is
also over and you have to start over
again so you can't go through the red
square to get to the green square ok you
got it yeah excellent so here's the quiz
given this particular world with the
physics I just described to you and
given these actions that you can take up
down left and right what is the shortest
sequence of actions that would get us
from the start state to the goal State
and you can just type in the words up
down left and right separated by spaces
or commas or anything like that ok say
semicolons are allowed colons or not
yeah good that's bad you made that
distinct
well it's an important one to make okay
you got it yeah I think so
all right cool so let's see what you get
then go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
