turning on coding genes the right time
and the right place are called promoters
a promoter simply a region of non-coding
DNA that initiates transcription of a
particular gene now it's really
important for you to realize that this
is new to you is that this is not a
start codon this is not the same thing
as a start codon remember that a start
codon is important for translation of an
mRNA sequence into amino acids the
promoter is indicating the initiation of
transcription which is very different
right it's the first step in the central
dogma take a look here at this
hypothetical gene sequence we have five
exons and purple and four introns in
between these five exons this arrow
right here indicates the initiating
point for transcription the plus one
says hey this is the first nucleotide
that's transcribed here in this process
and going from the gene to the mRNA copy
and transcription is going to start here
this plus one site and go all the way to
this line here where it stops the
introns will be spliced out and we'll
get an mRNA copy of just the exons what
I want you to tell me is which region
you think is most likely to be the
promoter region this region here in
front of the gene before transcription
begins this region here in the middle of
the gene where we see it spans 1x on and
intron and another X on or do you think
it's this region over here after
transcription is already terminated for
the gene go ahead and pick which region
you think is most likely the promoter
and then I want you to tell me why by
