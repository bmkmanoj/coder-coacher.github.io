in network protocols it helps to have a
bit of a visual language just as we
might use a line graph to depict a
financial trend or a histogram to show
the distribution of a variable there's a
particular kind of chart that's useful
for illustrating Network protocols it's
called a sequence diagram and here's an
example this is a diagram of an HTTP
connection using keepalive these two
lines on the left and right are time
lines with time advancing from the top
to the bottom the line on the Left
represents the clients view of the world
the line on the right is the server's
view of the world and these arrows
between them represent messages sent
from the client to the server or from
the server to the client you'll
sometimes see them drawn at an angle
which serves to remind you that messages
are never instantaneous there's always
latency or lag time between when the
client sends something and the server
receives it or vice-versa
but conventionally they're drawn
straight and we just have to remember
that time never goes backwards now
because we haven't invented time travel
anything that either end does any point
in time can only be affected by things
that that end has already seen like if
the client sends two requests and the
server starts responding to the first
one as soon as it sees it the server
can't change its first response on the
basis of the second request it hasn't
seen that second one yet
sequence diagrams remind us to keep
things in order and to make sure that
our notions of what's going on in the
network don't assume that server's can
see the future so here's what's going on
in this diagram the client sends an HTTP
GET request with a connection keepalive
header the server sends a response and
once the client has received that
response it can send another request
over the same connection and so on
here's the thing though a sequence
diagram always represents some
particular level of a protocol like
here's a diagram for just one request at
the HTTP layer with a HTTP GET and a
response but this doesn't show
individual IP packets and i assure you
that if that response is a download of a
six megabyte file it's not going to
happen as simply as just one arrow
suggests
when we look deeper into the stack we'll
find that one exchanged on the HTTP
level may be a shorthand for a bunch of
exchanges on a lower level in fact let's
take a closer look at that right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
