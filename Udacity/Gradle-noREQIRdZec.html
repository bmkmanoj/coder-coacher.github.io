going to be using Android studio to load
up a project that's only partially about
Android but it'll make a ton more sense
once we talk about the Gradle build
system so how does a game turn from
source code in your editor into a form
you can run well there's actually way
more code in a lib GDX game than just
the code you're going to write there's
all the middleware that defines the
libgdx ap is and then there's all the
code for whatever back-end you're
building to compile your game all the
relevant code will need to be collected
compiled and linked not only that but
your game will likely feature resources
like images and sounds which will need
to be processed and packaged building an
Android project is even more complicated
as it needs to know about all of your
resources before any of the Java gets
compiled this is starting to sound like
a nightmare right well thankfully the
Gradle build system knows how to handle
pretty much all of this a Gradle project
is described in one or more build.gradle
files which define what sort of project
is being built where the code lives and
what external libraries are being used
and finally how to package the output
Gradle also exposes a list of tasks that
define what Gradle knows how to do with
the source files and the resources it
has full disclosure the course I made
before this one was all about Gradle and
how it makes Android builds awesome so
what does this have to do with Android
studio well Gradle is very tightly
integrated into android studio in fact
Android studio will happily import and
build any project that uses Gradle
android studio maintains its own
internal model of what your project
looks like which is how it does cool
stuff like auto importing and code
completion this also means that when an
imports of Gradle project or when one of
the DA cradle files changes Android
studio has to synchronize its internal
model of the project with the model of
the project as defined by Gradle so if
you ever see Android studio complaining
about having to sync with Gradle that's
what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
