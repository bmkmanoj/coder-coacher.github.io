method of the word which is a string so
string dot is upper method to check if
it is in fact an uppercase word if it is
then I enumerate all the letters in the
word I reverse it so this slice says
reverse it
the missing numbers on either side of
the colon says take the whole word and
the minus one says go from the back
forward so reverse the word enumerate it
give me pairs of indexes from 0 to n
along with the individual digits and
then I'm going to just say 10 to the 8th
power and the digit and that gives us 1
times u Plus 10 times o plus 100 times
the Y and it works out backwards from
the from the normal while you order but
that doesn't matter I take those results
I put a plus sign in between them and I
wrapper n thesese around them and if
it's not upper I just returned the word
itself now explained the whole program
I'm calling it faster solve and I take a
formula the first thing I do is compile
the formula that gives me back the
function that represents it and I'm also
a while I'm there I'm also returning the
letters that are within the formula that
evaluation or compilation of the formula
is done once then I go through all the
permutations of the digits taken lengths
of letters at a time and notice that I'm
using actual integers here not strings
for the individual digits if applying
the function to the digits is true then
I did the same thing that I did before
of making up a translation table and
calling the formula translate to get my
final result but not only have to do
this translation once on the specific
permutation that I know works I don't
have to do it every time like I did in
the previous version of salt and then if
there's an arithmetic error I catch that
and go on to the next permutation now
the function compile formula takes a
formula as input first I figure out all
the letters so that's going to be the Y
a me you and O then
and I figure out that the list of
parameters I want to put into my
functions got to be a string consisting
of the letters with a comma in between
them I figure out all the tokens so a
token is an individual term like the U
or the equal signs or the me and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
