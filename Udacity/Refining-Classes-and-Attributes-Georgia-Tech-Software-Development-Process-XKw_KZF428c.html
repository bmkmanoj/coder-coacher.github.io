so let me ask you something about what
we've done so far I also sent in in what
I sent you I also had some stories about
how the actual library is used you asked
me to do that and we're going to take
use that here I'm glad you asked
actually yeah those are you know will we
call use cases what we will use as
scenarios kind of things that we will
use to derive use cases and they're also
a very good way of extracting
requirements we're not going to look at
them right now because now we're more
working on kind of the static structure
of the system but after we're done with
the class diagram that we know we'll do
it at a different time but we're gonna
use those two to see how the library is
actually used and see whether we can get
more information that we can use to
refine our requirements based on that
okay okay so for now we'll just focus in
on the on the structure but those you
know I'm glad you sent them because they
were gonna be they're gonna be very
useful as well okay so let's see well
first of all I'm it seems like this is
already pretty crowded right we have a
number of classes so let's see if
there's like some class and maybe
superfluous and or we can model in a
different way so for example you know
what well thinking of this I was
thinking that the library card and it
doesn't really contain much information
right so is it basically just a number
the the card has a number on it we have
a separate vendor that does that for us
so we don't need it doesn't need to be
part of this system we just have to make
sure that every patron has a library
okay so basically for you in a sense the
library card is just an ID that gets
associated that's that's right from
right that's right so I think that the
best way to represent this I mean unless
you need an entity because you're
creating it yourself but it seems like
you're not I will just remove this one
and I would like to put this so
basically to take the library card
number and add it to the bathroom okay
make sense
okay so I'll edit here and as an
additional attribute okay and we'll
eliminate this class okay okay oh and
wait a second so I guess also the child
needs a library card number
child leans needs a library card number
but let me let me ask you about that
okay is is child a separate class or is
it is it just another kind of patron oh
I see I see because yeah it's sort of a
special patron right and so maybe we
should even we should represent it as a
kind of a refinement of the patron hmm
but that maybe made me think so what is
the only thing that characterizes
children is just the age well and if
they're that they can't check out more
than five books okay and the only
difference is the fact that they are
they're less you know then twelve year
old cover less write a lot less so I
guess you know I would probably like to
represent this by making the age
explicit in the patron rather than then
represented it as a class and I'll tell
you why because one of the issues and
then you know then that might happen
again
is that basically there are patterns
that are children and there are no
longer children when they become you
know thirteen or all the right right and
if we represent them with a separate
class in a sense then we cannot really
change the type of the other of an
instance of these classes so we'll have
to kind of destroy the patron creating
new ones so that means he wants have to
transfer any history we want to keep
history and so on so I I think I kind of
like better the idea that I'm I won't
represent the age explicit in the patron
and then I'll behave differently based
on whether the patron is twelve year old
or younger or thirteen thirteen year
older or older that's it do you see any
problem with that it makes things a
little simpler okay and we actually the
lives are also 20-minute one one class
here so I'm gonna proceed this way so
I'm gonna eliminate the children class
and I'm gonna put the age in the patron
okay and let me see so in this spirit
actually something else that jumps at me
is this idea of the bestseller because I
kind of feel like we might have the same
problem so what's a what's the story
well what is the bestseller well it's
it's it's a an item that we want to
restrict how long people can keep keep
because there's such demand for it I say
and so basically a book that is a
best-seller
like the New York Times bestseller is a
best-seller forever no no no it's hot
for a while and then it becomes just a
regular item oh I see then I guess it's
a similar situation to the one I was
mentioning before okay that if we have a
book it will have to kind of change its
type if it becomes a best-seller then we
have to change this type again if it's
no longer a best-seller right so it
seems to me the better way to represent
this is just to eliminate this
bestseller class and instead I'm gonna
put the bestseller attribute which will
be just a boolean in the book okay what
do you mean by boolean right we don't
know what the boolean is right the
bullion is basically just the number I
can have two values like true or false
okay so we'll usually normally use it in
this in these cases every imagine one
zero right and which is kind of the
basic you know the bits right okay so
this is just telling a Sukkah flag that
is telling us this book is a best-seller
or not okay and it's very easy to change
this value and make a book a best-seller
or not a best-seller than just creating
and destroying you know instances of
these classes okay makes sense okay so
at this point this looks already better
right because we have a less classes and
I think we did we did here we did some
serious cleanup that's good okay so now
that we eliminate this and what they
said what I like to do as I said we're
going to both clean up and but also
refine and I like to go back to our
requirements and see whether we can
identify additional attributes for this
class so that maybe are not as obvious
as the one that we saw so far okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
