adaptive design namely the points at
which are you I breaks let's talk about
the what of adaptive design specifically
the techniques for what to fix let's
think back to what we wanted to optimize
our eyes for and what we can do filling
the width of the screen can become
problematic on wider devices this might
not optimized for balance and line
length there are a couple of approaches
we can take to address this firstly you
can show additional content on the
screen instead of just filling the extra
space we can instead show more content
there one way to do this is to reveal
previously hidden UI elements for
example you might use an off screen
navigation drawer on small devices but
then pin it on the screen on larger
devices we might also divide the
available space to show additional
content for example showing a details
page on the same screen as a list rather
than on a completely new screen we also
might reflow content on different sized
screens to better arrange it in this
example we re flowing a few things on
the larger screen firstly we switch from
a single column of content to multiple
columns to make better use of the
available space secondly we're not just
rearranging these content cards we're
also adjusting their layouts to better
fit with this new arrangement lastly we
tweak the app bar height when the space
is available for more balanced branded
appearance we can also use this reflow
technique in different orientations on
the same device in this example a
portrait layout places an image with a
set aspect ratio above some text now
using the same layout in landscape would
likely fill the entire screen with an
image and push the text down below the
fold a better approach would be to
reflow the content so that it's
horizontally stacked instead of
vertically allowing you to see both the
image and the text together notice that
we're also reflowing the fab to a more
appropriate position for this layout if
you don't have more content to show on
screen then you can expand the content
up to a point and then introduce margins
to constrain it from growing too wide
this works extremely well with the paper
metaphor where you can use a paper
surface which has a maximum width to
constrain the content this technique can
also work great if you have rich imagery
such as a full bleed background which
you can put behind the content and layer
a surface on top of it this can create
an extremely immersive experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
