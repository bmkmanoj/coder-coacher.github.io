the way everybody know what pixel stands
for pixel stands for a picture element
if you talked to a television engineer
30 years ago 40 years ago he talked
about pels computer people call them
pixels television people call them pels
a little bit information so we know that
we have pixels at every sort of location
X Y and image it has some will just use
the word color for now so let's zoom in
on a little area here and we take a look
at some particular pixel and we can say
that pixel is at X location here it says
243 why location of 84 and what's the
value in that pixel well that value
actually was three of them right here
they are a red a 150 173 and 81 written
as r g and b values those are the values
the intensities of each of the three
channels red green and blue alright so
the color here are vectors remember we
talked about them as being a vector
image right so at every location we get
a different vector by the way you see
over here on this white pixel says 250 4
255 251 this is obviously an 8-bit image
that goes from 0 to 255 if this was a
floating point number that we let go
from 0 to 1 at floating-point image then
that would be you know point nine eight
point nine nine nine or one point 0 and
point nine seven or something like that
alright so those three values together
give you the perceived color when you're
displaying an image what you're really
doing is you're plotting at different
locations on the screen a vector by
essentially turning on a red light or
green light in a blur you're essentially
doing a plot of those colors but when
you look at it it looks like a picture
all right what would happen if instead
of plotting them in XY you plotted them
in RGB space ok so you can make them be
the same color as before but you're
going to put them down in a
three-dimensional space not according to
X Y but according what they're r g and b
value is well so here i have that same
little picture and i pull out the first
pixel and you can see here that red is
152 green 50 blue 40 so that's what's
down here and this is in this
three-dimensional space all right
here's another point closer to white so
it's all the way up in the corner and
finally here's a third point alright so
these are plotting these pixels in the
RGB space so we go from image space to
color space so let's take those fruit
pixels and plot them all in RGB space
what would that look like well it would
look like this and this is sort of a
kind of an elegant three-dimensional
plot of that and what you can notice
right away is that the pixels are sort
of grouped right these kind of reddish
pixels presumably have something to do
with the apples you know what are these
whitish pixels well they're going to be
the background and here these yellow as
pixels probably do with the oranges and
you start to think about you know we
might be able to use your location in
color space to try to segment out the
different parts of the image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
