lexing or breaking up into words HTML
let's turn our attention to javascript
the other language will be considering
in this class and I'm going to introduce
you to JavaScript by jumping right into
an example by way of a parable over here
on the Left we see some web page code
apparently a web page owned by Steven
welcome to Stevens web page and Steven
would really like to compute five
factorial 5 times 4 times 3 times 2
times 1 over here on the Left we see the
HTML source code and on the right we see
the result as it would render this P tag
I haven't introduced you to yet but it
means begin a new paragraph will write
out the words welcome to will show
Steven in bold you've got this 5
factorial this bang the the ! often
means factorial in mathematics printed
in italic so you can see it slanted but
unfortunately steven is super sad he
can't remember the value of 5 factorial
well this is exactly the sort of thing
that a programming language like Java
Script could help us out with it can
carry out computations just like Python
so we can do work in the middle of a web
page let's write our first java script
script together here this line starting
with script type equals text javascript
and then this document right line and
then ending here with this closing
script tag all of this these three lines
together are a JavaScript program
embedded inside an HTML webpage
JavaScript programs always begin with
this special script tag and this tag has
an argument because there might be
multiple types of tags out there in the
universe we've seen tag arguments before
with the anchor tag here I have an
anchor tag where the argument is a
hypertext reference here I have a script
where we're telling the web browser you
should treat this as a JavaScript
program so this JavaScript program is
very simple the equivalent of print
hello world in Python Java scripts name
for the print function is doc
right which will sometimes just
abbreviate is right but the semantics
the meaning are largely the same it's
also worth noting that we've put
parentheses around the argument to
document dot write almost as if it were
a mathematical function we can do that
in Python it's allowed but often we
don't and we've ended the line with a
semicolon whereas at the end of a Python
line we often don't have a semicolon but
again you can put semicolons at the end
of Python lines you just typically don't
so now we're going to try to use the
full phenomenal cosmic power of
JavaScript to compute five factorial to
do so I'm going to make a recursive
function called surprise surprise
factorial it's going to compute the
value so let's walk through every part
of this JavaScript code together the
word function means I'm declaring a
function this is very similar to def in
Python then I give the name of the
function and then I write the arguments
just like I would in Python in Python
I'd have a colon here but javascript
require a slightly different punctuation
this opening curly brace and in this
regard it's more like languages such as
C or C++ or Java or C sharp curly brace
languages our factorial function is
going to be recursive and every
recursive function needs a base case a
time when it stops our stopping
condition is when n is 0 we could have
picked and is less than or equal to 0
and is less than or equal to 1 so i have
an if statement that's checking that
again in Python this would probably look
very very similar except that we'd use a
colon instead of an opening curly brace
if n is 0 we return 1 and I have a
semicolon at the end of all my
statements then in Python I would know
that i'm done with the if statement
because of the tabbing javascript
doesn't use that sort of readable
tabbing rule to figure out the control
flow when an if statement ends so
instead you have to explicitly close off
this opening curly brace just like you'd
have to close off a tag in HTML or
closed off parenthesis once you start
them we're going to study this a lot
more as
goes by so I closed off the then branch
of life I have a semicolon and now I
have a new return statement and this is
basically just a formula for factorial
it's n times the factorial of n minus 1
so this part here is a function call in
fact a recursive function call just like
you'd expect to see in Python I'm ending
the whole thing with the semicolon this
is the end of my function definition and
at the end of the day I print out and
the JavaScript version of print is
document dot write factorial of 5 and
over here on the right you can actually
see it we've got the 120 which is the
correct value for factorial so what that
tells me is that if prettiness matters I
should delete those question marks
because now we are super happy because
we can compute 5 factorial using
embedded JavaScript in the middle of a
web page or to put it another way a way
that's a bit more puntastic it's a good
thing javascript can run on the page of
stephen and basically my voice is
telling me not to quit my day job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
