Swift and seventy percent jective see so
we had a lot of objective-c code that
was interrupted into Swift with through
Swift headers and a lot of the time
because of it implicitly unwrapped
optionals we would expect some variables
to be non nil but because for some
reason or summer edge case we had an ill
parameter passed through that would
cause lots of bugs and I think we've had
thousands and thousands of crashes in
our current app because of that interop
is shoe in general and that's actually
one of the reasons we decided that like
going one hundred percent swift is
important for re for both like our
developer happiness because this is much
nicer codebase to work with but also for
the happiness of our users who will be
able to use a more robust product so the
most common interrupt ability challenge
I've encountered when is what I'm going
from Swift to objective-c so my jetta c
code is consuming my swift code and the
challenge i face is that all the time I
swift code it includes struck sandy
gnomes and other constructs that are
specific to Swift only so it's very
difficult or actually Xcode doesn't make
it possible at all to like create
headers for those in adjectives see and
in order to like have your deck to see
code consume that swift code you have to
create like wrapper classes that kind of
shimmy your code from Swift Objective C
which leads to like more lines of code
more files of code and more complexity
which was probably one of the larger
reasons as to why we decided to do a
rewrite where we don't run into issues
like this after we complete our null
ability on it it wasn't like completely
smooth sailing because we realize that
like our null ability audit actually
exposed some bad practices that we were
doing in our objective c code base
because sometimes things that shouldn't
be male ever we were setting to know
like just not realizing that we were and
but thankfully with apples like toolkit
they've given us with the data sea and
when they introduced node is no ability
audit so the ability to do them they
give you warnings every time you do
settling vanilla that's not supposed to
be no
and that was helpful and I was like
improving the quality rare codebase
making it more robust by removing those
warnings by making sure we'd never set
those values to know or if we are if we
they should be nil by making sure that
like we don't we make them nullable
they're actually no features are
especially difficult to port from
objective-c to Swift and that's because
porting anything from the deputy to
Swift is relatively straightforward
because objective-c when you've been
from the objective-c to Swift like all
the constructs that exists an injector
see also existence lift so you can
literally just go from a sink tactical
change from ejecting the Swift the point
of our rewrite though was not to port
the code like one to one it was to make
architectural decisions that led to a
more robust code base and that meant a
lot of white boarding there were
multiple correct solutions but probably
one best solution so meant a lot of like
like this meeting as a team and figuring
out like what that best solution was and
that's like where I think our brains
like kind of like worked the most and it
was engaging but also like a difficult
problem solve so for the most part if I
was writing a new app I would write it
one hundred percent in Swift because
almost all the features that exist in
objective-c also exist in Swift that
said if I wanted to do something crazy
like methods was linked I think because
ejecta see is a dynamic language I would
do it in the jet to see that said I
don't think I'd ever be doing methods
whistling if I'm doing something the
right way so I would probably go 100
Swift and maybe use some objective c
dependencies if they make my life easier
but right my main product in Swift
because it gives you all the powers of
map and flat map in generic sense trucks
and value types which is very powerful
that objective c just doesn't give you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
