fundamental computer vision method of
doing active sensing is what's referred
to as structured light so here's the
stereo figure that you might remember
that we used before the idea was we had
two cameras right and there was some
point out here and that point would
project whoops missed the line there
okay that's better
it would project to this point here it
would project to that point there and
because I knew which two points they
were I could figure out the
triangulation all right well structured
light says instead of having a camera
over here I'm gonna put a projector and
what this projector is going to do is
instead of having a sensor here that
notice is where a point is and remember
we had to go look for the point what
we're gonna do is we're gonna send the
things out this way all right so we're
gonna send some particular think of just
one point for a minute right and then in
this camera over here we're gonna see
where does that point show up on the
image plane and then we can do the
triangulation but instead of doing
points what we actually do is we project
stripes of some sort in fact sometimes
this is called light striping right and
here it's shown with colors that makes
it real easy and the system of course
knows where each of the colors lies on
its plane so then in the right image in
the right camera the only camera we see
a picture that looks like this so what
you can see here is like when these
things are bent like this okay as it
comes closer to you all right so it
comes over here it moves to the left and
so the line moves to the left there in
fact you can see that a little more
clearly in this image here all right so
we have set of hands and these are the
light stripes that are projected on them
and actually this is observed in just
the right hand camera and here what
you're seeing is a 3d reconstruction of
this surface based upon that light
stripe so basically by doing this light
striping by projecting these stripes out
and then seeing them over here I can
recover a full 3d model all right so
that's one form of projecting something
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
