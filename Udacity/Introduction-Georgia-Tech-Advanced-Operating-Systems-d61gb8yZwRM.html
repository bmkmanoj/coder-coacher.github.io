level from the point of view of
administering the engine that powers
Internet scale computing how do we
program services such as web search and
airline reservation on top of the data
center cluster resources how do they
exploit the hardware parallelism that's
available in these clusters we will
learn about the MapReduce programming
paradigm that answers these questions
the term big data has become a buzzword
computations in giant scale services are
usually simple but they work over large
data sets and hence the name big data
and naturally because they are working
with a large data set these computations
take a long time to compute for example
let's say that I want to search for john
f kennedy's photographs in all the
documents that are available on the web
it's going to take a long time and that
is an example of a big data computation
similar examples include online
reservations shopping etc and
applications that work on big data would
like to exploit the parallelism that's
available in the cluster at the data
centers I mentioned in the last lesson
that data centers these days comprised
of computational elements on the order
of thousands and even 10,000 nodes that
are ready to do computations and we
would like to exploit the computational
resources available in such big data
centers to do computations on big data
for example if it is john f kennedy's
photographs i'm looking in all the
different documents we can paralyze the
search for a kennedy's photo in all the
documents in parallel on all the
available nodes in the data center and
such computations are also called
embarrassingly parallel computations
what does this mean well there is not
much synchronization or coordination
that is needed among the parallel threat
that comprise the applications and that
run on different nodes of the
computational cluster looking for John f
kennedy's photographs in all the
documents on the web is a good example
of such an embarrassingly parallel
application what are all the issues in
programming in the large on large data
sets so the data sets are also large and
the computational resources on which we
want to run this big data application is
also vast so some of the interesting
issues in programming in the large
include how to paralyze an application
across let's say 10,000 machines how to
handle the data distribution and
plumbing between the producers of data
and consumers of data remember these are
embarrassingly parallel applications but
different phases of the application will
require data from one phase of the
application to be passed on to the next
phase of the application that's what we
mean by plumbing between the producers
of data intermediate data to be more
specific and consumers of that
intermediate data and of course one of
the biggest challenges in big data
applications on large computational
clusters is failure handling recall what
we said about the nature of these data
centers they employ thousands and
thousands of processes when you have so
many parts in any setting failure is not
a question of if it will happen it is a
question of when it is going to happen
so that's a fact of life and therefore
programming models for big data have to
worry about the fact that failures are
to be expected in this environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
