number of tickets we drag a summarized
tool onto the canvas we can use one
formula to calculate the average and
also exclude any missing values at the
same time and that is the AVG no zero
function we click on the average number
of tickets filled in the configuration
panel select the add drop-down and then
select the AVG no zero function next we
add an append fields tool onto the
canvas so we can add the new field we
calculated to every row of data then we
connect in all the data and select allow
all the pens at the bottom now that the
mean of the average number of tickets
has been appended to every record in the
data set we can now replace the records
where there is a null value in the
average number of tickets with this new
calculated field to do this we add a
formula tool and we're going to update
the field called average number of
tickets but we're going to build in an
expression a conditional expression that
looks where the value is null and
replaces it with that new value that was
just calculated to do this we go to
functions conditional choose the first
if-then-else condition and build out the
condition if is null so we go down to
the test functions and we're looking for
where the field average number of
tickets is null then T becomes the field
that we just calculated else we keep
original value of the average number of
tickets when we run the workflow we can
verify that our formula work properly so
let's look at the results so now there
are no longer any null values here and
you can see the value that it took was
the value of the
mean number of average number of tickets
finally we can add a scatterplot tool
and look at the output configure it the
same way it was configured before and
now we can compare the scatterplot to
the original on the Left we're looking
at the original scatterplot with all of
the data and on the right we're looking
at the scatterplot with the data plus
the imputed values so with a quick
glance we can see that using imputation
we obtain a slope of the line that is
very close to the original providing us
with a level of confidence that this
might be the right way to handle the
rows that are missing the average number
of tickets filled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
