snapshot on the RAM as a boolean formula
I'm going to show you a little trick
with a boolean formula so this boolean
formula it looks a bit intimidating and
it doesn't look fun well I'll just
quickly explain it to you and then have
you figure out the special property that
it has so the formula consists of six
variables X 1 X 2 X 3 2 X X and it has 7
brackets so as you can see each of those
brackets contains all of the six
variables X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6
sometimes they're a bit mixed up but
every bracket here contains the six
variables exactly once they're all
connected with an end here and each one
of them looks like this so up here you
have an or over all of those variables
and down here each bracket has a very
similar structure so you have X 1 or you
have one of the variables and a nought
of that variable or and this is a very
big knot over all of the other variables
and those are combined by or now
probably it's a bit tough to figure out
by yourself what the purpose of this
formula is I want you to figure it out
but I will give you a few choices so
what's special about this boolean
formula does it not have any satisfying
assignment does it have several
satisfying assignments can it only be
satisfied if exactly one of those six
variables is set to true and finally if
you generalize this
so not six variables but any number n of
variables and then you do the same
structure as you do here that's the
whole resulting formula have size o of N
squared for n variables so as I think by
now you're used to more than one of
these answers here can be true so please
check all of these that are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
