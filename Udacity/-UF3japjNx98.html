a little bit so we have three critical
regions the smallest one has a
probability greater than this z score of
0 point 0 0 1 and this z-score here is
3.08 and remember that the middle of the
distribution the mean has a z-score of 0
then our second smallest critical region
is 0 point 0 1 so that's the probability
of being greater than this value which
you found was about two point three two
and then our biggest critical region is
0 point 0 5 so that's the probability
greater than a z-score of 1.65 the
z-score is corresponding to these alpha
levels are called the Z critical values
so we'll find our sample mean calculate
the z-score in the distribution of
sample means or the sampling
distribution and then look to see where
this mean falls let's say it falls in
the critical region any of them that
means it's unlikely if it falls out here
in the green region or the smallest
critical region will report the smallest
alpha level because that means our
sample statistics are really different
from the population parameters and
therefore there's strong evidence of an
effect from whatever treatment was
imposed for example say we take some
sample mean from some sample size n and
then we calculate the z-score so
remember we subtract them you and then
divide by the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution and let's say we
get that the z-score is 1.8 2 we would
say that this is significant at p less
than 0.05 and that's because if we look
at where this z-score falls on the
distribution it falls in between one
point six five and two point three two
so this z-score 1.82 is somewhere in
this red region meaning that the
probability of having obtained this
sample mean is less than point zero five
but it's not less than point zero one so
it's only significant at probability or
p less than point zero five and remember
point zero five is the
the level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
