could happen to a startup is a large
company says hey you know I want to
invest in you and I'm really interested
in doing something with you guys we just
don't want to be a you know a supplier
or joint venture we want to put money
into your company and I get all the time
entrepreneurs right hey look so-and-so
is really interested investing our
company what a great idea
it is a great idea but you really need
to put on your you know green eyeshades
and black armbands and roll up your
sleeves and really think through here
what's in it for you
versus what's in it for them obviously
if you're a technology-driven company
the first thing they want is access to
your technology congratulations but you
know their objectives are not to make
you a large company their objectives is
to make them a larger company so you
need to understand what kind of deals do
they want all we want most favored
nations clause which means oh if you
sign a deal with anybody else we always
want a better deal or my favorite is all
we want an exclusive for a year now all
these things sound great from the large
company's perspective but the question
to ask yourself is well what do they do
for me building my business and I always
turn to large companies and turn this
around and I'd say you know you want to
win your exclusive or you want most
favorite Nations sounds like you
actually want to buy us without actually
spending the money because my goal is
not to be a small subsidiary of your
engineering department my goal is to
build a company your size and so we need
to understand what's in it for both of
us and so I tend to try to understand
first of all who's the sponsor
and what's the motivation and and it
needs to come from the business side not
just some technology people and these
you can't be dealing with junior bizdev
people ultimately because their first
answer for their first offers are always
oh when your exclusives and we need you
know all these other things and and
while that's great for them because they
have their checklist you need to be
prepared to walk away but if you
understand who the spy
answer is you can actually have an adult
conversation saying listen this doesn't
work for me actually what you want me to
do is to be selling to your competitors
because that's the only way I could grow
more resources to make you successful
I'm happy to consider how you get an
advantage but you can't decide I'm your
only supplier so one of the ways I tend
to deal with these is try to get sales
deals not investments that is to me it's
a lot better to get a $10,000,000 order
from a company than a 10 million dollar
ownership position that they take
because now that are your boss as well
or try to offer warrants that is
essentially options on buying stock
based on sales success remember while it
might feel great to have name of big
company next to yours for the first year
eventually this will be a lead weight
unless it turns into revenue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
