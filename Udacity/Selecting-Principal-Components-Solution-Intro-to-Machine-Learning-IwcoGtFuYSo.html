you if you guessed I don't blame you the
correct answer is number two that what
you want to do is be open to different
number of principal components being
relevant to you and the way that you
figure out sort of what that trend is is
just by trying different numbers you say
just give me the first principal
component the first plus the second the
first plus the second plus the third and
you watch how the accuracy response to
these increasing numbers of principal
components you can also do this in just
plain old future selection as well you
say give me all the features in the
order of their importance and I'm just
gonna try adding them one at a time and
see how the accuracy responds and cut
off when it seems like it's plateauing
one thing you don't want to do though is
performing feature selection before you
go into pca
so remember PCA is going to find a way
to combine information from potentially
many different input features together
so if you're throwing out input features
before you do PCA you're throwing out
that information that the PCA might be
able to kind of rescue in a sense it's
fine to do feature selection on the
principal components after you've made
them but you want to be very careful
about throwing out information before
you perform PCA that having been said
PCA can be fairly computationally
expensive so if you have a very large
input feature space and you know that a
lot of them are potentially completely
irrelevant features go ahead and try
tossing them out but proceed with
caution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
