or hypertext markup language HTML
documents are the the heart of the web
the web is basically made up of these
documents that can do a number of things
so hTML is made up of text content which
is what you see it's made up of markup
which is what that content looks like or
how its arranged it's made up of
references to other documents like
images and videos you may have something
that looks like this and you've got some
text and you'll have a you know an image
in your page or like the page you're
looking at now which is got a video in
the middle of it you know the page
you're looking at now is made up of HTML
and it's got references to a big fat
video and it can be made up of links to
other pages and I'm sure you're very
familiar with what links are and how
they are used
let's let's play around with the HTML a
little bit this is a simple HTML editor
we have so we can play with things and
test them out you can follow along by
either I think there should be a link in
the course notes or you can also go to
www.h
and that should get you this this little
page where you can kind of experiment a
little bit this is kind of a fake little
test browser so the first thing I'd like
to show you is that if we have just some
blank text if we were to render this as
HTML it would look the same plain text
is plain text in HTML for the most part
but if we want to make the text look
different we need to use something
called markup which is one of the other
facets of HTML and let's uh let's learn
a little bit about markup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
