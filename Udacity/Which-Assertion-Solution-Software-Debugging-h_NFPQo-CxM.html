recall our initial state diagram
initially we're in this state no quote
no tag if we see a beginning of a tag we
go into the no quote and tagged mode and
in this mode we can go into quote and
tagged mode from which we exit again
missing closing quote and when we see
the closing tag we go back into the non
quote non Tag Mode these are the three
states that a program can be in which
state is missing the state that is
missing is a state in which we would
have quotes but we are outside of tags
this is exactly the problem we would be
handling in our program we would take
care of quotes even outside of tags this
state should not be reached so how can
we express this with our a search
statement what we want to make sure is
that this state can never be reached so
this is quote and not tagged the
inversion of this is tagged or not quote
you can see that either we're in non
quote mode or if we are in quote mode
then we are in Tag Mode and their
session that actually checks this is
this one this is therefore the correct
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
