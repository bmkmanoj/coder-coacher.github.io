was porting a popular pc flight
simulator to the amiga computer this was
anxious ago there was a steep learning
curve I've been programming for maybe 10
years since junior high school by this
time but this was my first real
professional programming experience I
was learning about 93 new things every
single day and there were new tools to
understand and libraries and systems to
integrate hardware issues and interfaces
not to mention the game itself it had
been written for a completely different
computer architecture by some super
smart industry vets including one of the
company founders oh and did I mention I
didn't know anything about flight
simulators well I remember one of the
first issues i ran into it was a problem
with the 3d renderer on the pc it worked
great it was pretty much bulletproof
super fast been used in several titles
and it just kept getting better as it
was refined over time on the Amiga
though the renderer was brand new never
been used in production and there was a
glitch sometimes unpredictably a polygon
would tear and it would just blow up and
over right half the screen look terrible
and since I hadn't written the code and
had no idea how our 3d engine worked I
wasn't really sure how to debug it I
turned to one of those super smart
industry vets one of the creators of the
3d engine in fact and asked him for
advice on tracking down this bug and he
said I went you step through all the
code well from my point of view this was
insane I just didn't see how I could
possibly learn and understand how this
engine worked from top to bottom which
is essentially what he was telling me I
needed to do to step through the system
and figure out which part wasn't working
i had to know what each and every part
did when it was working he was right
though and it was hard but I learned
more than just how that 3d engine worked
I learned that I could tackle a really
hard problem and solve it you can always
look for the easy answer but it's
important that you not give up if there
isn't one you have what it takes to
succeed even if it doesn't seem like it
