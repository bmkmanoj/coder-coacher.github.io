optimizations which are about reducing
the aim and we have seen that a mat can
be reduced by reducing the hit time and
we have seen several techniques that do
this
the a mat can also be reduced by
reducing the Miss rate and we will now
look at some techniques that try to do
that so in our work on reducing the Miss
rate we really need to consider what are
the causes of misses so what can cause
misses and the causes of misses are what
we call the three C's you should
remember this because very often we will
refer to the three C's and you need to
know that the three C's are compulsory
misses capacity misses and conflict
misses a compulsory miss is a miss that
occurs when a block is accessed for the
first time
it's called compulsory because you have
to have this miss so even if we have an
infinite cache that starts out empty we
would still have the compulsory misses
but we would not have any of the other
two kinds so a compulsory miss is amiss
you have to have simply because for the
first time you have to bring a block
into the cache capacity misses are
misses that we have on blocks that were
in the cache but were evicted because we
didn't have enough room in the cache
because the cache is of a finite size so
these are misses that we would not have
in an infinite cache but capacity misses
would be misses even in a fully
associative cache of the given size so
for example if you have an 8 kilobyte
cache that is let's say direct map we
have a capacity miss if that block would
not be found in the cache even if it was
fully associative 8 kilobyte cache and
finally conflict misses occur because of
conflicts within a set so the block was
evicted not because the cache didn't
have enough space in it but because it
had limited associativity so a conflict
miss is a miss that would not be a miss
if the cache was fully associative and
of the same size so now some of the
these techniques for reducing the Miss
rate will target some of these so for
example a larger cache would help us
reduce the number of capacity misses a
larger associativity would help us
reduce the conflict misses a better
replacement policy would also help us
with conflict misses but all of those
techniques also affect the hit time so
now let's look at some techniques that
are trying to reduce the Miss rate
without necessarily increasing the hit
time in return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
