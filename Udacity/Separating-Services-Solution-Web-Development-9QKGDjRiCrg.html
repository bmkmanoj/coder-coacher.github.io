just spoke about it's nice when you have
a separate app server database cash you
know all the all those separate pieces
because different web applications have
different needs and over time you may
add features that strain the system in
different ways so having all these
separate systems means they can be
scaled and operated independently
increasing fault tolerance is a great
reason you know you don't want to have
the fact that your caches are bad to
ruin you know other parts of your
website you know maybe parts of your
application don't need the database so
don't need the cash there's no reason
why one system should you know ruin
another or if you lose them it you know
one cash machine you shouldn't lose the
ability to handle app server requests as
well so two different processes aren't
competing for resources we didn't really
talk about this one but you know when
you've got an app server and a database
on the same machine they use your
computer in very different ways and
having two machines running one a nap
serving one a database and many cases
under high load will actually doubly
outperform a single machine because
you've got the machine can make use of
its own caching you know the processor
cash and the OS cash and all that sort
of stuff that will be constantly being
trampled by you know your app your app
server trampling your databases caching
and vice versa so separating processes
that behave wildly differently from each
other on two separate physical machines
that makes a lot of sense and also so
these systems can be updated
independently so you want to switch from
postgrads to my sequel or you want to
switch from memcache to read us or
something like that well there's no
reason why you need to take down the
rest of your site to do that you can
update these pieces one at a time you
know as you need to so these are all
reasons why you want to separate your
services and it's good even if you have
all these services on the same machine
initially that there's some kind of
walls between them so that you know have
them communicate over TCP or communicate
over some other sub system such that
when you switch to having separate
machines you don't have to rewrite your
whole web application you know you don't
have to react attacked everything just
kind of moving different programs around
so that's kind of one of the big keys to
scaling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
