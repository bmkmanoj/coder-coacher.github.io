given a string such as the one I have
here hello to all of you 44 and we
output the sum of all the integer
numbers in the string so here we have
two and 44 and we're going to return the
number 2 + 44 with some advanced math is
46 so how are we going to solve this
well one way using only the tools you
had in cs101 might be to iterate through
the string character by character
checking if the current character is a
number and then continue concatenating
that string of numbers until we don't
reach a number so fort would have to and
then we hit a space and then we add two
to our total running some that isn't a
very elegant way to do that we'd rather
use regular expressions to help us out
so to get us there let's think of a
regular expression that matches the
numbers that we are looking for well
numbers range 0 through 9 and we want
one or more of them and that's it so
we're going to use a friend re dot final
with this regular expression in the
input string and for everything that's
matched we add it to our running some
let's write a bit of code to do just
that I remember to import the re library
and I've defined my procedure some nums
that takes in one parameter that is the
sense I've now written the regular
expression that we came up with
previously and i initialize my sum to
zero and now i'm going to run find all
with this regular expression on the
input sense and it's going to return a
list of all the occurrences of that
regular expression in this case a list
of all the numbers so found is going to
equal one at a time all the numbers
found in our input sense and remember
from the hint given in the problem the
int procedure will turn a string into an
integer if it so applies and so we're
going to update our some with the
integers that we find in the string and
once we're done we're going to return
the sum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
