imagine you're working on a traffic
light system we have three colors in
here red amber and green now we have a
little piece of code in here which
impacts the traffic based on the traffic
light let's assume this is part of some
traffic simulation so if the light is
red then the traffic should stop if the
light is amber then the traffic should
prepare to step and if the light is
green then the traffic should go now
being good programmers we always assume
that something goes wrong if the light
is neither read nor ember nor green
which in principle shouldn't happen
which due to some bug could happen what
should be here where the question mark
is I'll give you four choices first we
print out this can't happen on the
console in the hope that somebody will
eventually see it second we raise an
assertion exception meaning that the
program will immediately abort third we
write down assert falls thereby clearly
documenting that this is not expected or
last option we write down Pass which is
a Python statement which does nothing at
all after all this bug in the traffic
light may well eventually go away at the
next cycle when we actually go back into
some defined state which of these four
is the best option to go down here
considering the pros and cons about
assertions that we've seen over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
