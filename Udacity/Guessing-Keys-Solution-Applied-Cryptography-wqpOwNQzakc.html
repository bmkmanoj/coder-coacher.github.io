can cancel that out so we're left with
Delta M XOR with Delta s well that could
be zero either if Delta M is equal to
zero and Delta s is equal to 0 then the
XOR of zero and zero would be zero the
probability that Delta M is zero well we
know that that's zero point six one and
we're going to multiply that by the
probability of Delta s is zero which we
know is zero point seven three but
that's not the only way Delta Z could be
zero the other way Delta Z could be zero
is if both of these are one so it's the
probability they're both zero plus the
probability they're both 1 and these
probabilities are 1 minus the
probabilities that we have before so
it's 1 minus 0.6 1 times 1 minus 0.72 3
and if you calculate all that you get
zero point five five zero six that's
probably a little more precise than it
should be especially because this value
is just a guess we'd have to do a much
more detailed analysis German to know
whether that probability is really zero
point 6 1 and we have to know more about
the particular messages that might be
encrypted but this value is pretty far
away from 1/2 any advantage that's that
large if we have a lot of text we're
going to see that pretty clearly so if
we have enough text we can count the
number of positions where Delta Z is
equal to 0 if it's close to half of them
well then it was the wrong guess if it's
close to 0.55 of them then we have a
good likelihood that that was the right
guess so now all we have to do is feed
in the intercepted messages our guesses
for the starting position of the two
keys we need to compute a big summation
of these values of the Delta Z values
with those keys and if it's close to so
the length of the message divided by 2
well that means it was a bad guess we
weren't able to cancel out the key if
it's close to 0.55 times the size of Z
well then it's a good key
it's likely that that's a good guess and
then we should be able to use those key
guesses to find out what the actual
message was to decrypt the ciphertext so
this is exactly the problem that what is
arguably the first electronic digital
computer was built to solve
so with this advantage there's a good
likelihood that you would be able to
know when you guess the right key you
need to try all the configurations of k0
and k1 and for each one of those
configurations you have to compute this
double Delta what we're computing for
each configuration is this double Delta
the XOR of two deltas and that involves
computing all these X ORS
we need the XOR of the keys stored with
the messages and the s wheels but
remember what we're doing is guessing
that this is zero we don't have any way
to predict those s values we're
producing the key values and we're
exhorting those key values with the
intercepted cipher text so we need to do
these X or X throwing out the key and X
narrowing the key with the value of the
cipher text so for each character we're
doing seven X doors and we're counting
the number of times that's equal to zero
so multiplying all those together we
know the total number of XOR is we need
to do so we get about forty four and a
half million that's the maximum number
that we might need to do if we're lucky
we might get the right configuration
right away and we could know that that's
the right configuration by getting the
high number of zeros out if we're
unlucky we might need all 1271 normally
we should expect to need about half of
that so maybe on average we would need
about 25 million next doors to find the
configuration the correct value of x k 1
and k 0 for one ciphertext
once we've got K 1 and K 0 well we can
do similar things to find K 2 K 3 and K
4 and then we can decrypt the whole
message so today modern processor runs
at 2 gigahertz so you're doing 2 billion
operations per second and one operation
could include mini X or x' possibly 64 x
doors or 32 xor
depending on your processor so to do
that on a modern processor would take a
fraction of the millisecond to do that
in 1941 was a major technical challenge
computers didn't exist yet but this was
the main impetus for building what was
arguably the first electronic
programmable digital computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
