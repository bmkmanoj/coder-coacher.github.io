network is useful so every time someone
who receives a transaction they don't
just accept it what they do is they they
send it into the peer-to-peer network so
when someone wants to verify a coin what
they need to do is send it into the
peer-to-peer network every transaction
in that coin can be verified by all the
other members of the network and before
the transaction is considered valid we
need to know that that coin hasn't been
already spent in some other way so
there's two important parts to this so
that means all the nodes must agree on
all the transactions and that requires
some sort of timestamp nodes are going
to receive messages at different times
we need to know it's the case that if if
this coin was spent twice that before
this one validates the transaction we
need to ensure that if someone attempted
to spend a point twice both transactions
wouldn't be validated by having
different parts of the network have
different views of that history of all
the transactions so how do we provide
this time step and we need to remember
that some of these nodes might be
malicious we have no way to know that
all the nodes are trusted anyone who
wants can join the network we just need
to have some honest parties to validate
the transactions but we need to know
that dishonest parties can't invalidate
the history of transactions the key to
this is requiring a proof of work for
each time step we're going to have a new
block and we need to know that creating
those new blocks requires work if it
requires enough work to increase the
time step then it's unlikely that a
malicious user can increase the time
step faster than the whole network so
how do we make that hard we need some
kind of proof of work to be embedded in
the time steps so here's a way to do a
proof of work in order to prove you've
done some amount of work you need to
find a value of X where the hash of X
starts with some number of zeros doing
that requires work if this is a good
cryptographic hash function at least if
we have a random Oracle assumption about
that hash function the only way to find
such an x value is to keep guessing and
looking at the output so you need to do
the amount of
work necessary to find that outputting
so how much work is that so how many
times do we expect to need to compute
the hash function H in order to find a
value of X where H of X starts with zero
to the 10 starts with ten consecutive
zeros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
