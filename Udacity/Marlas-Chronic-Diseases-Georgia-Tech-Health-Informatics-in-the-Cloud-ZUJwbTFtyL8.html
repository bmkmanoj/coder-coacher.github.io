chronic diseases she developed diabetes
15 years ago and is now showing early
signs of lung problems called chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD
for short in recent years her blood
pressure has become elevated and she is
also taking medications for that she was
also recently diagnosed with a heart
problem called coronary artery disease
and needs even more medications we
already know one thing about chronic
diseases they can't be cured maula
illustrates two other key points they
are often caused by behavior malas
obesity is caused by her poor diet rich
in processed foods with too many
calories from fats and carbohydrates
combined with far too little physical
activity this weight gain contributed to
her developing diabetes and high blood
pressure her lung disease was caused by
her smoking the second key point about
chronic diseases is they can cause other
chronic diseases Marla's diabetes and
high blood pressure contributed to the
development of her heart disease and
puts her a greater risk for heart attack
for stroke if her diabetes and high
blood pressure are not well controlled
she could develop chronic kidney disease
and other more serious problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
