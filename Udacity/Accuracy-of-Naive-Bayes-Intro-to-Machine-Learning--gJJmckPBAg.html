there there's going to be one more thing
that I'm going to ask you to do before
we finish with this unit and that is to
evaluate our classifier to quantify how
well it's doing at classifying points at
whether they're terrain that we can
drive fast on or terrain where we have
to go more slowly so the metric that
we're going to use in this case to
decide how well our algorithm is doing
is the accuracy accuracy is just the
number of points that are classified
correctly divided by the total number of
points in the test set so the quiz that
I want you to answer right now is to
tell me what the accuracy is of this
naive Bayes classifier that we've just
made and so there are two different ways
that we can do this the first is that
you can actually take the the
predictions that you've made here and
you can compare them to the labels in
your test set or what you can actually
do is head back over to the scikit-learn
documentation and see if there's some
scikit-learn function that might be able
to take care of this for you
so computing this accuracy element by
element is one way that you can do it or
if you want to be a little bit more
adventurous go check out the
documentation and maybe there's a really
cool one-liner that you can use from SK
learn that'll take care of this for you
okay so the quiz question is basically
do this calculation either on your own
or using SK learn and tell me how
accurate our classifier is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
