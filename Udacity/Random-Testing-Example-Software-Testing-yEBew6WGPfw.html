like that killed clang so here we have a
bunch of preamble stuff at the top and
let's get down to the random code okay
here's the random code itself that's
what you can see is it just basically
it's just a bunch of random junk and so
what are we doing here we're making
function calls we have a little integer
constant we have some relational
operators and so this is a largest
program let's see how big it is this
program is oh it's not that big at 1600
lines or 37 kilobytes of code but right
now we don't know what about that
program it was that caused clang to
crash all we know is that crashed it so
let's just look and make sure that that
works okay good so here you can see the
clang did indeed die on that input and
so we can see that here we see the
assertion failure unknown live in to the
entry block and then the rest of this is
just a bunch of sort of other
information that clang gives when it
crashes for example it's a stack trace
of functions that were actually a
functions over executing when the
compiler crashed it's giving us a
detailed version of the arguments and
some other stuff so this is all stuff
that we would include in the bug report
when I report this bug to the ala VM
developers which I'll do tonight after I
finish recording lectures so let's see
now if we found anything about GCC
that's interesting and so here we saw
that LVM always includes this assertion
string when it crashes and GCC includes
a different message all the time it's
internal compiler error okay and so we
can see here is that several times GCC
responded with a message saying that was
killed and these do not represent
compiler bugs that were interested in
these are just performance pathologies
where the compiler ran for quite a while
on some random input those tend to be
hard to report as bugs so we're not
gonna worry about that we can see is
that there was one internal compiler
error where verify SSA failed I believe
that's a known bug so we're not gonna
worry about it there's a segmentation
fault or GCC crashed and most often
that's due to dereferencing a null
pointer we're not gonna worry about that
either there's an error and get loop
body that happens to be a known bug ever
if that bug has been reported and then
we have error here which looks to me to
be new we have internal compiler error
and get initial def for induction at
tree vector and so tree vector means
that error was in the loop vectorizer
which is a module of GCC that's been
getting quite a bit of development and
quite a bit of attention in recent years
this is a place where we would sort of
expect to find bugs and so I'm not gonna
go generate the program to cause this
crash since we already saw that example
for clang basically we've seen here is
how a random testing loop works and so
if we actually look at the activity on
this machine we can see that lots of
programs are running here involving
program is one of the driver scripts for
the random tester C Smith of course is a
random test case generator C c1 and
clang our compiler processes this
compiler is sitting here using all eight
cores on a rather fast modern machine in
order to break compilers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
