because we are simulating our app on
iPhone 5s which has a Retina display
Retina display means more pixels and
therefore more quality so what the
simulator is looking for is a 2x image
it's looking for this image right here
which by the way is just 2 times the
size of the One X and here I have the
same microphone image except that it's
size is 200 by 200 pixels this is twice
as big as the previous image we used by
the way this image is also available in
the instructor notes so what I'm going
to do is drag this image into the 2x
there all right I'll go back to Xcode
and then stop the project and run it
again
aha the image isn't blurry anymore by
the way this form of attention to design
detail is extremely important when
building apps for the Apple ecosystem
and because it's so important let's dive
a little bit deeper into seeing what's
actually going on here behind the scenes
the thing to understand here is that the
1x scale factor works with non retina
phones and these were used in all die--
phones like the iPhone 3G the 2x scale
factor however has a Retina screen and
this is used in phones like the iPhone 4
and 5s a form that uses the Retina
screen in this case means double the
number of pixels as compared to a non
Retina screen and that is what produces
a much better quality for these phones
so when we use an image from 1x in a
phone like iPhone 5s the image looks
somewhat blurry as this phone is
expecting a 2x image now you can imagine
that the 3x scale factor is used for
newer phones phones like the iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 plus if you want to learn
more about this we've added a couple of
helpful links in the instructor notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
