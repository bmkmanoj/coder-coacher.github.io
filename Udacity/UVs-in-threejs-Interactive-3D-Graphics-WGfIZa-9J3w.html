along with their own UVs built in some
of these are displayed here for planar
objects the texture is put flat against
the face for round objects the general
idea is that the u-value goes from 0 to
1 around the equator and V goes from 0
to 1 along the axis to be honest the
mapping on the bottom of the cone shown
here is pretty but doesn't make a lot of
sense to me maybe you'll be the one to
fix it note that 3j s truly is a work in
progress and anyone can submit bug fixes
and improvements I should also point out
the tetrahedron it's mapping is a bit
distorted in fact if you look at the
code no UV mapping is given at all and
3gs creates one using some rules
sometimes there simply is no natural UV
mapping for the object being made its
then pretty much up to the programmer to
decide how to proceed what is happening
with each of these objects is that the
UVs are generated by the geometry class
used to create the triangles the form
for making a triangle with you v's is
this code here three vertices are
defined and put inside the geometry
object three UVs are created I put them
in an array so I can reuse any that I
want a face is defined as usual the
three numbers given our indices to the
three vertex locations in the vertices
array the way the three UVs are attached
to this face is a little non-standard
the first element of the face vertex U
visa is accessed and the three UVs we
want to use for this face are directly
placed there if you want to add more
faces with you vs note that you'll
access the face vertex u v's class the
same way each time you'll access array
element zero and pass in the three UVs
desired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
