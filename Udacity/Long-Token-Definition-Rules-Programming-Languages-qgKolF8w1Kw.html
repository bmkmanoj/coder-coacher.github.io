about the length of writing down a bunch
of regular expression rules or tokens
for a language the basic question was
something like this seems to go on
forever I can imagine having to write
down so many token definition rules that
I would expire of boredom before we ever
finished is that what happens in the
real world what's it like my answer to
this is to some degree there's no silver
bullet there's no single easy way to
encode structured information to bring
order from chaos but what I can tell you
is that it is a totally surmountable
task for real world languages I've been
associated with a lexer and a parser a
front end for the C programming language
to handle the C programming language
which has a lot of gory details our list
of token definitions was 600 lines long
that might seem like a lot if you're
writing it out all at once but in the
grand scheme of things a normal program
like the Firefox web browser is multiple
millions of lines long so this list of
regular expressions this list of token
definitions is actually a very miniscule
part of the entire software engineering
effort I was also involved in the
creation of a lexer and parser and
interpreter for java java 11 at the time
and our list of tokens our token
definition file was 200 lines long java
was a bit more regular than C in that
regard didn't require the lexer hack
which you can ask me about at some later
point 200 lines is even more reasonable
finally I think in one of the videos at
some point I mention a particular Tetris
game that I had the pleasure of working
on and there was a piece definition
language that let me use the planner
pentominoes instead of the normal for
length Tetris pieces there the piece
definition reader was more like 90 lines
long which is Steven which is seeming
even smaller and more tractable but the
way you really want to think about this
is more like say reasoning by analogy is
it a lot of work to build a road is it a
lot of work to build a sewer system is
it a lot of work to paint a beautiful
picture yes but you do the work once and
then you amortize the costs for everyone
who gets a chance
to enjoy that construction yes it takes
a long time to pave a road but after
that many people can drive over it often
language definitions like C or Java or C
sharp or JavaScript they don't change
very quickly or if they change at all
once you've taken the time to write down
all of your token definitions for
JavaScript even if it is a few hundred
lines long you look at it you write some
test cases you feel good about it you do
a Code walkthrough with someone else and
then you're done and you can just build
upon that take advantage of it for the
rest of your software development career
so it can be a bit arduous to write down
a bunch of token definitions especially
since a lot of them seen the same but
you do it once and then it's over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
