assignment we're going to take a look at
the complexity of parsing certain
strings of input under certain grammars
is it the case that certain grammars are
more difficult to parse with the
algorithms that we've given is it the
case that certain strings are more
difficult to parse with the same our
algorithms and just in case it wasn't
clear this is definitely a challenge
problem and very very difficult so
please don't be upset if you weren't
able to get a good solution if you did
get a working solution I hope you shared
it on the forums with your fellow
students and discussed how you got there
so to recap we're trying to answer the
question how much work is it the parse
and before we answer that we need to
decide in some way to measure this work
we could take the time that it takes to
run the parsing maybe measure in seconds
or minutes we could take the energy when
you have a web browser in something like
my phone then we need to decide whether
or not our web browser is efficient
enough not to drain my phone for hours
into the day I'm sure that's happened to
some of you before so this might be
measured in watts or some other
measurement of power there's something
wrong with each of these forms of
measurements and that is it doesn't
really get at the algorithm if i buy a
faster computer does that mean my purser
is better no if I build a more
energy-efficient phone does that mean
the parser is better not really so
measuring in such units would imply that
our algorithms get better over time as
the hardware does but the truth is many
algorithms haven't gotten better since
when they were first developed inside
the 70s so we want a unit of
measurements that isn't dependent on the
hardware we're running on that way if I
test my parser I can compare it to your
parser even though it's very unlikely
we're running the exact same computer
instead we're going to define our own
unit of measurement for now let's call
it a
operation we're going to count the
number of work operations it takes to
parse a given list of tokens a given
string in our grammar for this problem
you are asked to give two things a
grammar and a list of tokens that takes
at least two X X X work operations to
parse where X is going to be defined as
the maximum number of input tokens or
the size of the largest grammar role or
the number of rules so why is this
definition special it means that we
can't just give a really long list of
tokens and expect to reach two times
what is essentially X cubed work
operations we have to find something
that given the relative size of the
grammar the tokens and the rules is more
work to parse the key to solving this
problem is actually ambiguity it turns
out ambiguity really slows down the
parsing process given the set of rules
that we've defined for parsing a given
list of tokens so let's look at a really
ambiguous grammar this grammar matches a
sequence of exes but because of this
rule right here it's very very ambiguous
as it turns out that if you have 15 or
more X's in a row you'll actually break
the 2 times X cubed mark for parsing but
for the sake of demonstrating this I'm
going to just show you what the parse
chart looks like with 5 x's so here I've
taken the code given in the problem
uncommented the section that prints the
chart and I've run the grammar that we
had on a string of five tokens the
results is as follows right from the
get-go there's a lot of different roles
that we can match and with every step we
keep getting more and more possibilities
dude at all the ambiguity everywhere
that we could possibly have
p we're putting in two more piece and
then from there even two more piece as
it turns out for n characters we get
about N squared possible parse trees and
that means the size of our chart alone
includes a lot more than the possible
parse trees and we do a lot more work
operations as we try to go through that
so by the end we've done 3237 units of
work now if we increase the number of
tokens to something like 50 we get a
very long par chart I'll just keep
scrolling until I hit the bottom gets
longer and longer and longer oh my gosh
does it end here we go yeah it gets
pretty big oh one thing to note that i
didn't do in my examples was that the
length of your input needed to be
greater than 10 and less than 50 and by
input i mean the number X so here I had
access 50 and before I had it at five
but that's why neither of these were
accepted so if you did something say 11
you would get a success that encourages
you to copy it down and submit it I hope
you had fun doing this problem it's a
bit more creative than what we've had in
the past and there's many many right
answers I hope to see some of those
answers on the forum until then bye-bye
I'll end with a smiley face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
