played around when telnet in unit 1 - to
manipulate web service directly I'm
gonna go ahead and do that here and we
can look at some more HTTP headers so if
I were to tell that to Google comm you
know port 80 as we've been doing so we
do our HTTP requests to get the front
page remember our host header we see our
results we scroll up to the top of this
we can see our our header so here's the
request I made and here are the headers
and here are a couple set cookie header
so on this one this sets a cookie named
pref to this value and it's actually
google's doing a very typical google
thing and storing multiple pieces of
data in one cookie so this is the equal
sign that's part of the cookie header
and this equal sign is actually part of
the cookie value this is the end of the
cookie value here we've got a semicolon
and then we have some extra parameters
that we haven't talked about yet we have
an expires time and this is when the
cookie expires so after the state April
19 2014 this cookie will no longer be
sent and this cookie is relative or
relevant to the path slash so you can
restrict cookies to specific paths and
this cookie is specific to google.com
and so this basically means that you
know anybody on google.com will receive
this cookie here is a another another
cookie this one's called n ID and you
know you can see the value comes all the
way down here till 4 semicolon expires
time of its own a path a domain um some
extra constraints this cookies only and
relevant to HTTP which which is just
another another cookie option you have
at your disposal I wanna show you one
quick thing while we're in the terminal
here if you're on Mac or Linux you can
use the curl command which is pretty
cool
say curl - I which basically says get me
the headers curl - I google comm and
that'll just run the headers I'm not
gonna quiz you on that but if you're on
a UNIX machine you can use curl instead
of Telma and you don't have to you know
type so fast and type so much stuff so
anyway curl - I handle all tool for for
viewing HTTP headers I'll show you one
last way to inspect cookies this may not
work for everybody but it's it's another
neat experiment
Here I am in Chrome I'm in a you know a
special private browsing mode which is
what all this is talking about basically
I'm in the private browsing mode because
I don't want to have any cookies and
that's generally what these private
browsing modes do is they throw away all
your cookies so I'm gonna I'm gonna do
something here I've opened up the debug
tools in Chrome these are some developer
tools that are built in the chrome you
can google around for how to show these
in chrome or you know Safari and
Internet Explorer also have a similar
feature so you can kind of watch
requests and I'm going to go to
google.com and down here I can see all
the requests we made at google.com and
one thing I can do is I can actually
view the headers we can actually view
the request header I made for google.com
and you can see we sent some various
headers we didn't send any cookies
because we don't have any and if we
scroll down a little bit we can see you
know one of the cookies that got set
right here this is one of the cookie
headers set cookie if we were to reload
this page now our browser chrome here
has stored this cookie if we were to
reload this page we should see a new
request header so I'll do that now I've
reloaded the page and now we can see the
request we made for the two google.com
the request has a cookie header and this
has the exact same contents as the set
cookie or at least the name here and the
value are the same you don't have to
resend path and domain and all those
other options those are just for the
browser to know when to send the cookie
if you're feeling adventurous you can
find a debug mode in your browser and
experiment this sort of stuff it's kind
of it's kind of neat to see what's there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
