reduction we're going to reduce the
problem of finding an independent set in
the graph to data finding a vertex cover
in the next lesson we're going to argue
that if P is not equal to NP then
independent set is not in P so vertex
cover can't be either but that's getting
ahead of ourselves first for the benefit
of those not already familiar with these
problems we will state them briefly
first we'll consider the independent set
problem and see how it is equivalent to
the klique problem that we talked about
when we introduced the class NP given a
graph a subset of the vertices is an
independent set if there are no edges
between the vertices in the set s for
example these two vertices here do not
form an independent set because there's
an edge between however these three
vertices do form an independent set
because there are no edges between them
clearly each individual vertex forms an
independent set since there isn't
another vertex in the set for to have an
edge width and the more vertices we add
the harder it is to find new ones to add
so finding a maximum independent set is
the interesting question or phrased as a
decision problem the question becomes
given a graph G and an integer K at most
the number of vertices does G have an
independent set of size K note that this
problem is in NP given a subset of the
vertices it's easy to count them to make
sure that there are and D 2k and check
that there are no edges between them
this problem is so close to the clique
problem that the two are usually
considered as one it set as independent
in a graph if and only if it is a clique
in the complement graph but the
complement graph I mean the one where
there is no edge if there was an edge
between two vertices in the original and
there is an edge if there wasn't one in
the original not having any edges
between a set of vertices in the
original graph is the same as having all
the edges among the vertices in the
complement graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
