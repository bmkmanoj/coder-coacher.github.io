first expression is always zero no
matter what string s is we always find s
at the beginning of itself so if you
think of s as any string if we search
for the string hello in hello well we're
going to find hello at the beginning of
hello
and that's position 0 that's what fine
will return no matter what the string s
is the result of s defined s will always
be 0 the result of s dot fine passing in
the string s will only be 0 if s started
with the letter s so this is not always
true the third example always is true so
here we have the string s that's a
string with 1 character s and what we're
trying to find in it is the string s
well we find that at position 0 so
that's the result find will produce the
fourth one gets a little more tricky so
here we're looking in the string s we're
looking for the empty string remember
the definition of fine says that will
give us the first occurrence where that
string appears well the empty string
appears in s we don't actually see it
but it's there we found the empty string
there's no string there no matter what s
is we can find the empty string in it
because we don't need any string to find
the empty string so the result of s dot
fine passing an empty string will always
be 0 no matter what the string s is so
the final one is also always 0 and the
reason for this is when we search an s
for the string s plus 3 exclamation
points well no matter what s is so even
if it was a string that already included
three exclamation points so let's
suppose that's the value of s what we're
trying to find is now S Plus 3
exclamation points so that's going to be
what we had before plus 3 more
exclamation points searching for that
within the string S will never be found
and we know it can't be found because
this string is actually longer than the
string s that we started with so the
result of this expression is always
going to be negative 1 that means the
string was never never found we add 1 to
that we get 0 that's why this expression
will always evaluate to 0 no matter what
the value of S is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
