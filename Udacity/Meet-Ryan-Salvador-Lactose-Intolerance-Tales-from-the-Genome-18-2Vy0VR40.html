but I'm from Maryland and I am lactose
intolerant for everybody out there who
doesn't know what lactose intolerance is
tell us briefly what being lactose
intolerant means and briefly it means I
can't have milk or other dairy products
without experiencing some discomfort I
say discomfort and can you elaborate a
little bit under discomfort typically
mean its digestive discomfort so it's
gas bloating diarrhea that sort of thing
is anyone else in your family lactose
intolerant yes my younger sister is but
I have a brother who is not and my
parents or not okay um so do you do you
have any experience with this being a
genetic trait like dude does this run in
your family being lactose intolerant I
actually don't know because most of my
family lives in the philippines and they
don't drink cow milk they have the they
drink powdered milk and all this and not
dairy products because it's not as
popular there so it wasn't until I
discovered I was lactose intolerant that
I learned anything about it and when did
you discover that you're lactose
intolerant I would say that would be
about two or three years ago so really
that late in life on yes but they when I
found out I was lactose intolerant it
kind of explained some things from when
I was younger because there are times
like when I would have dairy products
and I'd be fine but then there's times
if I had too much at felt I felt a
little gassy but when I discovered I was
lactose intolerant it kind of made sense
that if I was young and overloaded on it
it made sense that then I would feel
discomfort I see so when you were young
though you felt like you could have
normal amounts and you were okay right
it wasn't until graduate school until
yeah about two years ago that I
discovered I was lactose intolerant and
I think it's because that's when it kind
of just when it really kind of shut off
right right how did that make you feel
to sort of discovered this about
yourself well like I said it kind of
made sense to me because it explained a
lot of things about why I'd randomly
feel sick some days and why wouldn't
other days and just depended on
breakfast but it was kind of annoying to
find out mostly because I knew it would
have to I'd have to either change my
diet or write other things so what are
the kinds of foods you actually
to avoid if you are lactose intolerant
person if you're lactose intolerant and
you're not taking any type of supplement
then you basically have to avoid
anything that has an appreciable amount
of dairy products in it so obviously I'm
not going to be drinking straight milk
ice cream pizzas with a lot of cheese on
it taco tacos American style tacos
burritos all those things cake
cheesecake so what you're saying is that
there's a lot of food restrictions yes
it is a there's a lot a huge part of the
diet that is has dairy products in it
and so discovering the octos at our kind
of makes it more difficult to get that
sorted so do you find yourself in
situations I guess social situations
where you see if food come out you're
like oh gosh you really want that and
you're like oh gosh I can't eat it yes
especially I do ok I do try to carry
around lactase pills lactase enzyme
pills but if I don't have them then yes
if someone's like let's go out for ice
cream I go oh I guess I can't yeah if
there's pizza especially if people you
know at the last minute want to get
pizza or certain go out for dinner and
we haven't decided if they just like
just pizza hut I have to go ahead I
can't really eat that our people
receptive to this when you tell them
like if you tell a group of friends or
even new people hey I'm like us and
tolerant you know can you know can we do
something else can we get something else
or people normally receptive yes
especially in California actually
because in California a lot of people
are no people with various dietary
restrictions or different diets and so
it's definitely hasn't really affected
my social life it just means that we do
something else you mentioned lactase
pills what exactly is a lactase pedal
and where do you get it how much does it
cause I lacked a spill is just a little
pill about and a little less than an
inch big by a quarter inch that is just
a number of units of lactase enzyme so
lactose intolerance means my body
doesn't produce lactase anymore which is
the enzyme that breaks down lactose
sugar into two different triggers so
this pill I eat it I always buy the fast
act pills so I can just eat it with my
first bite of food and it kind of
dissolves and has to break down all the
sugars
my stomach and so I take that with my
first bite of dairy and then I'm usually
good for about 45 minutes before I have
to take another one well how much do
they cost um I would say it's about ten
cents of pill so 120 would be about
twelve to thirteen dollars at safeway
for example um is this a tree you would
ever want to change about yourself at
all definitely I just feel I mean being
lactose intolerant just means I can't
live my same life and eat the same
amount of eat the same foods and do the
same things I want to but I just have to
spend more money to do it because I by
the lactase lactose free milk and I by
the lactase pills to supplement other
meals have you ever gotten your own
personal genetic information done from a
company like 23andme yes I have and did
what did that tell you about you being
lactose intolerant did it confirm this
or it confirmed I have the genotype that
is likely lactose intolerant because
since lactose intolerant can also depend
on environmental factors like your your
actual gut bacteria that breaks down the
lactose it means I have the tendency to
be lactose intolerant but it doesn't
mean I am the only way you can confirm
that you are is to kind of know that you
are what would you say if you could give
advice to somebody who let's say we're
talking to Ryan three years ago before
he found out it was lactose intolerant
and he you know just discovered that
you're lactose intolerant what advice
would you give that person I think the
first advice would be to test your
limits on lactose tolerance so I can
have a bite of ice cream or one nacho
with cheese or but that won't bother so
like knowing your limit on what you can
have without any kind of supplement is
useful and also to just make the
decision whether you're going to change
your diet or by the pills or some kind
of combination of both just kind of
figure it out or and looking to lactose
free alternatives to milk or they even
have lactose free ice cream now but it's
very expensive so it's like is it worth
it to buy the ice cream so you don't
have to take pills or do you want to
take pills every single time you eat ice
cream sort of thing it's kind of just
decide all the different ways to manage
your archos intolerance and
figure out which way is the best for you
well thank you for coming in and
chatting with us yeah thanks for talking
I don't get to talk about this day off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
