we think is private also something we
thought perhaps is not private and then
we talked about the threats how that
information can potentially be abused
violating our privacy so one thing that
companies do companies that we interact
with the in the online world is that
they have privacy policy so they say if
you're going to track what you do what
are we going to keep and from collect
information that we think you might see
as private well you know how exactly
what we can do with that we're going to
define that in a privacy policy most
websites have these privacy policies how
many of us actually look at them
carefully that's a different question so
we're going to look at one example who
else to go but google that knows knows a
lot about you has likes that information
builds a profile for you so let's sort
of look into what is collected why is it
collected how can it be shared this is
all captured in this policy that Google
has so let's see some details of that
policy so let's start with what
information is collected about us by
Google well all kind of personal
information we agreed to give it to
Google actually name email address red
card number telephone number Gmail now
does stronger authentication using your
telephone number this is information
that we provide to Google when we set up
an account you create an account this is
our personal information you giving it
to Google essentially it's private
information so you know how it what can
be done with it of course we want to
address that with visit certain websites
so use you know Google services of
course that Google will know about it
and they can track and record it and
Google's business model is that they use
it for advertising so we know why
they're doing that they actually have
information about your device from where
you coming to Google so what kind of
hardware it is the operating system is
running its IP address network
information and so on so they would have
that interestingly in case of Google
they would also know your search queries
what kind of
things you look for on the on the
internet what kind of information you're
interested in if you use Google Voice
they would know who you call how long
you talk and we're going to cookies are
sort of more general mechanism by which
websites keep track of various type of
information in particular when we
registered them before and and and and
things like that
so cookies in some state they keep on
our machine about what we have done with
respect to these websites in the past
they Google actually does set cookies
that they're going to use to track your
activities that you do they also collect
your location information what kind of
applications you use all this is what is
collected it's a privacy policy should
say this is the information we collect
about you well this is an example of
what Google collects about you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
