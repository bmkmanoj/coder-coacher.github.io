this last time what we were really doing
was taking one expression 87 w plus 72 n
and subtracting from it another
expression 3w plus 12 n we worked with
parentheses in a kind of new way so
let's take a second and talk a bit more
explicitly about how to add and subtract
polynomials let's start out by comparing
what the difference is between
subtracting polynomials and adding
polynomials this first expression is
what we dealt with in the last quiz and
we saw that because there's a minus sign
in front of a quantity with parentheses
around it we need to change the sign of
the operator that's in front of the 12 n
here that's inside the parentheses so
here's what we ended up with we said
that we need to subtract both the 3w and
the 12 n so both of them have minus
signs in front of them now what if
instead though we decided to add them so
you want to add this entire quantity
that's inside the parentheses so here's
a little quiz what terms would you put
in this green box right here to
correctly complete this expression over
here the key here is that I want you to
get rid of these parentheses that around
the 3w plus 12 n and show me how doing
that changes the expression I've already
put a plus sign right here for you so
that means that if you want the first
term in the box to be negative then I'd
like you to put a negative sign in front
of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
