a ranking yes yes I think I am okay well
give me a ranking them so it's did you
say one was the best one is the best and
three is the least best all right so I
am really excited about the third cloud
structure the third attribute to be
split on because what it does is it
takes all our X's and O's that need to
have different labels and it puts them
into two different buckets one where
they all get to be red x's and the other
one where they all get to be green O's
so I would say the far right one is
ranked number one I would agree with you
and in fact I would say that in fact
we're done yeah it's perfect it is
perfect agreed one is perfect or three
is perfect in this case because I gave
it a one all right so then the worst one
I think is also easy to pick because if
you look at the middle attribute the
attribute that's move shown in the
middle we take all the data and we put
it all on the Left so we really have
just kicked the can down the road a
little bit there's nothing that this
attribute splitting has done so I would
call that the worst possible thing you
could do which is basically to do
nothing no I think that's right and in
fact it really is doing nothing right
okay so what about the first attribute
so I'm gonna put that it you know if the
first one is too hot and the middle one
is too cold I would say this one is wait
no no it's going down the Goldilocks
path so this one is sort of in between
in that it it splits things so you have
smaller sets of data to deal with but it
actually hasn't really improved our
ability to tell the Reds and the greens
apart so in fact I'd almost want to put
this as three also but I but I'll put it
as two okay yeah I think an argument
could be made for making it three an
argument could be made for making it to
your point is actually pretty good right
we we had sort of a tread things and
eight green things up here and the kind
of distribution between them sort of
half red and half red x's half green
nose we have the same distribution after
we go through this attribute here so it
does some splitting but it's
you still end up with half red half
green half xfo so that's not a lot of
help but it's certainly better than
doing absolutely nothing
well is it though I mean it seems like
it could also be the case that what
we've done is we've added an attribute
that we're now splitting on that has
provided no valuable information and
therefore can only contribute to
overfitting that's now that's a good
point that's a good point so you want to
change your answer to three I don't know
what did you what did you want the
answer to be I mean it seems to me that
the first and second one are just plain
bad they are just plain bad the question
is whether one is more bad than the
other I don't know I don't had a check
well I'll tell you I would accept either
two or three as an answer here I think
you can make an argument either way and
I think you actually made both argument
that's very nice of you thank you thank
you very welcome so this is perfect this
is the House of Representatives and this
is the Senate what do you mean there Oh
so there you go okay I'm not exactly
sure what you mean but it seemed somehow
denigrating to our political system it
is not at all denigrating it is it is I
would call an incisive political satire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
