semantic network as a representation for
this particular class of problem given
that how would you apply the generator
and test matter to this problem David so
it sounds like what I would do is I
would use the transformation between a
and B transfer that transformation to C
and use it to generate my answer for D I
didn't take my answer for D and compare
it against one two three four five and
six and see which one most closely
matched what I generated if I wanted to
make my tester and generator even
smarter I might say that in order to be
the correct answer it has to meet the
generated answer with a certain level of
confidence and if it doesn't meet that
level of confidence it should go back
and see if there's a different
transformation we could have transferred
so that would take care of the problem
earlier where either the middle shape
disappeared or the outer shape
disappeared there's a good answer David
it is another way of solving this
problem it is another way of solving
this problem using generator and test in
semantic networks one could take one put
it and D generate the transformation
from C to D and then test it against the
transformation from A to B one could do
the same thing for two put two here in
the D generate the transformation tested
against the transformation from A to B
one could do this for all six choices
and then find out which one of these
transformations is closest the
transformation from A to B thus in this
problem when can use the generated test
methods in two very different ways
although the knowledge representation
remains the same so knowledge
representation captures some knowledge
about the world at a level of
abstraction it is coupled with problem
solving methods but more than one
problem solving method more than one
variation of a problem solving method
might be applicable using technology or
