yeah I'm ready to try to figure it out
all right let's go let's try the first
one I feel like the first one's going to
go rather well so we need a pair of
strategies so that no player is
motivated to switch mm-hmm and you told
us they were pure strategy so we
actually have a nice algorithm for doing
this which is we can just check each one
of them with the definition mm-hmm but
but in the case of prisoner's dilemma I
think a natural place to start would be
that minus 6 minus 6 mm-hmm so let's say
that a chooses the second row and B
chooses the second column let's see if
that's a Nash equilibrium so both
players need to be happy so if would a
be happier switching if I switched it
would be getting minus 9 which is worse
so he's happy where he is and if B
switches b would be getting minus 9 so
boom Nash equilibrium done now I didn't
verify that other ones weren't a Nash
equilibrium but you didn't say find all
of the Nash equilibria you just said
find well you did say find the so you
kind of implied that there's just one
right but actually that's true but you
don't have to check this because we
already went through an exercise where
we knew the answer was minus 6 minus 6
and the way we did that is we noticed
that for a defecting the second row is
always better than this
right and that in particular this row
strictly dominates this row right which
implies that if I picked anything on
this row I would rather move to the
other row and you can see it minus 1 up
zeros better minus 9 minus 6 is better
that's what it means to be strictly
dominated so I'd never picked this row
anyway and the same argument for B for
this column so you'll notice that by
getting rid of the things that are
strictly dominated the only thing we're
left with is this and it turns out in
fact to be a Nash equilibrium
so this is correct so you just told me
how to do my job which makes me a little
sad well this I already had the answer
this but maybe maybe you were signaling
to me how I might attack this next
problem
maybe maybe so a is choosing a row and
gets the first number so is there a row
that weird that dominates all the other
rows
doesn't seem that way mm-hmm but maybe
baby oh okay we'll start with B maybe B
maybe there's a column that dominates
all the other columns but no it looks
like it's totally symmetrical yep so
strictly dominated doesn't necessarily
help here and by necessarily I mean
doesn't so that was kind of mean thank
you all right so oh but we have
something else we could do
yes so there is a the largest number
that anybody can get is six mm-hmm and
there's a play where both of them can
get the six yeah so there's no way
they're gonna want to switch away from
that because everyone's getting their
kind of maximum amount of reward so a
bottom row B right column gets us a Nash
equilibrium and that is in fact correct
and you can see it because from here I
would always it would always be worse
for me
and it would always be worse for me so
these are in fact the Nash equilibria
for these two problems cool they've
seemed easier than I was expecting
mm-hm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
