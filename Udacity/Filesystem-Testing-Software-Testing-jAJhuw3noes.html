at a few examples so the first one is
file system testing we've already talked
about this a little bit so I'm not going
to reintroduce this subject so if we
start with a simple file system tester
what we're probably going to do is make
a list of all the API calls that we'd
like to test so we can mount a nun mount
a file system we can open and close a
file we can create a directory remove a
directory make a list of all those kinds
of functions and basically just call
them randomly with random arguments then
we'll look at the results and think
about them and what we'll see is that
probably they're probably our testing is
highly suboptimal because for example if
we're throwing unmount calls randomly
into the mix we're gonna end up on
average operating on a none mounted file
system at least 50% of the time
similarly if there's no correlation in
randomly chosen file names between
different calls to open closed and read
and write and such we may effectively
never actually perform a reader or write
call on an open file
of course that's obviously undesirable
so we're gonna do then is for example
first is a special case mountain unmount
we're also going to need to almost
certainly special case open and close a
namely one thing that we might want to
do is keep track in the random tester of
the set of currently open files and just
these couple of simple things is
probably enough to get a filesystem
fuzzer off the ground but there's more
we'll probably want to limit the size of
files we don't waste a lot of time
writing many many many gigabytes to
files when we could have be using that
time better perhaps we also want to
limit the height of the directory
hierarchy in order that we don't
generate incredibly deep directory
hierarchies that aren't interesting on
the other hand we may want to do exactly
that we went with exactly test extremely
deep directory hierarchies or extremely
large files but it might be the case
that these are special cases that we
want to test separately from the main
body of our fuzzer ok so what I hope is
that the general pattern is clear here
we start off doing something really
simple
we probably observe that it doesn't work
very well and then we start special
casing things in order to remove
limitations of our random tester and
over time so maybe over weeks or months
or even years this process ends up with
a random tester that will be extremely
strong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
