would use a confidence interval before
we move on well hopefully you're
enjoying the class so far how would we
measure this maybe one way is to look at
the number of minutes that each person
has watched of the videos divided by the
total minutes that are available we
could call this something like the
engagement ratio because this provides
some indication of how engaged you are
if you're watching more video then
you're probably more engaged as of March
11th when I'm recording this there are
eight thousand seven hundred two
students enrolled in the course I made
up this hypothetical data set the link
is below unfortunately I couldn't get
the actual data for every student but I
think the shape is pretty close to what
it really is and that's just the nature
of the MOOC a lot of people sign up
because it's free and easy but they
don't progress through the course or
they just sign up with the intention of
doing it later however if you're taking
the course for credit which I think
about a hundred of you are you're
probably up here on the distribution
making your way through the course to
get credit for it so first of all
calculate the mean and standard
deviation for this data this is a pretty
big data set so try to make use of the
keyboard shortcuts that you've learned
before treat this as a population and
round to the nearest thousandth or three
decimal places</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
