motivation we also have what's called
the drive reduction model and if you
remember from lesson three we talked
about the brain and homeostasis and
homeostasis is at the center of the
drive reduction model now this model
states that our bodies will strive to
maintain homeostasis psychologists have
suggested that we have what's called a
set point and a set point is an ideal
fixed setting of a physiological system
such as our temperature or even our
respiration
now our brains have the ability to
detect our physiological States and in
turn our brains can activate a feedback
system that helps the body maintain
physiological states at their ideal
setpoint let's take a look at an example
let's say you find yourself in the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan in January without
a hat coat or shoes now that's a very
cold place to be according to the DRI
reduction model what would happen to
your body well first your brain would
detect those changes in your
physiological states most notably
temperature and it would start a cascade
of events that will allow you to try to
increase your temperature for example
you may rub your hands together of your
hands and your arms to warm yourself up
jump up and down or even eventually
begin to shiver so this demonstrates how
our body detects the change in our
temperature and it being outside of the
ideal setpoint and allowed you to do
things to try to raise that temperature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
