ourselves and our families to
populations all over the world but we
can even connect to one of our extinct
relatives Homo sapiens sapiens us to
Homo sapiens neanderthalensis this is a
close but extinct species Neanderthals
evolved outside of Africa and existed
along a geographic range that covered
Europe through parts of the Middle East
and Central Asia and using nothing more
than a DNA sample from Neanderthal bones
that were over 30,000 years old a first
draft of the Neanderthal genome project
was published in may of 2010 since this
report has been published new research
has suggested that Neanderthals and
humans actually interbred with each
other in Mesopotamia a region in the
Middle East about fifty to a hundred
thousand years ago new research
indicates that Neanderthal chromosome
regions were identified in European and
Asian genomes but not in African genomes
which was expected based on the
geographies of Neanderthal fossils
amazingly looking at the essen vs shared
between humans and Neanderthals we can
estimate roughly what percentage of your
genome might be carrying genetic
information that was once part of the
Neanderthal genome so even though
Neanderthals are now extinct they left
relics of themselves in our own genomes
through possible inner breeding and on
the 23 Emmy website they actually have
an ancestry tool to discover what
percentage of your genome has
Neanderthal variation so here I'm
showing you mine I'm about 2.7 percent
neanderthal I'm in the 56th percentile
and they even have a little comparison
here for you to see essentially how
modern humans compared to Neanderthals
now it's important to remember this is
kind of speculative and it's an
estimation based on the current data and
as new data comes in these values may be
reassessed and we may change how we
think about the human in neanderthal
relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
