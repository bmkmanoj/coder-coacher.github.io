announce an element's roll named state
and value not necessarily in that order
by using the right semantic element
we've got roll state and value covered
but we also need to make sure that we're
making an element's name discoverable
this is actually the very first item on
web aims checklist provide text
alternatives for any non-text content at
this point I'm going to take a quick
tangent on terminology we're in the
unfortunate position of having all of
these terms each of which is overloaded
in its own particular way in HTML which
are also used in various contexts to
refer to the same central concept we're
talking about in this lesson since the
way the term label is used in HTML is
closest to what we mean here for the
rest of this course I'm going to refer
to label interchangeably to refer to
this concept but please keep in mind
that in the context of role-name valued
state the name means the same thing that
out of the way let's talk a bit about
labels broadly there are two types of
labels visible labels which are used by
all users to associate meaning with an
element and text alternatives which are
only used when there's no need for a
visual label so here we've got an image
that is self-explanatory to anyone who
can see the image by its very nature a
text alternative is usually not visible
on the page so in this case we can see
this image of be swarming an assistive
technology user would simply have access
to this be swarming label the checklist
provides a list of recommendations for
how to create visible and non visible
labels the easiest is this one form
buttons have a descriptive thought you a
button typically has some text content
and that acts as the buttons text
alternative since this text is visible
to both sighted users an assistive
technology we're lucky because we don't
need to do any more work to create a
good experience for assistive technology
users so that's an easy one to check off
next we need to check that form inputs
have associated text labels when we
create a form input like a checkbox and
just put some text next to it we get a
visual label but we don't actually
create a programmatically accessible
label for the element we're trying to
label
also we don't get the nice behavior
where you can click on the label to
toggle the checkbox we can fix this by
using a label element we can either wrap
at the input element like this or we can
use the for attribute on the label if we
do that we need to make sure to give the
input element and ID and use the same ID
as the value of the for attribute that
creates an association between the label
element and the input element which are
these two methods we use we will get an
accessible label for the check box and
we'll be able to toggle the check box by
clicking the label</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
