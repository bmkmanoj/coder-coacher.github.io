challenging quizzes here but for a
warm-up I think it's very good to
understand the difference between
computability and complexity theory the
first question how fast a computer can
find a way between two points on a map
belongs into complexity theory because
here it's a question of resources so how
fast that is a question about the time
that a computer needs and therefore
investigating this question belongs into
complexity theory asking if a program
can decide if another program is malware
that belongs into computability because
we are not asking about any resources
we're just asking if it's possible in
principle we're asking can a program do
that we're not asking how fast or with
how much memory it can do that in the
third question we are again asking about
resources we're asking about how much
memory and therefore this one belongs
into complexity theory the question
about memory is something we are not
going to look at much in this course
actually I think we're not going to look
at it at all we're going to be concerned
mostly with time how fast a computer can
solve a given problem and toward the end
of this unit we are going to pose the
ultimate resource question and ask what
are the limits of computation in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
