transport layer which sits between the
network layer and the application layer
the key contribution of this layer is
the notion of ports which tells the OS
which process the data is intended for
on a Linux machine you can see this
mapping using lsof dash I having
multiple ports allows more than one
application to receive data from the
network at once something called
multiplexing port numbers are 16 bits
long and many of them are reserved for
special purposes port 80 for instance is
typically the one used for receiving
HTTP requests like a browser would sent
in fact we'll use this as an example
let's say we're running Chrome and that
we visit the Udacity homepage then
chrome will ask the operating system for
a port number that it can use or it will
pick one that has been allocated already
let's say the port number is 55 80 for
its sent then sends the request in a
packet with a source port of 55 804 and
a destination port of 80 when the
Udacity server responds it will send
back a packet whose destination port
matches the one that we sent that way
the OS will know to route the packet to
Chrome and not to some other program it
is important to realize that the
transport layer is really only active at
the endpoints of the route the
intermediate routers on the internet
need only look at the IP address to know
where to forward the packet to so they
never examine the port number control
starts at the application layer moves
through the transport layer and the
network layer and the link layer in the
physical layer at the first node then
for these intermediate steps of course
we need to interpret the signal pull off
any sort of an Ethernet frame or the
like and then look at the IP packet to
figure out where the packet should go
next we never need to look inside the IP
packet at whatever comes in the
transport layer we then forward it and
the same thing happens in the next node
and then only when we receive it do we
need to unpack the transport layer route
it to the correct application and then
let the application interpret the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
