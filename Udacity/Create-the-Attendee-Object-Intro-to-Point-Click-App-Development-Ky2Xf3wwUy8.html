does start with a vowel sound nice okay
I'm data type so this is what it's going
to by default make the name and so I
guess in the case of attendees will have
real names we can just leave it as text
those optional features we can go back
and add them if we need them later okay
it's deployed and actually you might
want to click to launch the new custom
tab wizard okay what would have happened
if what does that do if it's going to
allow us to create a tab automatically
so we can add it into our app just like
how we have the festival town if we
didn't check that box we could just go
create a tab by going through the setup
tree on the left the tab so these guys
up here at home chatter files exactly
okay so safe new custom object tab all
right object attendee tabs style this is
fun this is just like some image that
represents our attendees yep this will
be the image that goes at the top when
we click into the tab it can be random
it really doesn't matter what it is no I
want a good one okay people people right
it's not on okay I know this optional
it's optional and basically just gonna
forget it mad at Sam it's okay yeah
don't fill it out all right this again
is security just leave at default on
that's fine everyone will be able to see
this tab and then this one's actually
important because it's choosing which
apps to add this tab too so we don't
really need to include it and all the
other ones but we want to select the
festival app to add it to our festival
at sea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
