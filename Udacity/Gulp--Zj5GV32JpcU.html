is at home right now hi and today John
is going to help us set up the Gulf
workflow um so how was your weekend John
everyone had a long weekend in the
United States ya know I had a pretty
good fourth of July me and my friends we
went out to Torino and we went to like a
food truck festival which was I just ate
way too much food there's also like a
wing festival and we went to that too
and so I have probably ate like enough
food to survive for the next week so I
guess my diet this week of number it you
know water but it was fun I gambled a
little didn't win big or anything but
came back with more than I left with so
that's always Jarrod oh yeah but it was
fun how was your weekend was very good
was quiet I spent something with my
knees and just sat at home which was
really i know that was i think my
favorite part was when we were like all
done doing the stuff and I got to go sit
back at the hotel for a little bit and
just relax is nice nice to get away and
it's always fun to celebrate the fourth
of July shoveling deep fried food in my
face but today I guess the big thing
we're talking about is gold and so a
couple weeks ago we did a demo about
grunt which is a task runner and sort of
a build tool and gulp is is in the same
vein as that it's here to run
minification concatenation all those
kinds of tasks for you so you can focus
on what's most important and that's sort
of the development of your site as
opposed to the building process of your
site so i guess i set up a little
demonstration today there's a repository
as well which you can find in the
broadcasts section of the discussion
boards it's under the title go up and
setting up a gulf work
flow or something similar to that or
it's just github.com / John you'd ask
the / gulp hyphens start and you can
follow along with that repository if you
want or you know you can reach this
banana Johnny also posted in the
broadcast category yes yes and yeah I
mean you can follow along now or you can
download it and follow along later i'll
also be posting up sort of like a short
guide of all the steps we go through on
the forum so if you just kind of want to
watch now and then go through the guide
later i think that may be the best way
to do it i might go a little fastest on
parts and i think its ease like when i
watch people do demos it's easy for me
to like miss something and I'm like wait
a minute I just got lost and then I'm
spending more time figuring out how to
get back to where they were then
actually listening to them so it might
be best to just like sit listen if you
think of any questions feel free to ask
them but let me start screen sharing
here and we can get started let me just
make sure i'm sharing the right screen
alright there we go so this is my
repository i haven't downloaded already
but just to kind of give you a little
overview of what it looks like there's
an index dot HTML file which has some
stuff going on there's a CSS folder
which has some compiled CSS in there
there's a jeaious folder that has some
javascript in here and there's a style
folder which has a stylist file so
stylist for those of you who aren't
aware is a little bit like less or SAS
it's a precompiled CSS language which
you can use gulp to compile into CSS
which makes it usable by the browser so
we can take a quick peek at this and see
that right it kind of looks like CSS but
the syntax is all a little weird so what
we're going to be using today is we're
going to be using gulp which is known as
the streaming build system to basically
automate our workflow automate a bunch
of these processes that we
we don't want to have to think about
when we're working on our project so I'm
going to take you from installing goal
to setting it up to running a few basic
tasks to setting up maybe some more
advanced asks if we have time so let's
get started so the first thing we
actually need before we begin using goal
is we need to make sure we have node J s
installed on our system installing node
is really easy it works on linux mac
windows all you have to do is you go to
nodejs org and you click this big old
install button right here it'll download
some stuff and then you just run the
executable and it'll set up note on your
system if you have any problem setting
up node feel free to mention that in the
form so I'd be happy to help debug them
but it usually works pretty well an easy
way to check i think is if you do node
hyphen v it should spit out the version
of node in your terminal on mac and
linux on windows i believe it downloads
the node shell which you just open up
and you run all your node commands from
there and hopefully that shouldn't be
broken I think it's easier to break note
on mac and linux than it is on windows
is my text big enough on my my terminal
Gary yep looks good ok cool so once you
have knowed the next step is to navigate
into your so I'm in my my project that I
want to begin you know gulping here and
I need to install go right into setup
gulp on this project so when you install
node you get what's called the node
package manager or NPM and you can use
the command npm install to install just
about any node package available and you
can search for you know node pet the
node packages on the node package
manager but for our case we're using
gold so we're going to use NPM install
save dev Goel
so this is going to take just a second
and we can see that it's doing something
and my dog seems to be very interested
in something come here dog there we go
so it's all installed so now if we look
at our project directory we see we have
these two or sorry this one folder that
was created which is this node modules
folder and if we take a look at what's
inside there we see we have a goal so
basically what that npm command did was
it looked at you know the node servers
it got go it brought that back to my
project it created this node modules
folder and then it's set up go and got
all the necessary files and dependencies
to run gulp on my system in this
particular project folder so now that I
have goal just like with grunt we needed
a grunt file to to basically put all our
code in and run everything here we're
going to do something similar we're
going to make what's called a gulp file
and so we got our gold file so let's
actually open this up and open up our
goal file so we got a whole lot of
nothing in our goal file so let's get
started actually setting up our goal
file so when we did the demo with grunt
grunt we saw was very much like we set
up a big JSON that sort of configured
all of our operations well go kind of
takes a different way of thinking
different philosophy it's a very much a
convention over configuration so we're
actually going to be writing a lot of
JavaScript so we're actually going to
start with vargo equals require both so
what this is doing is this is using
nodes require module which you can kind
of think of as as like an import it's
basically importing this necessary this
necessary file it's looking at the node
modules folder it's pooling end goal and
we're basically just storing it
in this variable gulp to use later and
throughout gulp all we're going to be
doing is we're going to be defining
tasks and so just like grunt there's a
default task we can define and a gulp
task takes two parameters it takes a
name and it also takes and actually let
me make this text a little bit bigger
and it also takes a function or some
sort of call back there's a few other
attributes you can pass into here but
this is the pretty plain and simple sort
of gulp task so let's make our function
actually do something and then we'll see
how to run goal let's just do something
simple for now let's just do a simple
console.log I'm running gulp okay so we
set up our gulp file we've set up this
really simple task so just like with
grunt the way we run gulp is just with
the command gulp and this will run our
default task so by putting this in we're
going to run this default task and we
can see that our console logged out I'm
running gold fantastic so pretty simple
setup you can also you know create
another task and give it a specific name
it can just do another console.log a
robot save it and when we run gulped we
see that it only runs our default task
if I do gulp robot that's going to run
our robot task so we can specify we can
specify what tasks we want go up to run
by just saying gulp and then the task
name if we want to run multiple tasks
say I have another task is just hello
so our hello world in my default Tasker
in it another named task instead of
using a function as my callback I can
actually specify an array of method
names or task names so this is going to
run on when I just use gulp because this
is my default task it's going to look at
this array of callback functions and
it's going to first run my robot task
and then it's going to run my hello task
so let me save this and when I do gulp
we see that it ran my robot task
finished my robot task ran my hello task
and finished my hello task and then it
you know kind of ran these default tasks
which was running these essentially so
that's sort of the basic way of setting
up or just basic tasks single obviously
you're going to want to do a lot more
but this is sort of the the basic
structure of setting up a task that will
run in the terminal with goal so let's
actually figure out now how to you know
do do something a little bit more than
just logging out to the console
obviously I mean you can use gulp to do
that if you want but I mean nobody
nobody really wants to do that you guys
are here because you want to be able to
you know minify files make things look
really nice and make things performant
so let's get rid of everything in my
gold file except for this VAR goal
people's required goal and let's install
some plugins so just like grunt gulp has
a whole directory full of plugins
there's 1532 plugins total and I mean
there's more getting added every day
most of the big ones that you are
probably using in grunt
are probably also been made for gulp so
for example a popular one right it's a
can catch them cat if you want to you
know uglify your files which is
basically minify file our javascript
files you can do that with a go up as
well so you can search for plugins here
and if you click on plugin name it'll
tell you a little bit about that plugin
at the node package managers website
it'll tell you how to install that
plug-in so we would just run this
command in our terminal to install the
plug-in and it also gives you a little
bit of a demo of the usage usually and
then depending on how well it's
documented some of the plugins are not
documented very well so sometimes you
got to go bug the I you know github
owner to like explain some things but
for the most part they're pretty
well-documented just some of them
especially when you start diving into
the really new plugins is when you'll
start finding ones with kind of bad
documentation but the ones we're going
to be using today are pretty well
documented we also see options and any
sort of errors that could be outputted
so let's run this command this npm
install save dev save dev and we're
going to do gulped uglify and we're just
going to give that a little bit of a
second to run all right that runs and
I'm also going to install one more I'm
going to install go rename just because
that's going to come in handy that's
going to let us rename files pretty
easily without having to dive into like
string manipulation and stuff so let's
pop open our gulp file again and let's
include these as well so we're going to
include uglify I can spell and we're
going to include our rename plugins
using
same code as we did to include our gold
file or sorry our goal plugin or module
guess is the right word um rename be so
now we have our glow Phi which will will
use to minify our JavaScript and we also
have our rename which will use to sort
of rename files as we need to so let's
make a new task and let's call this one
scripts and this will be our task which
we use to basically run any sort of
script methods and let's give it a
callback function and in this function
we're going to use we're going to
specify a source file that we want to
act on and the way we do this is we use
our gulp module and we use its source
method so gulp source and then we
specify what we want to look in so
specifically we want to look in the
JavaScript folder and any file that has
javascript so this star is a what's
known as like a catch-all what we've
created here is we've created here in
glob and this glob basically says look
in the jas folder for any file any name
that also includes a dot j/s this is a
little bit like regular expressions but
a little less robust than regular
expressions we can also look for like
any sub directories that may be in there
by using like a double star in a slash
so this basically says look in the jas
folder for any other folders and then
look for files that have the j s suffix
but since we don't have any folders in
there we're just going to do this and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to use a pipe so hope is all about
using the input output stream and a pipe
basically pipes either to or from this
dream you can kind of think of it like
water pipes I guess the source is
basically whatever gets out put it from
this is going to get piped into this
next method so we can chain them
together like this you can you know have
tons of pipes came together like that
but sometimes you might have a lot of
steps so usually it's just easier to add
a new line tab it and then just line it
up like this so we're going to pipe any
of the contents that are gulped source
method finds into our abilify function
so basically anything that ends up
getting picked out from this is going to
get shoved into this method and then
we're going to get some results and
we're going to pipe that into our rename
method and we're going to rename it app
Minjae s and then we're going to pipe
the result of that into a gulp
destination and we're just going to
shove it into our JavaScript folder so
let's go ahead and run this script task
now and see what happens so let's do
goal scripts all right so it finished
running so let's take a look and see
what happens so we see here that we now
have this app Minjae s file which which
has all the minified javascript in from
our apt JS file pretty neat pretty
simple too I think the nice thing about
using this sort of streaming system as
well is with grunt when you use the
configuration file what usually ends up
happening is a lot of temporary folders
get created and that ends up taking a
lot of time whereas with this input
output streaming you're really not
there's no need to create these
temporary folders and everything just
kind of runs a little bit faster
it may not be as noticeable on smaller
projects but as these gulp files and
gruff files get a lot bigger that's when
you start noticing sort of the
performance difference between the two
so that's great let's do the same thing
let's minify our CSS now so usually when
I'm working on a project and I am have
decided like okay I need like a new step
in my build I need to minify my CSS for
example so we have this or is that our
stylist and we also have just our
regular CSS that gets out put it from
that so we need to minify that as well
so let's let's figure out how to do that
so what I would do is I would start by
going to the Gulf j/s plug-in directory
and I would look for maybe a CSS and
let's see what that gives me mmm bunch
of linting things let's try minify and
that search as well mmm I don't think I
want that let's just try minify CSS and
here we go we have gulp minify CSS and
so this is a goal plug-in to minify CSS
using clean CSS so let's uh let's use
this file to to minify our CSS so we're
going to use the same sort of command
npm install save dev gulp minify CSS and
we're going to wait a second for it to
install and there we go so it's
installed it's set up if we look inside
our node modules folder we see that we
have gold minify CSS in there so let's
actually include that in our group file
as well so we're going to minify CSS
equals require gulp f5 CSS and now let's
set up a new cask we're going to call
this our style
task and now we're going to have to
specify a source in this case we're
going to specify our CSS folder we're
not going to do anything with the style
is filed just yet and we're going to
look for anything that has a dot CSS
we're going to pipe that into our minify
CSS function or plugin and we're going
to spit that out to a destination and in
this case we're going to spit it out to
just a min CSS folder alright so let's
run that Gulf styles let it do its thing
and we see we get a min CSS folder and
we get some minified CSS pretty
straightforward I think um and then
let's say we want to run these both
together so one one way we can do this
is we can just say goal scripts styles
and that should run both of them but you
probably don't want to have to remember
all the different names of all the tasks
that you want to run so usually it's a
little easier to specify a default task
or maybe like a like a smaller subset of
general tasks you want to be using that
just take you know scripts giggles down
there the both questions since we're
done anything yeah um can I let me yeah
i'm down to take some questions right
now i think this is a good point to take
some questions loves the beautiful my
screen sorry what was that do you want
to see the questions on your screen and
enter them or do you want me to read
them all uh no yeah I feel free to read
them out okay so Dom asks what happens
if there is more than one j/s file in
the folder
that's a good question so let's take a
look so let's actually add a new file
here and let's pull this app to jas and
let's just put in some filler function
here equals B being mad because I didn't
ok so let's take a look so we have this
app to with some real basic JavaScript
in it let's see what happens when we
women to go up scripts in this case
alright so finished running and in my
apt Minjae s we see that it actually
only minified this new javascript file
the problem with this is it's because
we're not concatenated nice to first so
usually what you want to do in this
process and it was something I was going
to get to later was to concatenate your
files and actually add an extra step
here where you concatenate them using a
concatenation plug-in and then pipe them
into the minification process and then
set them as a destination as you can see
here when we ran this it just ran it on
the single JS file instead of grabbing
all of them inside this folder again
yeah so in this case there's an
Orchestrator error and cat how because
it's mad catz not to find yeah so
usually it's best to concatenate your
javascript files or you need to output
them all to a different name so this is
a case where using this rename function
wouldn't be a good idea because i'm
basically renaming all of my files to
this app Minjae s and spitting them all
out to here
because it's doing one at a time it does
this one first spits it out to here does
this one second and it overwrites
everything in here with that so usually
you should concatenate them or specify
you know use some tricky stuff here to
specify sort of like an iterative name
there's a few things you can do and we
can talk about those in a little bit
okay thanks down one so Tim asked how
would you go about editing original
documents if you have already ran them
through a task or does it keep the
original copy in the same folder yeah
good question um so typically this
actually might be a good chance let me
show you guys a little bit better
structure so this is where structuring
your project is really important so
here's just a little project that I've
been working on and so it's important to
structure your project really cleanly so
here I actually have two folders i have
an app and a public and inside my public
folder actually pretty much all my sort
of minified code whereas in my app
folder i have basically anything that
i'm working on another easy structure to
set up is just to do let me just make
like a simple test folder here is to
actually separate a source and
distribution folder and in your
distribution folder that's where you're
actually going to be sort of piping all
of your outputted minute the source code
so hopefully you won't have to go about
editing the minified files because
nobody wants to go through right and
try and edit this you're not going to be
able to find anything it's going to be
much easier to just be able to go back
and edit this and output the results of
the minification process to either a new
folder or file and it's easiest to
organize them as the source directory or
the / development directory which is you
know where you're doing all of your work
and then using gulp or grunt to build to
a distribution directory where you'll
have basically all your production ready
code alright thanks John and thank them
for the question so Robert asks what the
hyphen hyphen save dev for ya so let's
uh let me go back here so typically in
node projects I didn't do it this time
but you should always include a
package.json file you can set one up
pretty quickly using the command npm in
it and it'll take you through this sort
of little step through guide and you'll
see that it makes this package.json file
so let me actually open that up and show
you what's in there so this package.json
file tracks all of our dependencies
there's developer dependencies and then
regular dependencies when you do save
dead it should throw them inside the
developer dependencies it didn't because
I did this after the fact but developer
dependencies are modules and plugins
that you as a developer are going to be
using that is the public version of your
site isn't going to rely on these
modules or plugins or frameworks or
whatever standard dependencies are going
to be things like if you include angular
in your project in your site depends on
angular developer dependency is like I
said are
only going to be things that you use in
the development process or someone on a
team or as forking your project should
also be using in their development
process because you've included say like
a gold file or certain Bower components
and things like that that's what the
saved dev does if you want to save just
to your dependencies you can do npm
install double hyphen save and that will
save them to your projects dependencies
so again dependencies are basically
things that are required for your app to
run developer dependencies are things
that are probably best to install if you
plan on developing on that project as
well alright thanks John and thanks
Robert um very question even asked rare
and how this get fit with all of this
yeah so get and gulp are two very very
different things get is strictly for
version control you're going to be using
it to basically track the progress of
your project and you know sort of track
iterations throughout your project if
you can kind of think of it right as
like you're saving points in time at
where your projects at whereas gulp is
largely going to be used for minifying
and getting code ready for production
often times these things kind of come
hand-in-hand and as you can see there's
a lot of sort of get plugins let's see
get or I think there should be some get
plugins save go get now swear there were
some get plugin because I've used them
before well maybe it's just not
filtering right right now
yeah why didn't it find this there's so
there's a gulp get plugin which you can
use to actually automate a lot of your
sort of get processes so say you only
ever minify your code when it's at a
point that's ready to be committed and
you maybe just want to automate that
commit process well they have sort of
some some definitions here for how you
can write tasks that do commits they
also have how you can sort of add files
so you can I guess use gulp to automate
your get processes but ultimately the
the reason you're using git and the
reason you're using gulp are are
different get is strictly for tracking
the progress of your project and github
is for hosting it online whereas gulp is
for getting your code production ready
and automating sort of all of these
kinds of workflows that you'll be doing
from minifying concatenating to
compiling things like stylist sass
CoffeeScript to watching files for
changes and things like that ok thank
you a couple of more questions Johnny
Michael asked if you concatenated the
files and I guess mr. for needed the
comcast com ok I wouldn't try to also
include abdomen jf yeah you're actually
right and that's because I'm throwing it
in the same folder which is why there's
usually it's a good idea to have
separate folders I did not structure
this demo project very well so it would
try to include the abdomen jas but you
can use globs to ignore files as well I
believe let's see here there's a way to
exclude things using I think it's like a
double minus sign in the gloss
Bob it's been a while since I've had to
try and do something like that but yeah
you're right it would totally try to
include the happened at jas which is why
later we would be putting it we would be
putting that file somewhere else inside
our distribution directory for example
questions keep coming done oh that's
fine I'm totally fine with just
answering James ask any chance there is
an unmodified plugin for working on
someone else's production code favorite
Vera defect or something we don't
necessarily have the source cool so
actually you can do that right in google
developer tools and actually there are
unmans as well ok game but if you look
in the developer tools if you go to say
the sources I see if I can find
something some mess of stuff here and
you actually click on this little pair
of brackets at the bottom here it pretty
prints it the only thing it won't do
that still a problem is during the
minification process it replaces
variable names with a single letters to
save bytes so as you can see here we
have like a and you can see it all over
the place a a or OA there's no real way
to sort of unofficial bahria believes if
you don't have the the source maps they
used so you would either need to have a
copy of their source Maps or or just
have to deal with all the you know kind
of single letter variable names and kind
of figure out what they're used for
there isn't a great way to unman I
source code to the original work unless
you have the the source maps like
said all right I'm showing well the next
one is from Jeff Wow will this be
recorded and available for viewing later
if so where can I find it mr. Glenn
podcast Jeff yes if you go in your
community and in the event just dyed
blonde or go the recordings will show up
and as you can see on John screen he's
going through the broadcast category
where we also boasted the transcript
along with the video um I think that
should help you let us know if you have
any troubles and we'll make sure you we
link you to the video thank you yeah
more questions arvind asked is there a
way to run these in the background you
don't need to run the desks manually
especially while using copy for games
and such yeah and actually that was one
of the things i was going to hit on
which is watch tasks so this is now i
guess a good time to do this so dope
just like grunt lets you watch files for
changes so suppose i want to you know
work on my javascript and you know or my
CSS or something and not have to worry
about you know okay i made a bunch of
changes let's compile my code I just
want it to compile every time I make a
change so what i can do is i can create
what are called watch tasks and so the
way we structure a watch task so it used
to be really kind of a pain in the butt
until got updated and then they've just
sort of included their own watch
functionality so now you can just say
gold watch and again you specify what
directories you want to watch and you
specify a callback function so it works
very similar
to a task so there's just you know the
files you want to watch and then what's
tasks or scripts you want to execute
when that file gets to changes get
detected in that file so in this case we
would want to run scripts for my CSS if
you know anything in my CSS changes then
I probably want to run my Styles task so
let's see what this looks like I'm going
to add this to my default and so here we
go so we see that it runs my scripts it
runs my styles and then it runs this
watch task and we can see that it's just
waiting where as before when we ran our
gulp task it just you know finished and
then it was done now it's actually sort
of idling here waiting for something to
happen so let's take a look and see what
happens when we change something in our
CSS so let's make this red and say if we
can see you over here in my terminal
that my Styles task ran again so in case
you missed that I'm going to make a
change one more time and watch here and
you'll see something change so let's
make our you know padding maybe 20 pics
save and we can see that again our
Styles task ran so that's basically how
you sort of automate a lot of these
processes is by setting up a watch task
and this becomes extremely useful when
you're developing so you don't have to
keep you know jumping over to your
terminal and saying like blah blah blah
blah blah you can just go in work on
your CSS know that the code is compiling
you're able to you know open up your
your project and examine it and watch
for changes it's really helpful being
able to do that and then usually if like
a lot of people usually have a question
like okay how do I stop watching in the
terminal
if you use ctrl C that's just sort of
like the kill task and that'll take you
back to just sort of the normal terminal
one thing that may happen and I don't
know if they actually updated this since
then was sometimes if you include a
syntax error it'll stop watching so you
can there's a few different methods you
can use to just throw the error but not
to stop watching the one I suggest is
you use a plumber I believe is what it's
called go plumber and this basically
prevents the pipe from breaking when
errors occur this way when say maybe you
do type an error here it'll spit the
error out to you but it won't kill the
stream so in this case because i'm not
using plumber when it through this error
it just blasted out this glob of
problems and then it stopped the watch
task and now I'd have to go in here fix
this and then you know run gulp again
using plumber is definitely the right
thing to be doing to make sure that
you're still receiving the errors but
it's not wrecking your build process all
right plastic questions done um so James
ask you mentioned earlier then go forth
festa max in one else's is there a
particular version of limits which you
would fade best works with um I don't
think I maybe accidentally said that but
it also works good on Windows just with
Windows you have to use the node shell
as opposed to just being able to use
like the command prompt without I mean
you can use the command prompt or
PowerShell but you're going to have to
do some some minor modifications and
tweaking and stuff like that essentially
setting up node in your your path
environment variable
as far as versions of Linux which it
works best with um I don't think there's
a version of Linux that it necessarily
works best in I think node so go right
is just a module for node so any Linux
platform that node works fine and gulp
is going to work fine in and I think
node works in just about any Linux
environment I've ever encountered so you
shouldn't have any problem there if you
do they'll let me know i'd love to hear
if there's a linux platform you're using
where we're note or gulp isn't working
properly you know i'm not sure i'm finin
right but she asks how do you handle get
for your source code built goat or even
gh-pages for one project if the femina
single repo ahran differently those uh
so yeah I keep them all in the same repo
there's a few common patterns out there
and this is actually something I I know
a lot of students have been interested
in and I kind of want to do a write-up
about but usually what i have is i have
my master branch and then I usually set
up two more branches the development
branch oh but not a valid object named
master oh I don't I don't think it will
let me do that until I add this stuff
and then I also make you know my
gh-pages branch as far as like my source
and distribution code it all I mean it
all lives on the master branch for my g
eight pages I usually only keep my my
build a code on there on my gh-pages one
because that's the code that is going to
be running on my github pages site so
usually you can specify you know what
files get merged into that branch and
you can take them out as well and then
for my development branch that's pretty
much a mirror of my master branch and
that's where I do all my development and
then when I'm ready to push changes i'll
push changes from my development branch
to my master branch and then from my
master branch I'll merge any changes
into my github pages branch and specify
that I only want to merge over my
production-ready code that's getting a
little out of scope of gulp but that's
sort of the process I would take you can
also like I say views golpa get to set
up the process for doing that so all you
have to do instead of having to do you
know get add you can just say gulp build
and maybe that'll run through all these
tasks and add the proper files and
commit the changes and push them to the
right repository and branch but that's
kind of how I set it up so I do pretty
much all my work on a development branch
push any changes from the development
branch to the master and then merge any
needed changes from the master to the
github pages branch all right questions
commitments so out at you just more
common in your transcript could you
please list all the helpful
most reliable both plugins especially
for image optimization yeah I can I I
think I include us quite a few of them I
also share like a gulp file that I use
yeah i'll make sure to include those
links as well so yeah i'll make sure to
include those hey thanks John and thanks
al well you're going to love answering
this alone haha consider Gulf better
than run assuming they serve the thing
focus uh so this is a very opinionated
answer but but yes I really like the the
speed of gulp I like the way it utilizes
node more than the one a grunt does I
like the fact that i feel like i'm
writing in javascript as opposed to
writing a big configuration file however
I will say grunt is very straightforward
and very easy it's easy to get someone
started on grunt whereas with gulp
usually to get it to be a little bit
more masterful of it you have to have a
little bit of understanding of things
like JavaScript promises the input
output stream and those are a little bit
more difficult to learn than just hears
grunt here are the plugins for grunt
here's the configuration file you write
go to really like dive into to gulp and
get the full like full power out of it
you do need to know some JavaScript
really but in terms of being better than
grunt I think it is alright um while ass
when watching is there a way to have the
browser reload when a file is changed
yeah yeah and that's something that will
include in my write-up as well because I
don't think we have enough time to dive
into it today but you can use I believe
it's called
rouser sink sink okay bull browser
there's a great write-up on the browser
sinks website on how to use gulp j/s
with browser sink and you can do that
there's also I think gulp live reload
yeah built plugin for live reload so you
can use it there's a lot of different
options and then basically all you do is
you set one of the tasks in your watch
function say for example I set up you
know a browser sync task then here when
there's a change it'll run my script
code and compile and then it'll also run
you know my live reload or something
like that so that's kind of what you
would do there and then that way you can
just you know have your index.html open
obviously this isn't going to work but
you'd be able to you know watch for
changes here instead of having to
continually refresh alright thanks John
and thanks while you said the question
none Michael asks how would you
integrate testing with frameworks like
jasmine there you go you're on it um
yeah so just like grunt gulp like if if
there's something you want to be able to
do say testing get minification just
setting up production servers anything
go does go pass plugins that do that
more often than not so in this case with
your specific question you're interested
in integrating tests with a framework
like jasmine I simply just looked for
goal jasmine and sure enough there's a
goal plug-in that will run Jasmine tests
for you you can you know set up a task
you can specify you know what tests you
want to run and you can pipe in jazz the
Jasmine method this one's pretty well
documented it's created by Sandra Soros
who's a pretty pretty popular famous
JavaScript developer you're not familiar
with him he's created quite a bit as you
can see here but there's most more often
than not there's going to be a plugin
for the task at hand so I would say just
just read into it a little bit add this
one's very well documented so it should
be pretty easy to figure out but almost
anything that you normally have to
manually do while developing code a tool
like grunt or gulp is going to allow you
to automate that and it's really really
great to sort of have these tools just
because it sucks having to do this stuff
manually all the time it takes you out
of the build process to have to you know
stop open up your terminal run run your
tests or stop open up your terminal run
some minification program or you know
open up your index.html and have to
refresh open up your app and have to hit
refresh just having go handle all that
stuff for you is just going to make your
life as a developer so much better
there's also a lot of sort of
pre-written gulp files out there if you
check out a scaffolding tool such as
like yo men or if you clone someone
else's repository for a project
typically they already have sort of a
build process set up and you can just go
about using their build process to work
on their project or you like I said you
can use yeoman to use a generator that
sort of sets all this up for you but I'd
say for the first couple times you're
you know using this tool and kind of
understanding how it works and
understanding what some of these
processes and workflows are
it's best to just kind of start doing
yourself writing your build tool by hand
a couple times again will you know two
or three projects because you'll learn
so much and it'll be that much easier to
dive into somebody else's project and
look at what they're doing and say oh
okay I see that he is you know minifying
the code in this file and running it
through this optimization process okay
so it's definitely a good idea to sort
of try these things out for yourself and
you know trying out gulp jasmine is a
great place to start Thanks well thanks
Michael you think you so much done we're
almost out of dying Oh any parting
thoughts John uh just that if it can be
a little intimidating to get started on
on a build tool like goal for grunt and
I totally understand that there's
certainly a little different than some
of the the work that you're probably
going to be doing there you know kind of
doing a lot of the boring stuff that
we'd rather not be doing but are kind of
important but the grand scheme of things
is just going to make your life so much
easier using one of these tools and it's
good to get started now when you're
already sort of absorbing all this
material and you can kind of begin
including small steps of this into your
workflow by no means should you try to
like you know right you know your whole
workflow now I would say you know maybe
for the next project to work on maybe
just try getting globe set up with it
and have it minify your files and that's
it from there just worry about building
the project and then as you think about
more things you want to be able to do
with goal try integrating those
processes and pieces one step at a time
so like I said you know for example
maybe one project just minify code maybe
the next project you include live
reloading maybe the next project you
include some image optimization there's
fine
no means no hurry to really learn these
but there I'd say every developer I know
uses them so it's important to know them
eventually as a front-end developer
great goodness get started right now
with easy steps though mm-hmm definitely
okay well that's all we had hope this
was helpful John will be putting up the
transcript on the broadcast category and
we'll see you next week in a webcast
yeah we'll let you know what it will be
about done and then you have some
talking to do yes yes we can figure out
what to do next week ah the the right up
to will be up and probably about 2015 20
minutes so so you can feel free to go to
again the the broadcast channel of the
discussion boards for the front-end
nanodegree and you should be able to
find it there I just have a few more
things that I gotta throw in there and
yeah that's pretty much it well alright
thank you yeah thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
