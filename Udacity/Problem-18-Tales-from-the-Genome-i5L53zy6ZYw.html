take each individual single-stranded DNA
sequence and imagine that it was
double-stranded now if you want to do
this the hard way you can actually write
in above the sequence or below what the
complementary sequence would be and then
you could actually count up all the
letters and then try to do the math but
for me the easier way to do this is to
take the 10 letters and actually count
how many T's we have we have 2 t's here
and we also count the number of A's or
adding 1 to 3 we have 3 a's remember
that for every a you see in this string
here we're actually going to have a tea
in the other complementary strand see 1
2 3 t's so just by counting the number
of A's and tease I've got the total
number of T's I would have in the
double-stranded molecule 5 and just
remember that I double the number of
letters here from 10 to 20 so 5 out of
20 is one-fourth or twenty-five percent
do the same thing for the second one so
t.t.t.t that's 40s and 2 a's that six
total 6 out of 20 is the same thing as 3
out of 10 or 30 percent for the next 1
i've got 1 2 3 3 a's and T's total three
out of 20 letters total would be fifteen
percent and then we've got one two three
four five six seven eight nine nine a's
and tease out of 20 which would be
approximately or exactly forty five
percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
