important and come up a lot are planar
graphs these are graphs that can be
drawn in the plane on a flat piece of
paper so that the edges don't cross so
here's an example of a planar graph
we've got one two three four five nodes
and one two three four five edges and
you see the way I drew it here this node
here and this no needed to be connected
and I just drew a nice little curvy line
around without crossing anything else so
this is a planar graph it still would be
a planar graph even if I drew it with a
crossing in it because the issue is that
there's some way to do it so the edges
don't cross now in this particular
example we've got five nodes and five
edges but what we're interested in and
what is the relationship in general
between the number of nodes in a planar
graph and the number of edges this is a
more complicated example than any of the
ones we looked at before in this unit
there is some kind of a relationship and
there's constraints by virtue of the
fact that the graph is drawn in the
plane let's take a look at that let's
think about adding some edges here we
can add that edge can add this edge we
can add this edge we can add this edge
and are there any more edges we can add
while still being able to draw it in a
plane it doesn't look that way right
this node is connected to well all the
other no this one's done this node is
connected to one two three other nodes
but it can't reach this one it seems
like it's sort of all blocked out that's
going to be true in general there's
gonna be some graphs that can't be drawn
as a planar graph so if we add this edge
between this node and this node the
resulting graph is no longer planar so
how many edges did we get here all told
we've got one two three four five six
seven eight nine and at least in this
example the number of edges seems to
need to be less than or equal to nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
