camera can do for us let's see how to
create manipulate and apply one in this
demo we've got a game world with a huge
star a tiny planet and an itty bitty
satellite let's see what this looks like
without using a camera using the default
camera we can just barely see the edge
of the star we can see just half the
planet and we can't even see the
satellite it's actually right here but
it's so small it's not even one pixel
wide so let's use an orthographic camera
to zoom in on each one of these objects
in turn so what is a camera well a
camera holds on to two matrices one
matrix encodes the camera's position and
orientation in the game world for 2d
games this is usually just a simple XY
pair but for 3d games say a three-d
flight simulator the camera can hold the
plans 3d position its pitch its role and
it's yell the other matrix encodes how
the camera translates positions in the
world into positions on the screen this
includes how much perspective to include
that's fisheye lens versus telephoto
lens and how big an area on the screen
the camera will ultimately draw to to
use a camera we first need to declare
and initialize it then there are two
things we have to do down in the render
call back the first is calling camera
update whenever we adjust the properties
of a camera like its position it needs
to fold those changes into the matrices
that define how it looks at the world
the easy way to ensure this happens is
just a call update each frame it's a
fast operation so no worries the second
thing we need to do is to tell our shape
renderer that we want to use our camera
we do this by setting the shape
renderers projection matrix to the
cameras combined matrix the combined
matrix is the combination of the cameras
view and projection matrices yeah
there's a lot of matrices flying around
basically shape renderer doesn't have a
notion of position in some larger world
so all it's got is a projection matrix
one more thing is we need to handle
screen resizing correctly the resized
callback gets called right after create
and any time the screen size changes
which could be because a mobile device
rotated or because we're running the
desktop app and user is changing the
window size by dragging around the
corner when the screen size changes we
need to make sure our camera is up
dated if the camera thinks that the
screen is smaller than it really is
shapes will be way bigger than we want
them to be and vice versa this call set
to ortho updates the camera with the new
screen size the first argument is
whether an increasing value of y should
mean going down the screen and we don't
want that to be true all right let's see
what code it'll take in order to get the
camera to zoom in on each of these
objects in turn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
