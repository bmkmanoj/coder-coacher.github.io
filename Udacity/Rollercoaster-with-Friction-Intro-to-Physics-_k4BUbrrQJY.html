this problem is by first thinking about
what we have and what we have is
potential energy and I'm going to call
that the initial potential energy since
what we're going to need will require
both some potential energy final and
some kinetic energy
now hopefully what we have is greater
than what we need because we're going to
lose some energy when we go over this
area with friction so if I think about
this in terms of energy final energy
would just be whatever my initial energy
is minus how much I lose here the amount
of energy I lose well that would just be
the work done by friction so how much
energy is lost well I can rewrite this
equation like this okay
fair enough we need the initial energy
in the final energy and then we can
convert that to some sort of work and we
should know the maximum force not bad
well the initial energy that's just the
potential energy the final energy is our
final potential energy and remember this
is now a height of 2 R so this is an
expression for my energy lost I can plug
in my known values from up here and I
find that the energy lost is equal to 40
thousand joules and how is the energy
getting lost
well friction is doing work let's take a
look at a force diagram for the car
we've got our standard weight in normal
force and since the car is moving to the
right friction is pointing to the left
and note that this is exactly parallel
though in the opposite direction as the
direction of motion so we can use our
equation work equals F parallel times
distance and I get an answer of two
thousand new ones now you may have also
called this negative I was being a
little sloppy here with what I should
call negative and positive so we
accepted either positive or negative two
thousand Newtons for the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
