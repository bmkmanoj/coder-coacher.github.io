all of the entries in the each row so
for example in this room I added up
these numbers divided by 5 and that gave
me a result of 4.00 here 9.00 here and
16.0 two or I've rounded here for this
last one now look at this data isn't
this beautiful 149 16-point 02 though
well that point 02 is sort of a bummer
but let's pretend it was just 16 for a
second and see if there's any pattern
well 14 9 16 I do see a pattern there
these are squares one unit 1 unit of
time squared is 1 2 squared is 4 3
squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16 that's
an incredible pattern it seems like
there may be some relationship between
distance and the square of time but the
16-point 02 is really bumming me out
does it really mean that this pattern is
false well not necessarily because one
thing we forgotten to do so far is
calculate error in the previous unit we
talked about how to calculate the error
of a single measurement maybe that
measurement was measuring the length of
the shadow of something but now we have
multiple measurements we have five
measurements for each of these
calculated values how do we calculate
the error associated with multiple
measurements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
