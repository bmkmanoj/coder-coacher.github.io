there if I had more than d images ok so
decent thousand ten thousand dimension
let's say or a million so if I had you
know ten thousand images and i was
looking at all those i could get 10,000
I ghen vectors but clearly the sum of
those outer products if I've only got a
small number right the whole idea is
that M is going to be a lot less than D
so how many of them are there well your
intuition might say well I've got em
independent things so there must be M of
them but actually your intuition was
wrong and in fact a better intuition
will be the following those are give you
two points in three dimensions ok how
many vectors can span those just one
right well I go between them and the
reason is I have to think about
subtracting off the mean right and once
i subtract off the mean actually i only
have one degree of freedom right because
the origin is going to be halfway
between those two points so once you
tell me where one of the points is I
know where the other one is so there's
only one degree of freedom so with two
points there's only one possible
eigenvector let's think about it this
way if I have three points in space ok
how many vectors does it take to span
those points well they lie in a plane
don't they of course they do three
points to finds a triangle so with three
points there's only two eigenvectors in
general there are M minus 1 eigen
vectors and the reason there's n minus 1
is I take my endpoints and i subtract
out the mean so that removes a degree of
freedom so that's a trick question that
I always give on the final of my course
so if anybody is taking the final now
you know the answer ok there's m minus 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
