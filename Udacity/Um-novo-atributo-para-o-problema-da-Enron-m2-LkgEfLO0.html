new feature specifically I'll be adding
some features for the Enron data set and
walking you through how you can figure
out whether you're moving in the right
direction here's a process I usually
follow when coding up a new feature the
first thing is to start with your human
intuition what feature do you think
might contain some pattern that you can
exploit using machine learning an
example of a human intuition I might
have on the Enron data set is that
persons of interest might have
particularly strong email connections
between each other in other words they
send each other emails at a higher rate
than then people in the in the
population at large send emails to
persons of interest the next thing to do
is actually code up the feature this is
what you'll do next in a quiz after that
visualization will tell you if you're on
the right track does your new feature
give you discriminating power in the
classification problem you're trying to
solve and then presumably through this
process you've learned something new if
for no other reason than because you
have this new feature available to you
and very often you'll repeat this
process a few times as you zero in on
what you think will be the most helpful
new feature for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
