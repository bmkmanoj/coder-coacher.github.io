solanas screens it's looking pretty
slick oh well it wasn't just me we that
hard at work do you want to look at the
wireframes yeah sure let's review what
we've done in version 0.2 the app you
made the fundamental screens of shopping
list plus plus this included the main
screen with all the lists also known as
the shopping list fragment and the
shopping list detail screen also known
as the active list details activity in
order to do this you needed to master
reading and writing data you also
learned about the firebase UI library
which helps you easily show up to date
firebase data in a listview at this
point you've got an app that can be
edited by a bunch of users
simultaneously which can add lists
rename them and delete them inside of
those lists we've also got items that
Eddie user could add and on your own I'm
going to have you work on the edit and
delete functionality for those items if
you users work well together is a pre
useful app well JP that's actually why
you're here take a look Wow do humans
even eat those I don't know seems that
we have a troll in our midst well have
you considered another option maybe it's
something from outside your group of
roommates anyone you totally think too
but I haven't shared the code with
anyone unless you you who have you been
talking to you're under nondisclosure
agreement was it grocery grabber how
much do they pay you how much you know
another way to solve this is to
implement user authentication of
firebase with user authentication you
can share accounts you can create lists
and add items to lists interesting it's
actually not a bad idea yeah and
firebase user authentication is really
pretty easy hmm ok well I better read up
on user authentication but I'll see you
both inversion point through the app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
