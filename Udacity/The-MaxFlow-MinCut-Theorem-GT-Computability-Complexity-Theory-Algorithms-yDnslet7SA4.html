from A to B must be saturated and then
the backwards edge from B to a must be
unused before going any further let's
illustrate this with an example here we
have a flow on the left and the
corresponding residual graph on the
right note that there is no path from s
to T in the residual graph let's mark
the vertices we can reach from s in
green and the other ones in orange now
it's easy to see that all the edges from
the green to the orange vertices are
saturated and the edges from the orange
to the green are empty just like the
theorem claims recall that for any cut
the value of a flow is the flow out of
the partition with the source minus the
flow into the partition with the source
as we just argued however in this case
there is no flow back into the source
partition
moreover the flow saturates all the
edges so it's just the sum of the
capacities across the cut from A to B
which is then defined as the cut
capacity that completes the second part
of the theorem lastly we need to show
that the existence of a cut that has the
same value as a flow implies that that
flow is a maximum flow this follows
immediately from the fact that a cut is
an upper bound if it's not an upper
bound then cut capacity wouldn't be an
upper bound on the value of the flow so
this would produce a contradiction that
then completes the theorem these three
things are equivalent maximum flow is
equal to minimum capacity cut and the
ford-fulkerson approach returns a
maximum flow if you followed all that
congratulations the max low min cut
theorem is one of the classic theorems
in the study of algorithms and a
wonderful illustration of duality which
we'll discuss in a later lesson for now
however we're not quite ready to leave
maximum flow yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
