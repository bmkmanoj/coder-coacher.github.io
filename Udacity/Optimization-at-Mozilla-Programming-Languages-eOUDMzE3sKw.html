can since I introduce our students very
briefly to optimization at the
JavaScript ast level we might replace a
subtree like x times one with just X if
we believe that that preserves semantics
I was wondering if you could just give
me a hint without telling me any trade
secrets about higher level optimizations
that are important what's the next step
after replacing sub trees so in our
JavaScript engine we've recently had a
great boost from type inference
javascript is a variously called untie
for dynamically typed language and it's
important not to burden programmers with
writing down type declarations like in
Java that was never in the scope of
JavaScript and rightly so but the
underlying runtime the the just-in-time
compiling javascript engine has to know
the types to get very concrete and use
the hardware well so we have a very
adaptive sort of online type inference
algorithm it can study the code and then
try to infer types and if some codes
gets loaded or eval it can change its
mind your can conserve what it's good
and throw away what was invalidated
that's very important for performance
there are the traditional sort of loop
invariant code motion optimizations that
we're getting into more and more because
people are writing JavaScript that looks
more like see or even portrait in the
old days you're seeing more graphics
code we see more numerical processing
thank you for taking the time to tell us
about it sure my pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
