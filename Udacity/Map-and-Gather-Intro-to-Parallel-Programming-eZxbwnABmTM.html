of communication the different patterns
of communication you'll see in parallel
computing and as you'll see this is
really all about how to map tasks and
memory together how to map tasks which
are threads in CUDA and the memory that
they're communicating through so the
communication pattern you've already
seen is called map now with map you've
got many data elements such as elements
of an array or entries in a matrix or
pixels in an image and you're going to
do the same function or computational
task on each piece of data this means
each task is going to read from and
write to a specific place in memory
there's a one-to-one correspondence
between input and output so map is very
efficient on GPUs and it's easily
expressed in an efficient way in CUDA by
simply having one thread to each task
but this isn't a very flexible framework
there's many things you can't do with a
simple map operation I suppose that you
want each thread to compute and store
the average across a range of data
elements say maybe we want to average
each set of three elements together in
this case each thread is going to read
the values from three locations in
memory and write them into a single
place and so on or suppose you want to
blur an image by setting each pixel to
the average of its neighboring pixels so
that this pixel would average together
the values of all five of these pixels
and then let's take this pixel next to
it would have work together the values
of all these pixels and so on we'll do
exactly this kind of blurring operation
in the homework assignment that's coming
up at the end of this lecture this
operation is called a gather because
each calculation gathers input data
elements together from different places
to compute an output result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
