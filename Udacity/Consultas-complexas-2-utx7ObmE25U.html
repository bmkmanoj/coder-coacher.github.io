are some functions that usually exist in
query languages like sequel such as
group bys and aggregate functions so
let's say that I wanted to create some
transformed version of my data for
example what are the total number of
enrollments per district I could write
something like this
select district some odd are generated
from odd hard data group by district
let's talk about this a little bit more
what's happening exactly some is what we
call an aggregate function an aggregate
function takes some set of values
usually numbers and performs a
mathematical operation on them we've
used some but other aggregate functions
include count min Mean Max you get the
idea operations that one could perform
on a collection of numbers but wait
every single row is only one number so
how do we get to collections of numbers
well we basically say here is take each
distinct district and then for all the
different values of odd hard generated
corresponding to a row for that district
sum them up so we start with our odd
hard data table take each district and
sum up the count of Aadhaar generated
now in order for our results to make
sense we're only going to want one row
in our output for each district so we
throw in this group by clause on the end
which essentially says let's only have
one row per district in our results
there can be numerous clauses in a group
by so we could also say this select
district subdistrict some odd heart
generated from odd hard data group by
district sub districts note that
whatever columns we select that we don't
aggregate we need to group by in this
case district and sub district we could
also put a where clause here so in order
to sum up Aadhaar generated for people
over 60 in each district I can just add
a where clause in after the table name
as we discussed earlier if we were to
run this query giving us select district
sub-district some-odd heart generated
from odd hard data where age greater
than 60 group by district subdistrict
if we were to run this query we would
have a row for every combination of
district and subdistrict and we would
also have for each row account of how
many odd har were generated for people
over the age of 60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
