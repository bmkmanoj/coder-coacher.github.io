particular hedge fund they want to know
what are the goals for the hedge fund
and they'll also want to know the
results of certain metrics let's take a
look at goals first now you might say of
course my goal is to make money well
it's a little bit finer than that or a
little bit more subtle than that there
of course other potential goals but
these two are the primary types of goals
that hedge funds go after one type is to
beat a benchmark what does that mean
let's suppose for instance that you've
got a strategy that looks at the stocks
that are in the S&amp;amp;P 500 there's 500 of
them of course and you're especially
smart at picking out the good ones so
you might build a hedge fund whose goal
is to beat the S&amp;amp;P 500 index as a
benchmark because you're wise it's
selecting among all those which stocks
are going to outperform and of course
the overall index has the good stocks
and the bad stocks so you're going to do
better because you picked the specific
good ones an important component of the
beat of benchmark model is that many
benchmarks like the stock market as a
whole for which S&amp;amp;P 500 is a good
representative go down and it is of
course natural that a portfolio
consisted of stocks from this index
might go down as well so even though
both the index and the fund go down you
can outperform the index by going down
less so this kind of fund that is tagged
against the benchmark can still meet
performance goals if it goes down so
long as that index is going down more
that brings us to absolute return funds
their goal is to provide positive return
no matter what these funds are usually
long short which means they make
positive bets and stocks they think are
going to go up and they make negative
bets and stocks they're going to go down
well
about shorting a little bit later in any
case their objective is to make slow
gradual positive return no matter what
often these types of funds don't make
the same percentage gains as the betta
benchmark fund but they have very low
draw downs in other words when the
market takes a big hit they often don't
the next question is well how do we
measure how well that fund is meeting
those goals we talked about these
metrics in the mini course manipulating
financial data in Python but we'll
repeat it just a little bit here to
remind you and also to bring those folks
up to speed who didn't necessarily have
that previous course cumulative return
is a measure of you know given the
amount of funds I started with how much
more did I end up with after a certain
period of time so suppose we have an MD
array of values of our portfolio where 0
is the first value and -1 is the very
last one we can easily compute
cumulative return by dividing that last
value by the first value and subtracting
1 so for instance if we made 20% over a
year this would end up being zero point
two volatility is a measure of how
rapidly and aggressively the portfolio
goes up and down in value and of course
lower volatility is better volatility is
simply measured as the standard
deviation of daily returns our last
factor here which is a measure of the
ratio of risk to reward is typically
measured using Sharpe ratio and the
Sharpe ratio is calculated like this
Sharpe ratio is also sometimes called
risk adjusted reward so you can consider
that to be reward divided by risk our
reward is our average daily return minus
the risk-free rate and our risk is
simply a measure of that standard
deviation of daily returns or volatility
we multiply that ratio by the square
root of 252 that is how many trading
days there are in a year and remember
we're always working with daily returns
so that's why we use this 252 number so
recapping hedge funds have goals
typically either to beat a particular
benchmark or to gain absolute return and
then metrics by which we judge how well
they accomplish those goals so
cumulative return how much did they make
over a period of time volatility how
volatile were they over that time and
then risk adjusted reward or Sharpe
ratio one thing I want to mention before
I leave this topic with regard to
benchmarks is the benchmark you choose
should depend on the expertise you have
so let's suppose you're an expert in
Eastern Europe and you're great at
picking stocks in emerging markets in
Eastern Europe you should select some
benchmark that represents that similar
kind of investing and there are indexes
that represent emerging markets in
Eastern Europe there are also other
funds whose values you might use as a
benchmark or let's say your expertise is
in banks you might choose an index for
the baking is industry and show that you
can beat that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
