monolith the secure model F secures
access to the monolith container using
engine X which will serve as the reverse
proxy serving HTTP the internet
container will be deployed in the same
pod as a monolith container because it
tightly coupled before we can use the
Internet's container to serve HTTP
traffic we'll need some TLS certificates
in this tutorial we'll store a set of
celsa and TLS certificates and
kubernetes as secrets and we won't dive
into all the details here but we want to
be secure so we'll need some certs let's
look at the search we have for this
particular application the cert type in
and the key type in files will be used
to secure traffic on a monolith server
and the CA that pim will be used by HTTP
clients as a CA to trust since the
starts being used by the model list
server were signed by the CA represented
by CAPM HTTP clients that trust CA DAP M
will be able to validate the SSL
connection to the monolith server next
we'll use QC TL to create the TLS certs
secret from the TLS certificates stored
under the TLS directory Coop's ETL will
create a key for each file in a TLS
directory under the TLS certs
secret bucket use the Kushi detail
described command to verify this the
secure monolith pod requires an engine s
config to handle the secure reverse
proxy let's review the engine s
configuration file that does this the
proxy cough configuration file causes
engine next to listen on port 443 for
secure connections and proxy traffic to
localhost on 484 the model of the
container is listening this works
because the engine X and model of
containers share a network namespace
while running in the same pod next we
need to create a config map entry for
the proxy Comp engine next configuration
file using the coop CTL create config
map command use the QT tail describe
config map command to get more details
about the nginx proxy kampf config map
entry at this point we're ready to
attach the engine s configuration files
and tailor certificates to the secure
monolith pod</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
