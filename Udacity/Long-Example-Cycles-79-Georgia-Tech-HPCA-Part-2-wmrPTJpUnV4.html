instructions to issue so from now on we
will not be issuing things let's see
what can we dispatch well we have an
instruction here that is ready and we
have an instruction here they are going
to different unit so they can actually
both dispatch in the same cycle so now
both of these instructions have been
dispatched and we will broadcast a
result but there is nothing executing
currently so we don't broadcast anything
so we will mark that the subtract here
which is this instruction started
executing in cycle seven it's going to
become eligible for because adds and
subtracts take two cycles so in seven
and eight this is a one execute its
going to try to broadcast in cycle nine
the multiplication here which is this
instruction also starts executing in
cycle seven is going to take ten cycles
so in cycle 17 it's going to try to
broadcast the result the other
instructions are going to wait for these
two so basically what that means is that
nothing is really going to happen now
until the cycle in which one of these
two tries to broadcast anything because
the dispatches are not going to happen
because there is nothing that can go
issue cannot happen because we are done
issuing everything so we cannot going to
fast-forward I mean cycle eight pretty
much nothing happens except that these
two are executing in cycle nine what's
going to happen is this instruction is
going to try to broadcast and because
there is nothing else that wants to
broadcast in this cycle this locust will
happen so what's now going to happen is
this subtract is going to find a
register that matches its tag which is
f8 write the value to f8 and the value
is going to be minus 2.5 minus 7.1 so
it's going to be minus 9.6 we're going
to undry named f8 so that it now forces
future instructions to read from f8
we're going to find instructions that
are waiting for add one like here and
put minus nine point six instead of the
tag and then we are going to free this
reservation station okay and the the
subtract has been writing the result in
nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
