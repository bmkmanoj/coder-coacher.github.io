elements are sized let's talk about how
to start arranging them together let's
have a quick refresher on what you
learnt in Android fundamentals 1 about
the core layout managers like frame
layout linear layout and relative layout
now remember a frame layout arranges the
views inside it one on top of each other
and each view can have a gravity or
stretch to fill the width or height of
the parent frame layout so frame layouts
a great way to display overlapping
content a linear layout arranges its
children in a single direction for
example a vertical linear layout or
raises its children from top to bottom
meaning a layout is one of the most
useful layouts to have in your toolbox
you can create pretty much any layout
with it be careful though not to over
rely on this as another layout might
actually be more efficient way to create
the desired effect a relative layout
arranges its child views relative to
each other or to its bounds so for
example a field can align to the top
left or top right or to the bottom edge
of the relative layout while relative
layout can be powerful it also has some
performance implications so be wary of
using this layout especially near the
root of your hierarchy a grid layout
arranges its children in a grid shocker
when each child has a given row or
column within that grid they can be
arranged automatically in any direction
and now have a weight property in order
to fill a column or row grid layout is a
great way if you want to align content
along multiple axes such as vertically
and horizontally at the same time in a
grid which you would be hard to achieve
with a different nested layout manager a
scroll view is a very simple view which
holds one single child allows you to
scroll its contents either up or down in
Android fundamentals we also touched on
the ListView and it's newer cousins
recycler view and view pager and how it
dynamically uses a small number of child
views to present a small window into a
larger collection list view and recycler
view let you scroll through a list of
items while view pager lets you
horizontally page through individual
items to understand when to use a
particular view group let's take a look
at some examples of real-world screens
and talk about how you would build
after that we'll show you a quiz and ask
you yes you to apply layouts to build up
a relatively complex UI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
