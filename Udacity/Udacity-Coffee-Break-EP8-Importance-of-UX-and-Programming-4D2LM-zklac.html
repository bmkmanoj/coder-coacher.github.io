break I'm Brenna and I work with Udacity
student community I'm Ervin and I'm a
software engineer here at Udacity and I
saw a bunch of people here on Saturday
since you know about the community can
we tell us about what was going on yes
on Saturday we had a really cool
workshop here girl develop it is an
organization that works to broaden
access to education for women and girls
who want to learn software development
and other things so on Saturday they
hosted a day-long UX workshop where we
had about 25 students in here who went
from brainstorming to presenting the
final product that they had developed it
was a great day that's awesome can you
tell us a little bit more about who was
running it yeah um so on Saturday we had
to folks who were running the UX side of
things and we also had one person reppin
programming so they were kind enough to
take some time to tell us why it's
important to learn UX and why it's
important to learn programming that when
you're able to program it empowers you
to be able to enhance your life in a lot
of ways right even if it's just
programming your spreadsheet to figure
out how to get groceries better or if
its programming some browser extension
to help you use your website better I
mean I basically imagine a future where
everybody just uses programming to just
slightly enhance whatever it is they
already do in life right and that's the
cool thing about programming is it mixes
well with all these other things oh my
god user interfaces are everywhere so
you see a street sign um when you're
driving I nearly had an accident the
other day because the arrow was kind of
pointing there but not quite sure if the
arrow was pointing that way but I mean
interfaces that we interact with our
everywhere so it's not even just
technology but everyone it's so
important to really put yourself as a
designer into the show shoes of somebody
who'll be interacting with your
interface so that you prevent errors so
that you help people accomplish their
goals and you can have such an impact in
terms of how people experience
technologists technology act
you know but how people experience
things if you do a good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
