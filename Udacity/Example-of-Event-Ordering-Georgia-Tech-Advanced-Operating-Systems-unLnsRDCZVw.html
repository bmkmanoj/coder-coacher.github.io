ordering a ticket to go to India via
Expedia and Delta let's now identify all
the events that are connected directly
by they happen before relationship so if
these are the events in my process then
we know that a happened before each and
we know that each happened before hi
and we know that I happened before
health so that's the textual ordering
and we know that process is sequential
this is the ordering of events in my
process and similarly we can see that if
these are the events and expedience
process then all these events have to be
sequentially ordered so B should have
happened before C C should have happened
before F F should have happened before G
&amp;amp; G should have happened before M so
these are the orderings of the events in
Expedia's process and similarly we can
derive the order of events in the Delta
process as sequential and these are all
the communication events that are
directly relating events happening
between any two processes that I'm
showing you in this picture so for
instance e to F is a message from Delta
back to Expedia confirming my
reservation so E is the act of sending
the message from Delta and F is the act
of receiving the same message from Delta
on Expedia so those are all the
communication events and now you can
also look at transitive events so for
instance what is the relationship
between let's say event E and event a
well it turns out that a must have
happened before event E and the reason
is if you look at a it happened before B
we happen before C C happen before D all
of these are communication events pretty
straightforward so from here to here
it's not a communication event but since
the process is sequential we should have
happened before C and of course C happen
before dietz's since it's a
communication event sequential process D
should happen before E and that's what
gives a transitive relationship between
a and E then a must have happened before
e similarly we can identify other events
that are transitively connected to one
another
because of they happen before
chip so for instance D and M apparently
don't have any direct connection but
through the transitivity of events that
are happening sequentially and through
the communication and sequentiality of
the process we know that D must have
happened before M so those are
transitive events and finally let's look
at concurrent events if you think about
this event M that's happening in Expedia
basically experience confirmed to me
that I have the booking that I want then
it was doing some internal bookkeeping
to record some information about me
maybe my preferences in terms of
Airlines and so on and so forth and from
that point of view it is making some
internal bookkeeping and that's this
event N and now if you look at this
event M it has no relationship to any of
the events that are happening here I'm
showing G this event H must have
happened after G but what about H and M
there is no relationship between these
two guys this could have happened much
later than than this in wall clock time
or it could happen much sooner than
event M so you can see that H is
concurrent with them and in fact all the
events that you see here are going to be
concurrent with him and similarly all
the events that you are seeing over here
they are concurrent with M so in fact
after this if you look at the Delta
process after Delta has sent this
message to Expedia confirming my booking
it may have done a whole bunch of events
over here all of those events are
concurrent with M because there was no
ordering between these events and the
events over here but there is an
ordering between the event G and the
event J here because G happened before
each H happened before I
I happen before J so you can see the
transitivity connects events across
machines but there could be events that
are happening in the distributed system
that unconnected to other events and
those are concurrent events that
completes discussion of the basics of
distributed system next we're going to
start talking about lamport's clock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
