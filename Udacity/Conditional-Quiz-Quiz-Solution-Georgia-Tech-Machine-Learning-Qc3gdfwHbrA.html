this out by use and letting them figure
it out while I figure it out I think you
should figure this out okay let's figure
it out
so it might not be obvious just looking
at it blankly so why don't we just throw
in some values here so for example we
can do this mm-hmm which is forgets
Filton in both places so the probability
that thunder is true given lightning is
false and storm is true what is that
number well so we just have to find the
place in our little eight row table
where lightning is false and storm is
true when lightning is false and storm
is true uh-huh which is there uh-huh and
the probability that thunder is true is
0.04 divided by 0.40
because we're asking about thunder right
what's the probability that thunder is
true given the other two things
lightning is false and and storm is true
so that's going to be divided by the
point four that's the setting that we're
in right and point O four divided by 0.4
is 0.1 right so maybe we'll get lucky
and it'll work out the same with the
other one so where do we have to look
for that one well now we have to look in
the row where Lightning is false and
storm is false okay so it's down here
and look at the case where thunder is
true and that's point O three and 0.03
divided by 0.3 which is also point one
whoo so that works as an answer it turns
out that in fact no matter what you type
into these two boxes it does in fact
work and what does that tell us well it
tells us that it doesn't matter what the
value of storm is we can figure out the
value of thunder by only looking at the
value of lightning so that is to say
that the probability of thunder given
lightning and storm is equal to the
probability of thunder given lightning
or that we have conditionally
independent variables yes that's right
storm is conditionally independent of
thunder given lightning right so the
probability of thunder giving like given
lightning and storm is equal to the
probability of thunder given lightning
that means that thunder and storm are
conditionally independent given
lightning or thunder is conditionally
independent of storm given lightning
sure very good all right so now what
we're gonna do next is say okay well
given that we have this nice property
and yeah I worked a little bit to make
sure that the numbers worked out it
doesn't always happen this way but here
we had some nice conditional
independence and what we're going to
next is look at a nice representation of
that kind of information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
