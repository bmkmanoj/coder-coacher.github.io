biologist here at 23andme have been with
the company for about two years now and
I'm mostly working on their ancestry
products which ran from a variety of
different problems before that I was a
postdoc at UC Berkeley for another two
years and even before that I was a PhD
student in France and yes that's why I'm
great well at this point in the lesson
we've been learning a lot about how to
connect the dots in our genome to figure
out ancestry and we've learned a little
bit about identity by state where we can
sort of match snv's for comparisons and
we've just learned a little bit about
identity by descent or IBD and what we
really want to know from a computational
biologist is how do you determine IBD or
identity by descent yeah so first maybe
we should define exactly what eibd or
identity by descent is so I BD is
something that refers to a chunk of
continuous DNA and we say that two
individuals share a chunk of DNA
identical by descent if this chunk has
been inherited through a common ancestor
without recombination it means that you
inherited this segments from the common
ancestor however far back it was in the
past and it was never broken by a
recombination event during meiosis so if
you want the simplest example of
identity by descent maybe is between a
parent and his child where because of
the way if I refer you back to a high
school biology because of the way
chromosomes are inherited a child will
inherit one chromosome exactly from each
of his parents and so a child is 50%
identical by descent with each parent
and he's just in this case a common
ancestor is a parent himself and the
child is 50% IVD with with the parent
and so it doesn't matter how big the
segment as the segment could be the
whole length of the chromosome itself or
anything shorter than that exactly so if
you only look one generation back in
time
the segment will cover a full chromosome
in the child the full chromosome in the
child will be identical by descent with
this parrot if you go one more
generation with with a child is about
twenty-five percent IBD with each of
these four grandparents but there
already is twenty-five percent is only
approximate and it can vary you can be
more I biggie you can share more I
biggie with one grandparents and with
another just because of the way
recombination occurs i see so there may
be an average rick an average IBD but it
doesn't have to be exact because like
you say the recombination doesn't happen
in the same place every time exactly and
also because of our ability to detect it
there is some error some statistically
all around the estimation of IBD which
in the end will need to slightly tipsy
and the further in time is a more
variation you have between those
percentages for solutions segments
become and how to relate IBG nids IBD
for this first one observes the
recombination process it would be great
if ragged but all it tells us where this
is where recombination occurs but and
even worse we don't even know the
genealogy that release QE dividuals even
if they're kind of closely related is
their second cousin most people just
ignore the truth treatable we don't know
how far back tonight and you'll know
very important to practice right from
there
which is ideas identity by state you can
definitely detect segments between
individuals at all or all of you IBD
algorithm works we start by winning long
segments of IPs and that gives us some
kind of candidate pool of IBD segments
and then we apply vice filters from
these sets to extract the IBD segments
and those filters are very depend on the
length of the segment meaning that it's
pretty unlikely to have a very long IPS
segment that was not generated by a
common ancestor we have we also apply
filter for the frequency of the segment
that was inherited if the segment is
very very frequent in a population maybe
it's not idea it's not a biggie it's
just IDs and that rose to to being fixed
in the population because maybe of
natural selection or other other reasons
so frequency quality of the segment
which contains many mutations then it's
unlikely to be IBD we have a lot of
filters like yeah it sounds like you
really have to think a lot around how to
make sure that it's a true identity by
descent and not like you say either
coincidental or something else so let me
make sure I even understand this the
smaller the segment that the smaller the
segment that appears to be commonly
shared the more likely it could be that
it's just you know a match of identity
by state by chance with someone random
and the population that's correct so
maybe I should clarify the definition of
IBD a little bit because under the
definition i gave actually everyone is
IBD everywhere just because we all have
a common ancestor if we go far enough
back in time so when we talk about IBD
we usually restrict ourselves to the
recent past say a few tens of
generations maybe a thousand years and
what what's beyond this point we
we just don't have the power to decide
anymore if it's IBD or not but if you go
if you look small enough everyone is I
biggie everywhere um how difficult are
these algorithms to write actually you
know essentially predict or infer IBD so
they're pretty sophisticated now and the
difficulty comes mostly from the fact
that these algorithms need to be fast so
the main computational challenge with
IBD is that the problem is fundamentally
quadratic meaning that we want to
compare all pairs of individuals with in
order asset it's fine probably if you're
in an academic setting and you study you
have your one of analysis and you have
one or two thousand individuals and you
just want to compute IBD once you're
okay with letting your computers run for
months and then you have your result in
your hobby but in a setting like the one
we have here at when is friendly first
we have orders of magnitude more of
individuals we have more than three
hundred thousand individuals now in the
database and we need to recompute IBD
every time we have new customer coming
so every day we have new customers
coming in and we need to compute ID be
permanently on the fly with them so we
really need to sink a lot of how to make
this algorithm faster so that's the
first difficulty is that's purely
computational the second difficulty is
more i would say algorithmic where we
need to find ways without compromising
the speed of the algorithm to make it as
accurate as possible and the good thing
for the second point is that we have
pretty sophisticated way now of testing
the algorithm so of course an algorithm
is gonna make mistakes that's guaranteed
but we can
we can assess the rate at which makes
mistake pretty pretty well now through
other simulations in which we simulate a
pedigree and so we know exactly which
segments are IBD because of the way we
run the simulations or through pedigrees
that our customers report to us so our
customers can tell us who their parents
are in the database user first cousins
are in the database and so we can
compare the prediction of our algorithm
to the known truth and that gives us a
good sense of how accurate the
algorithms are that's amazing and it
does sound sophisticated what about Miss
user mistakes if someone thinks that
they know who their father is and it
turns out not to be true yeah that
definitely happens we trust the law of
large number i guess and so because we
have lots of people reporting zar their
pedigrees and guess that not everything
is wrong and we can still extract a lot
of it's still a very powerful data set
we have other ways of checking whether
someone is really the key love of
someone without doing a BBS there is
some more obvious stuff that you can do
so this isn't just a static feature that
you work on i mean it's constantly
changing you're always having to work on
it or update it we do we're updating it
now but we definitely try to minimize
the number of times we need to update
the features not because it's not fun to
develop new algorithm but because of the
cost of recomputing every time we change
the algorithm we don't have just to do
this incremental update for new
customers but we have to recompute
everything all three hundred thousand
Austrian and it's still even with fast
algorithm we're still talking about
months and months and months of Tresor
time so where do you get your computing
power I mean as a as a non computer
science or or coding or statistical or
math person how much can we can you
relate to me how much computing power
we're talking about here and so on
productions they have their own cluster
that computes for new customers and I'm
not too sure how big it is in research
we also have our own cluster it's
hundred and twenty CPUs so it's not huge
this is definitely challenging to run
very very large scale experiments on
this cluster and my guess is that soon
we'll have to go to the cloud we're
actually talking to Google compute
engineers to be able to compute IBD on
their machines just because it will scan
much better what happens if you get I
don't know three million people will you
break the system on I mean you foresee
getting to a point where so many people
participate that the computational power
isn't isn't high enough it's definitely
hard to keep up with the growth of the
database but it's doable and the fact
that we build our algorithms to be
incremental means that it's pretty easy
for us to separate the customers into
smaller batches and run and run on each
batch and get a job done but yeah well
you know speaking some more on the
computational side of things I want you
to talk to us for a minute about what
what computational biology is all about
I mean you have a particular job at 23
Emmy which you seem to really like um
but to let's say budding geneticists
young young middle or old people you
know interested in genetics and looking
for maybe a job or career change what is
it about computational biology that's
appealing or useful well so a
computational biologist I think is
always someone was trying to develop or
at least to implement computational
methods to analyze biological data so in
in my field in genetics even in my field
there is a wide variety of different
data and a wide variety of different
applications so the computational
biologists could be someone developing
pipeline to analyze war genome sequences
for example just from the raw data 20
lineman's to calling the snv's from the
raw data and just process the data so
it's
really for statisticians for example to
try to preserve process it could be
someone like me was for me a very bad
very big part of my job is machine
running so it could be someone who's
really interested in machine learning
and trying to extract sense from the
data directly it comes from the from the
realization i think that amount of
genetic data is huge and growing really
fast and even maybe more problematic is
the complexity of the data like any
single phenotype is going to be
influenced by not any single but many
many phenotypes is going to be
influenced by a lot of different genes
it's very very out to to find exactly
the structure in the data so machine
learning is one way to to tackle the
problem and I think it's a way that's
proved successful already so yeah and it
sounds you know based on what you're
saying that you know the information age
is just growing bigger and bigger
especially in the world of genetics so
the need for understanding and the need
for people who can actually use this
information in the state is really
important YUM how many how often do you
find the biologists the trained
geneticists or biologists understand
enough coding or computer science and
move forward versus how often is it that
it's the math and computer science
people who are learning the biology to
help out which direction is it normally
so here at 20 thread me I think it's
safe to say that all the computational
biologists came from the computer side
of things they of training either in
computer science or in maths or in
statistics and they learn biology later
as fascinating application filled for
data scientists basically and so as you
know biology and genetics course you
think there will be an opportunity for
many more computational individuals who
are interested to sort of learn genetics
and biology and apply that yes
definitely I think
we think that biology is the science of
the 21st century nothing less and it
will change everything for most people
it will revolutionize medicine being
preventable or personalized it will yeah
it will basically change the daily life
of everyone I guess and we need more
people and I think many many more jobs
are going to be created around around in
a computational biology can you talk to
us maybe a bit about just in general the
type of coding you've done while you
worked for 23 me or even beyond 23andme
I'm you mentioned that you've worked on
the ancestry and specifically IBD are
there other aspects that you worked on
as well so I developed another features
at 23andme code ancestry composition
which goal is to find the origin of of
segments not as precise of finding who
you share it with but where does it come
from so it could come from some part of
Europe it could come from some part of
East Asia or some part of Africa so here
it's we applied very very different
methods the type of coding there was
very much the machine learning type of
cutting so it's a lot of numerical
analysis where you're trying to predict
classes for your data so it's a lot of
you you end up developing a lot of
optimization problems a lot of dynamic
programming is involved in this kind of
problems for example when you could
hidden Markov model to relate adjustment
adjustment chunks of DNA and there is
some very well known dynamic program
that you need to implement to make this
thing fast and to be able to optimize it
to fit your data as well as possible how
do you think the future of biology and
jeanette
looks with regards to computer science
and computational biology do you think
there's going to be a big need for
geneticists in general and people who
study biology to learn these skills as
they go along or do you think they're
just going to need to partner up with
other people who know them I think you
could defend bus by point of view
obviously I think there is still a lot
of value for being a specialist in your
field obviously you cannot be good at
everything and I think good biologists
and good geneticist who can give people
with a strong computational background
you know hints at what they should be
looking at and advice and what is
important in the field where is the
problems we need to solve first is
definitely very valuable so I think
there is room for there is still room
for pure biologists definitely well tell
us a bit more about your background I
mean how did you get interested I mean
well first I should ask how did you get
here what did you study in school and
how did you get interested in it so my
undergrad was in applied math and
computer science and then I went on to
do a PhD in statistics and because the
way that was in France and because the
way it works in France I had to choose a
field of application for statistics and
that's only then that I began to think
about genetics because my pee I was very
interested in population genetics which
is this field in genetics where we try
to learn about human evolution so
natural selection demography ancestry
identity by descent so and I became
interested as well and i developed
statistical learning method to learn
about the genetic structure
subpopulations after my PhD I decided to
do a postdoc here at UC Berkeley because
I had a very good opportunity with
someone very famous in the field of
population genetics and there I was
lucky enough to work on the first draft
of the Neanderthal genome so I actually
had the first full neonatal genome
sitting on my hard drive and I could
just do my my stuff with it anything I
wanted it's awesome and I contributed to
develop methods that that estimated the
amount of Neanderthal DNA that modern
humans of today so that was a pretty
fascinating project no big deal right no
big deal wait why I think it was a
pretty big deal because it changed the
view of people in the fields like before
before 2010 most people would including
me probably would have said no Nana tell
is strictly distinct species it never
contributed any DNA to modern humans
just was extreme for some reason and
didn't leave any trace and now we know
that's probably not true and that left a
few percent it's pretty exciting a
project to work on yeah and then I you
always knew about 20 straight me I've
known about them since they started
almost in 2008 and so when I was there I
was local and so I knew that it was a
good opportunity to apply and so it was
his job openings were advertising for a
computational biologist position at
first I didn't know exactly what it
implies and so I sent my CV was
interviewed and got the job and since
then it's been amazing and here you are
yeah so it sounds like you had a major
interest in you know basic math a love
for math computation you know which sort
of blossomed into you know an applied or
an application and biology if there was
somebody watching this interview right
now and they're really intrigued about
how biology and computer science and
math statistics work together in a
particular job what advice would you
give them to study in school what would
you recommend that they do when maybe
where would you recommend that they seek
you know career advice or work from yeah
so as I said I do believe there is needs
for specialists so
do recommend they keep studying math and
computer science and statistics a lot
but they still need to take some biology
at the very least to figure what are the
problems that we need to solve today in
biology and how to relate you know it's
not enough to get out of school and no
list of 10 fastest algorithm for each
specific problems that you learn in
school you also need to be able to
relate to great class of algorithms to
different problems in biology oh you
will need to adapt them how sometimes
you have to realize that there is
nothing that exists already and you need
to develop something that's not going to
be optimal probably but you need to do a
first pass as a problem so you do need
to know enough biology at the very least
to understand some problems otherwise
for example for ancestry if you don't
have a very clear understanding of the
recombination process there is nothing
you can do you need you need to
understand exactly what probabilistic
model you can put behind meiosis how
often it's going to break a chromosome
all these things so you do need to know
it not biology to in a sense of problems
definitely so you need to take at least
an intro to biology class or or
something at the very least so for
someone who's interested you know you
know Kendall that passion for computer
science and math but you know also you
pay attention in biology class yeah and
yeah and just I guess just do it I think
it's I think it's the most exciting
exciting field for data scientists to be
in now it's just growing amazingly fast
and it's already changed a lot of things
I want to ask you to more questions you
I will edit these back a little bit cuz
I want that to be sort of how we close
um I want to know what's probably what's
one of the best moments of being you and
having your job like what's one of the
the most positive parts or most exciting
moments you've had so I'm lucky a 23 and
me because I have both of food in
research and a freaking product and I
think the most satisfying moment is when
you pull
research to make a product out of it and
when you see customers start to use it
and then you know if you're interested
in science and you publish a very good
paper you're super lucky you get a
thousand citations it's already kind of
a lifetime achievement but here he puts
if you make a product out of your
research is going to be seen by hundreds
of thousands of people instantly and
they're going to react about it or going
to talk about it we're going to give you
new ideas about it is we're going to
find bugs you never sought you out in
the first place because three hundred
thousand pairs of eyes you know it's
much more than than yours so that's
that's definitely very satisfying and
what would you say is probably one of
the most difficult or challenging
aspects of what you do and that's a good
question I guess testing is probably the
hardest yeah everyone believes they
write good code everyone believes or
good is fast but not everyone tests
enough especially when you're in a
production setting where you're going to
put a lot of stress on your algorithm so
the most difficult part I think is to
make sure everything works as intended
there is no it's going to stay fast
you're going to your you need to have a
very good understanding of you know the
algorithm complexities algorithmic
complexity of what you code just to make
sure you're not going to receive an
email on Sunday saying oh you broke the
website and we're losing a lot of money
fix it so yeah you need to test a lot
would say great well thank you Eric for
joining us thanks much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
