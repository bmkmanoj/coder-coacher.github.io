fundamental problem in motion planning
is that ever word might live in a world
like this it might want to find its way
to a goal like this and it has to devise
a plan to get there the same problem
occurs for a self-driving car that might
live in a city near a highway on the
network of streets it has to find its
way around and navigate to its target
location if we zoom in and look at this
intersection and this is my best
rendering of a street light environment
we have also planning problems here for
example picture our car coming from here
which is to go over here to take a left
turn on this intersection over here this
car would have to turn right first
engage in a lane shift and then take the
left turn to the goal location now a
lane shift over here is a risky
proposition it has a big truck parked
over here the space might be
insufficient to carry out the lane shift
so no turn ative plan might be to go
straight over here take the detour
around the block and then go straight
for the target location the process of
finding a path from a start location to
goal location is called planning and for
robots is often called robot motion
planning so today I'm going to talk
about discrete methods for planning in
which the world is chopped into small
bins in the next class you're going to
talk about continuous motion using those
plans so what's the planning problem
we're given a map of the world they give
them a starting location they're given a
goal location and usually we give them
some sort of a cost function in the
simplest way think of course just the
time it takes to drive a certain route
and the goal is find the minimum cost
path so before we program anything let
me see if I can ask you a couple of
questions for minimum cost paths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
