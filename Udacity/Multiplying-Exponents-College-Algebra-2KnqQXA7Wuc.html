interesting remember that we started out
with three squared times 3 to the fourth
power and we ended up with three to the
sixth power what we need to notice here
is how the exponents are related to each
other two plus four are two original
exponents is equal to six the final
exponent so this actually shows us a
general rule for multiplying factors
that have exponents if the two numbers
that were multiplying together have the
same base then their exponents just add
to one another and the bass stays the
same so let's write that in a more
general way if we have some number or
variable a and it's taken to the power
of B and then that's multiplied by
another number a that's taken to the
power C then together that
multiplication can be written as a to
the power of B plus C so like we saw in
the last quiz three to the second x 3 to
the fourth is equal to 3 to the 2 plus 4
which is equal to 3 to the sixth power
just like we found out in the end since
exponents indicate repeated
multiplication since each of these
factors right here is just the number or
variable a being multiplied by itself
over and over again some number of times
when they're multiplied together it's
just even more a's multiplied together
or some different number of A's
multiplied together this is just a
convenient way for us to not have to
write out all of the numbers like we did
we're doing this last quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
