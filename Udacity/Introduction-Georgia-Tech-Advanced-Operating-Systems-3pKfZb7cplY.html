an operating system is a complex
software system especially the protocol
stack that sits within an operating
system is several hundred thousand lines
of code and developing such a complex
software system in general protocol
stack in particular to meet specs and
also deliver very good performance is no
mean challenge let's keep over to the
other side of the fence and see how
complex hardware systems for example a
CPU chip like this one with billions of
transistors on it is built VLSI
technology uses component based approach
to building large and complex hardware
systems can we mimic the same method for
building large complex software systems
that is rather than start with a clean
slate can we reuse software components
this is very tempting since component
based design will be easy to test and
optimize at an individual component
level and also it will allow for easy
evolution and extension through the
addition and deletion of components the
idea of component based design is
orthogonal to the structure of the
operating system that we've seen in
previous lessons be the monolithic
kernel or a microkernel based design the
idea of component based design can be
applied to each subsystem within an
operating system of course there are
challenges can this lead to
inefficiencies in performance due to the
additional component level function
calls could it lead to loss of locality
when we cross boundaries of components
could it lead to unnecessary
redundancies such as copying etc is it
possible to give the advantages of
component based design without losing
performance the short answer is yes if
we can put theory and practice together
we will explore this topic more in this
lesson the idea is to synthesize network
protocol stack
from components how do we do that well
that's what we're going to see in this
lesson and in this lesson Cornell's
ensemble project is used as a backdrop
to illustrate how to build complex
systems by using components and using a
component based approach to putting
together a large complex software system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
