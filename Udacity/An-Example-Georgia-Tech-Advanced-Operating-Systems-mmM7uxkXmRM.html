using on an everyday basis such as
airline reservation or Gmail or web
surfing as giant scale services as
opposed to the services that you get
within your own organization example of
file server
there's a later module in this course
called internet scale computing and in
that we will discuss programming models
and resource management issues for
providing such giant scale services the
focus at this point however is to show
how object technology facilitates
structuring such services let's look at
an example to put things in perspective
let's say you want to purchase a
round-trip ticket to go from Atlanta to
Chennai India with a few clicks you can
send your request over to a portal such
as Expedia and Expedia then goes to work
for you it contacts a whole bunch of
different airlines gets the best options
that are available from all these
different choices and then it comes back
to you with a bunch of options now you
may take your own sweet time deciding
which one of those you may want to pick
based on cost perhaps convenience
guarantees for example you don't want
your baggage to end up in Timbuktu so
based on all of that you may want to
make a decision maybe you have to talk
to your spouse or significant other
siblings children so on in order to make
the final decision finally you decide
then commit to buying the ticket and
then Expedia will complete the
transaction based on the choice that you
made and you get your ticket and life is
good well not so fast while you're busy
procrastinating with your choices
there's another person who is planning
almost an exact similar trip to your
same date same constraint same
destination and so on and you can
immediately see that without your
realizing you are actually competing for
resources in this case a physical
resource a seat on a particular flight
going from Atlanta
India with others that you don't even
know exist on this planet therefore the
service provider in this case multiple
enterprises involved Expedia and all the
airline's together that are handling
your request they all have to work
together to make sure that they resolve
any resource conflict that might occur
between simultaneous requests across
space and time coming from several
different clients so all the issues that
we have discussed in the context of
parallel and distributed systems
synchronization communication Adama city
of actions concurrency all of these
become important and the surface in this
very simple example across space and
time and additionally all services need
some common features for example a
shopping cart on your browser and in
fact even though this particular example
is illustrating an airline reservation
if it comes to booking a ticket on a
train or getting hotel reservation or
booking tickets to go see a game all of
those things have similar requirements
and many of them are probably repeatable
and many of them such as the shopping
cart in this example are features that
might be needed even of the services
that we are talking about a completely
different such as an airline reservation
and hotel booking so since the same
issues crop up in the implementation of
each new service we don't want to
reinvent the wheel every time this is
where object technology comes in the
power of reuse of components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
