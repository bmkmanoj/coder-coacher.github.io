of files that I used in my manifest I
could just list every file coming from a
directory listing from my server but I
don't want to grab things like Python
files so the easiest thing to do is to
get files that you know you're going to
need like the images that I knew were
referenced and the JavaScript files and
then walk through one at a time and see
what happens when you try to run the app
from the cash let's try this now let's
take a couple of these files out and see
what happens let's save the manifest
file and go back and reload now remember
even though we've downloaded a new cash
here what we're looking at over here is
not that uploaded content we need to
refresh one more time and now you'll
notice that when i try to get this file
from my application it just fails now if
i had put in my manifest file under the
network section star that would mean
anything could come from the network i
find as a useful trick to not use
network star because then you can see
what's failing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
