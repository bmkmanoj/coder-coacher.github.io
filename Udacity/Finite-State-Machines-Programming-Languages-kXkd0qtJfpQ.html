expressions such as matching a word or a
number to do this we're going to
introduce a visual representation for
regular expressions that actually shows
exactly what's going on behind the
scenes and then we're going to follow
along in Python suppose we have the
regular expression 0 through 9 + % any
character like this that just appears on
its own is matched directly so this
catches strings like 30% 99 % - % and
various other things we might find
describing sales or the fat content of
milk here I've drawn a finite state
machine a visual representation of this
regular expression often there's an
arrow coming out of nowhere on the left
that's not connected to the rest of the
picture that indicates where we start
these three circles are States they
represent what we're up to when we're
matching a string against the regular
expression what configuration we're in
what our current state of mind is what
we've seen so far I've labeled by States
1 2 &amp;amp; 3 these other arrows are called
edges or transitions they tell us when
to move from one state to another I
start in state 1 and if I see a 0
through 9 I move over to state 2 this 0
through 9 is the label associated with
this edge finally you'll notice that one
of my states has a double circle that's
an accepting state if we end up in an
accepting state at the end of the input
this finite state machine matches the
given string let's trace through what
happens on input 23% we start in the
start state and the character we see is
it - so we follow this edge to state 2
now the next thing we see is a 3 so we
follow this edge back to state 2 these
are sometimes called self loops it's a
loop that takes me back to right where I
started now we see the % loop and we end
up in state 3 which is an accepting
state so our finite state machine
accepts this string 23 percent just like
our regular expression would let's try
just this string - we start in the start
state we see a - so we move over here
then we're done we ran out of input but
we're not in the accepting State our
finite state machine rejects this just
like our regular expression would
finally let's consider the string 2x we
start here in state 1 we see a 2 so we
go over to state 2 and then we see it X
and there's no outgoing edge from state
2 on an X so we fall off the finite
state machine and die this is very sad
and when this happens our finite state
machine does not accept the string just
like the regular expression would not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
