the value of either true or false
and so far we've been directly assigning
that value like with the code boolean b1
equals true and boolean b2 equals false
but boolean values can also be
calculated by doing tests like
comparisons and these are called boolean
expressions and expressions looks
something like this
this expression which checks if 3 is
less than 5 is something we know is true
3 is less than 5 and in fact this
expression evaluates to the boolean
value of true and we can assign that
value to a boolean variable like before
and let's name this one B 3 so here B 1
and B 3 are equal to the same value true
but B 3 is assigned to the value of this
comparison and not to true directly then
if we wrote this expression which checks
if 3 is greater than 5 this would
evaluate to the boolean value of false
since 3 is not greater than 5 and then B
2 and B 4 will have the same value there
are a number of ways that we can compare
numbers or variables that will evaluate
to true or false in addition to these
less-than and greater-than expressions
we can also have less than or equal to
and greater than or equal to and let's
use these in examples too we could
compare two numbers again like to test
if 7 is less than or equal to 6 and
since 7 is greater than 6 then this
expression is not true it evaluates to
false and instead of using numbers we
can use variables in these comparisons
too like say we've declared an integer
variable named X and initialized it to
10 before starting these comparisons we
can then compare that variable to
another number or variable like this
expression which tests is X greater than
or equal to 10
Java will see this and say X is 10 so
yes it's equal to 10 and the expression
is true and if we want to only test for
equality we use double equal signs so we
can test something like if X is equal to
9 and since 10 is not equal to 9 this
expression will evaluate to false and
let's look at this equality check in
detail in Java the double equal sign
tests for equality
and is not to be mistaken with the
single equal sign which in Java is a
variable assignment so when we write x
equals equals nine this expression is
the equivalent of the boolean value
false and our variable X will still be
equal to ten but if we said x equals
nine with one equals this would change
the value of x from ten to nine and no
boolean value will be calculated so
remember to use double equal signs to
check for equality and to check if two
values are not equal we use exclamation
point equals where this exclamation
point means not and so X not equal to
nine will evaluate to true because 10 is
not equal to nine it's the opposite of
the previous equality check and because
all these types of expressions evaluate
to true or false they are often used as
test conditions in decision-making if
statements but before we get to using
these for decision making let's get more
practice evaluating these expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
