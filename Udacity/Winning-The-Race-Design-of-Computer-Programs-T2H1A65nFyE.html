paint constraint up to the highest point
it will go we get this and now I checked
and the original version of the puzzle
that I set running is still running and
now i can hit run on this and in less
than a second I see my result 15 meaning
water is drunk in house number 1 and the
zebra is owned in house number 5 so this
is an amazing thing it's as if we had a
car race and we had the start here and
the finished someplace far away and we
had this competitor car which was the
original zebra puzzle car will call him
Z for zebra and we said go and it
started out down the path towards the
finish we wanted to build a competitor
to that but we just let it go it's
running and we're thinking and we're
analyzing and we're not doing anything
and it's getting farther and farther
ahead and closer to the finish line and
maybe we spent half an hour and it's
halfway through it's gotten up to this
point we're still stuck at the start
sign but what we're doing is we're
building a better car we're building a
super fast race car and we're putting
the pieces together using what we know
and eventually this car has gotten a
long ways along the way and then we see
now we're ready to go and when we hit go
zoom we're there in less than a second
what took this car who had the half-hour
head start is not even close so it's
like The Tortoise and the hare only in
reverse and by thinking and coming up
with a better design we were able to
beat this original design even though we
gave them a half hour head start so we
won the race we get the checkered flag
we should be happy at what we've done
and congratulations now if you're the
type who just cares about winning the
race and finishing first we can stop
here but if you're a little bit more
analytic and you want you like to know
the exact scores and times then we got
work to do here's one thing I can do
there's the module in Python called time
in that module there's a function called
clock which gives you the time of day
and so i can set t0 to be the time
before I call the zebra puzzle t1 to be
the time after we're
and just return the difference so
that'll tell me how long the zebra
puzzle took if I hit run the answer it
came back with was zero point zero
seconds and that's because the system
I'm running on doesn't have an accurate
enough clock and I know it's accurate
down to the thousands of a second so all
we can say here is that it took less
than a thousandth of a second and I and
I've run it on other systems and it
comes back at zero point zero zero zero
two eight on that other system now I was
able to do this but this looks like a
good opportunity for generalization why
do I want to function that only times
the zebra puzzle would be great if I had
a function that could time the execution
of any function so here I've defined a
function called time call which takes
another function as input sets up the
clock calls that function calls the
clock again to figure out the time and
tells me what the elapsed time is so I
could call time call a deeper puzzle to
get the answer of how long that took or
I can apply this to any function so I
built a useful tool that i can use again
and again now i can make it even more
useful by doing two things one is saving
up the result and returning that as the
second value in case we're interested
both in the result and in how long it
took and secondly allowing functions
that take arguments now you may not have
seen this notation before so let's talk
about it for a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
