be making that there's some mysterious
entity pulling apples to the ground
which he calls some force in fact he
calls a gravity and that that same force
somehow causes the moon to go in a
circular orbit around the earth Newton
causes force gravity and there's a few
properties he claims it has he calls it
a mutually attractive force which means
that all objects anything with mass
attracts every other object with mass so
right now my hand is attracted to this
pen with some gravitational force just
as he claims the earth is attracted to
the moon next he claims his force is
proportional to 1 over R squared and
when I say r I mean the separation
distance between the center of the two
things for talking about we talked about
this idea of proportionality last time
and we know that 1 over R squared means
that if we were to say double this
distance what would happen to the force
use your knowledge of proportionality to
answer this question as best you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
