like equations but there's one exception
an inequality sign behaves differently
when you multiply or divide both sides
by a negative value let's look at that
I'm going to start by not doing division
or multiplication I'm gonna do
subtraction first I subtract 1 from both
sides and I get 1 is greater than 0 then
I can subtract 2 from both sides and I
get negative 1 is greater than negative
2 this causes a lot of trouble for
students let's look at this here's
negative 1 and here's negative 2 we know
negative 1 is closer to 0 it's further
to the right on the number line so it
must be bigger and value compared to
negative 2 but we're not after comparing
numbers here we want to know about the
inequality sign I've rewritten negative
1 is greater than negative 2 and instead
of doing the subtraction twice what if
we just would have multiplied if we
multiply both sides of our inequality by
negative 1 we'll get negative 2 and
negative 1 but I can't just carry my
inequality straight down we know
negative 1 is greater than negative 2 so
this sign has to reverse in direction
the same is true when dividing by a
negative 1 we know when we divide by a
negative 1 we change the signs of the
numbers so I'll still need to flip my
inequality sign these inequalities might
look different but they're actually
equivalent statements here I have
negative 1 is greater than negative 2
and here I have negative 2 is less than
negative 1 if we flip this entire
inequality we can see that we wind up
with the same thing we get negative 2 is
less than negative 1 the key thing to
remember when solving inequality
problems is to reverse the direction of
the sign when you multiply or divide
both sides by a negative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
