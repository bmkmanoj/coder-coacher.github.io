that we're discussing the frustration
that we have is actually the result of
past success we probably have to keep in
mind Moore's law and other laws that
apply to the improvements that have
happened to intact so things move very
quickly I talked about this in a cup and
a couple of context but you know ken
Schreiber is one of the agile
signatories he talks about three sources
of variation in software development so
one of them is infrastructure it's
changing all the time the others
requirements there's always new and
different things that we can do and the
third is people you know people working
individually and people working together
as teams and I think in this regard you
find yourself in an organization you see
that things are frustrating and I think
in order that they're not perfect and I
think you have to take the perspective
with this sword right with with these
people I will solve this problem
otherwise it becomes it becomes like
blame focused right and so out without
that appreciative inquiry and without
that belief that you're you're sort of
colleagues in your organization is
healthy and the way that I just
described your options are super limited
I can't fix the problem because it's the
attitude of my colleagues and so what I
want you to try to do is I want you to
view the situation you're in as maybe an
inevitable result of early successes and
this really changes the paradigm to
whine of like okay everything that we
hit everything that we did to get us
here today has been super helpful and
awesome it also cannot be or may not be
what takes us forward to the future so
what is that going to look like and then
you can turn right to those same people
who created the current awesome your
organization yes some pain came with
that but the current awesome and you can
work with them through inquiry to find
new ways forward
so the healthiest mindset you can have
is you approach DevOps transformation is
one of inquiry and appreciation so
appreciation for your environment
appreciation for your colleagues even an
appreciation for the for the problem
domain it's very easy to see the
limitations of your system in it in the
present moment it's easy to blame it's
much harder to to look to your
colleagues to look to the situation as
an opportunity to create new things and
I I think that's the heart of DevOps is
being able to to recognize that there is
a path forward and that path forward is
is only going to be realized when we
work together when we take a stance of
appreciative inquiry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
