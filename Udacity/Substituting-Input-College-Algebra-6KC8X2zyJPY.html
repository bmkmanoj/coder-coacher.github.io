different functions let's talk about how
to actually use them when we add a
computer program we saw that we would
take our function type the name out and
then in the parenthesis where we know
that the input goes we could type a
specific number like four for example
like we did before and then because the
function was already defined in the
program only ran this with an actual
number as the input it would give us an
answer it would spit out in this case a
one we can do a similar thing for the
mathematical version of this function
once again in the slot where the input
goes inside the parenthesis right here
we can write a number let's pick a
different one this time just to spice
things up a little bit maybe five now
the way that we use this new input of
five is the substituted into all the
places where we see X in the expression
on the right-hand side over here so in
fact the first term we see is an X so we
replace that with a five and then the
rest of the expression is the same we
started off with f of x equals x minus 3
and that means we know that F of 5 is
equal to five minus three we can
evaluate this to see that F of 5 is
equal to two so 5 here is our input and
when plugged into this function the
function relates the input of 5 to an
output which in this case is to this in
fact creates a point for us we can now
plot the point 5 comma 2 this is a point
that lies on this line since we know
that we're just replacing our dependent
variable with f of X instead of why we
graph all the values of f of X of the
function of the output just as you would
Y values on the vertical axis so what if
we have a different function instead
maybe f of x equals x squared what if I
want to plug in 4 as the input for this
equation what would the function give me
is the output then please simplify your
answer as much as possible so that it's
just a single number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
