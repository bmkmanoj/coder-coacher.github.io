bits of machine learning here and there
are a lot of tools and techniques that
are inside that hmm and I think that's
great and we're gonna be trying to teach
you a lot of those tools and techniques
and sort of ways to connect them
together so by the way as Michael was
pointing out there are kind of ways that
these things might help each other I'm
supervised learning might help
supervised learning it's actually much
deeper than that it turns out you even
though unsupervised learning is clearly
not the same as supervised learning but
the level we've described it in some
ways they're exactly the same thing
supervised learning you have some bias
oh it's a quadratic function and duck
should make sense all these kind of
assumptions you make and an unsupervised
learning I told you that we don't know
whether this cluster is better than this
cluster dividing by sex is better than
dividing by height or or hair color or
whatever but ultimately you make some
decision about how to cluster and that
means implicitly there's some assumed
signal there's some assumed set of
labels that you think make sense oh I
think things that look alike should
somehow be clustered together or things
that are near one another should be
clustered together so some ways it's
still kind of like supervised learning
you can certainly turn any supervised
learning problem into another class hmm
so in fact all of these problems are
really the same kind of problem yeah
well there's two things that I'd want to
add to that one is that in some sense in
many cases you can formulate all these
different problems as some form of
optimization in supervised learning you
want something that that labels data
well and so you're the thing you're
trying to optimize is find me a function
that does that whereas core it and
reinforcement learning we're trying to
find a behavior that scores well and so
unsupervised learning we usually have to
make up some kind of a criterion and
then we find a way of clustering the
data or organizing the data so that it
scores well so that was the first point
I wanted to make the other one is if you
divide things by sex and you're a virgin
then there's numerical instability
issues did you learn about that on the
street I learned it in a math book so
here's the thing everything Michael just
said except the last part is true but
there's actually a sort of deeper thing
going on here to me if you think about
the commonalities of everything we've
just said it boils down to one thing
data data data data data data data is
king and machine learn now Michael would
call himself a computer scientist oh
yeah and I would call myself a
computational list
I'm in a college of computing not a
department of computer science I believe
in computing and computation as being
the ultimate thing so I would call
myself a computational as' and Michel
would probably agree with that just to
keep this discussion moving let's say
right so we're computationally believe
in computing that's a good thing sure
many of our colleagues who do
computations tend to think in terms of
algorithms any think in terms of what
are the series of steps I need to do in
order to solve some problem or they
might think in terms of theorems if I
try to describe this problem in a
particular way is it solvable implicitly
by some algorithm yeah and truthfully
machine learning is a lot of that but
the difference between the person who's
trying to solve a problem as an AI
person or as a computing person and
someone who's trying to solve a problem
as a machine learning person is that the
algorithm stops being central the data
starts being central and so what I hope
you get out of this class or at least
part of the stuff that you do is
understanding that you have to believe
the data you have to do something with
the data you have to be consistent with
the data the algorithms that fall out of
all that our algorithms are they're
algorithms that take the data as primary
or at least important I'm gonna go with
co-equal so algorithms and data Ocoee
co-equal well exactly
all right they may be back in this 70s
what turns out we do agree on those
things that was close
excellent so the rest of the semester
will go exactly like this michael--ah
except you won't see us you'll see our
hands though
this height this height you'll see our
hands though thank you Michael
sorry that was good that took me back to
when I was four okay so winces hmm it's
called Senor wences yes I know yeah I
remember I'm not that much younger than
you are ten twelve years old
anyway the point is the rest of the
semester will go like this we will talk
about supervised learning and a whole
series of algorithms step back a little
bit and talk about the theory behind
them and try to connect theory of
machine learning with theory of
computing notions or at least that kind
of basic idea what does it mean to be a
hard problem versus an easier problem
we'll move into randomized optimization
and unsupervised learning where we will
talk about all the issues that we
brought up
here and try to connect them back to
some of the things that we did in the
section of supervised learning and then
finally we will spend our time on
reinforcement learning and a
generalization of these traditional
reinforcement learning which involves
multiple agents so we'll talk about a
little bit of game theory which Michael
loves to talk about I love to talk about
and the applications of all the stuff
that we've been learning to solving
problems of how to actually act in the
world how to build that robot to do
something or build that agent to play a
game or to teach you how to do whatever
you you need to be taught how to do but
at the end of the day we're gonna teach
you how to think about data how to think
about algorithms and how to build
artifacts that you know we'll learn
let's do this thing
excellent all right well thank you
Michael sure I will see you next time
we're in the same place at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
