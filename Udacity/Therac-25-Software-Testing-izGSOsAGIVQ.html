example of timing-dependent input being
difficult to deal with so in the 1980s
there's a machine called a therac-25
and what the therac-25 was as a
radiation therapy machine and it was
used to deliver a highly concentrated
beam of radiation to a part of a human
body where that beam can be used to
destroy cancerous tissue without harming
tissue that's nearby and as you can see
this is not obviously an inherently safe
technology it's going to depend on
skilled operators and also highly safe
software in order to safely dose
patients at the cancer site without
harming the patients so what happened
with the therac-25
was a tragic series of mistakes where
six people were subjected to massive
radiation overdoses and several of these
people died and I'll make sure to
include a link about these occurrences
in the supplementary material for this
course and if you'd actually take a look
at that you'll find that it's really
quite terrifying reading it's really a
very scary series of accidents the
therac-25 had a number of serious issues
with its software and we're just going
to talk about one of them here so the
filler 25 was a largely software
controlled device and it had at the time
a fairly sophisticated controller and it
turned out that the people developing
the software put a number of bugs into
it the particular bug that I'm talking
about here was a software bug called a
race condition and what a race condition
is is a scenario where different threads
of execution fail to be properly
synchronized with the result being that
the software containing the race
conditions can actually make mistakes so
this particular race condition in the
therac-25 software involved the keyboard
input to the radiation therapy machine
which is what the person operating the
machine used to tell the machine how to
treat the patient and what happened was
if the operator of the machine typed
slowly the bug was very unlikely to be
triggered and of course while the
machine was being tested the people
testing the machine weren't very good at
using it they hadn't used it a lot and
so they didn't type very fast but
unfortunately as operators in hospitals
became more and more familiar with this
machine as they treated hundreds and
hundreds of patients what happened was
these people got very good at operating
the machine they typed faster and faster
and eventually they started triggering
this bug and the effect of this bug
unfortunately was to
deliver massive radiation overdoses to
patients and as I said this led to
several fatalities and so the kind of
quandary that this sort of the scenario
raises for us as software testers is do
we have to care about the time at which
inputs arrive at our software under test
or can we not worry about that and so
obviously for the therac-25 and
obviously also for something like a
Linux kernel the time at which inputs
arrive is relevant on the other hand
unless we've been extremely sloppy the
square root function that we've been
talking about won't care about the time
at which its input inputs arrive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
