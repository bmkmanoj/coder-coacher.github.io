one by one to figure out which ones are
correct starting off with 2z we see that
this is something that is multiplied by
5x and by 7y in order to equal this term
so this is definitely a right answer now
when we look at five we need to remember
again that invisible multiplication sign
between the 5 and the X if we multiply 5
by X + 7 y + 2 Z then we get this whole
term so 5 is also a factor now 1 is
where things get a little bit tricky and
if you miss this one not a big deal
this actually is a factor of this term
and actually of any term the reason that
1 is a factor for any term we might have
whether it's a number or a variable is
because if you multiply one by that term
itself you will end up with the term
that you're looking for so in our case
the thing that we need to multiply 1 by
in order to get 5x times 7y times 2z is
just this term itself I know that might
seem a little bit complicated right now
but you'll have plenty of practice in
the upcoming quizzes to sort this all
out
bottom line one is always a factor now
first you might think that zero is
similar to 1 in this way but zero is
actually not a factor here we can't
divide this expression by zero that
would actually give us a solution that
we don't know how to interpret right now
and there's nothing that we can multiply
by zero in order to get this expression
since zero times anything is just equal
to zero so zero should not be checked
off we know that Y is multiplied by 7
and also by 5x + 2 z to come up with
this term so we should check that one
off as well and X works in the same way
so we've checked everything off except
for the zero that was great I know that
factors are a little bit trickier than
terms so I hope that this vocabulary is
starting to make a little bit of sense
we'll keep using it really frequently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
