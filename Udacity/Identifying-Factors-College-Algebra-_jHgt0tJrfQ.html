one by one to figure out which ones are
correct starting off with two Z we see
that this is something that is x 5 x and
x 7 y in order to equal this term so
this is definitely a right answer now
when we look at five we need to remember
again that invisible multiplication sign
between the five and the X if we
multiply 5 by x + 7 y + 2 Z then we get
this whole term so 5 is also a factor
now one is where things get a little bit
tricky and if you miss this one not a
big deal this actually is a factor of
this term it actually of any term the
reason that one is a factor for any term
we might have whether it's a number or a
variable is because if you multiply 1 by
that term itself you will end up with
the term that you're looking for so in
our case the thing that we need to
multiply 1 by in order to get 5x times 7
1 x 2 Z is just this term itself I know
that might seem a little bit complicated
right now but you'll have plenty of
practice in the upcoming quizzes to sort
this all out bottom line 1 is always a
factor now first you might think that 0
is similar to one in this way but 0 is
actually not a factor here we can't
divide this expression x 0 that would
actually give us a solution that we
don't know how to interpret right now
and there's nothing that we can multiply
by zero in order to get this expression
since 0 times anything is just equal to
0 so 0 should not be checked off we know
that y is x 7 and also x 5 x + 2 z to
come up with this term so we should
check that one off as well and ex works
in the same way so we've checked
everything off except for the zero that
was great i know that factors are a
little bit trickier than terms so i hope
that this vocabulary word is starting to
make a little bit of sense we'll keep
using it really frequently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
