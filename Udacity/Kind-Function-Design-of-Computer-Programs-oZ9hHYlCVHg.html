almost done we just need to implement
kind and to pair
so let's write some tests first as usual
and again I'll do the test for you so
what I've added here is one more card or
one more hand to deal with two pairs
pair of fives and nines with the six
left over and then I pulled out the
ranks of four four of a kind ranks and
two pair ranks by calling card ranks and
then I made these assertions so is there
a four of a kind in the four of a kind
ranks yes there is and in fact it's a
nine there's four nines is there a three
of a kind there no there's not
we're asking for exactly three not at
least three and so there's four but
there's not three is there two of a kind
there no is there one of a kind yes
there is there's four nines and there's
one seven so one one of a kind in four
of a kind ranks is yes there is there's
a seven and then in terms of two pair
does the four of a kind have two pair no
it doesn't so we turn none and does the
two pair have two pair yes it does a
nine and a five now I'm going to ask you
to write the kind function which takes
the end of a kind you're looking for the
list of ranks and it returns the rank
that that hand has exactly enough if
there is one and returns none otherwise
and it should go through the ranks and
left-to-right order and find the first
one that corresponds to n of a kind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
