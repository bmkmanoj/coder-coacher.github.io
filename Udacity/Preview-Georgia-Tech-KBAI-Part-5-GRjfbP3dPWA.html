reasoning meta reasoning is thinking
about thinking knowledge about knowledge
in this case the agent is not reasoning
about something outside in the world
instead the agent is reasoning about
itself but its own knowledge its own
reasoning its own learning as an example
I can ask you what is President Obama's
telephone number I'm sure all of you can
immediately tell me you don't know but
how do you know that you don't know we
test a little bit about matter reasoning
when we were talking about learning by
correcting mistakes there we were
interested in errors in the knowledge
base in journal editors can also be in
reasoning or in learning we'll start
today we're talking about mistakes in
reasoning and learning in addition to
mistakes and knowledge can we talk about
knowledge gaps not just errors in the
knowledge but when some knowledge is
actually missing then we'll talk about a
very journal meta cognitive skill which
leads to strategy selection and
integration in this class we will talk
about a large number of methods but we
haven't yet talked about how an
intelligent agents can put multiple
methods together to address a complex
problem then we will discuss meta meta
reasoning or meta meta meta reasoning
how far can we go finally we will
discuss an example of matter reasoning
an action that is sometimes called goal
this autonomy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
