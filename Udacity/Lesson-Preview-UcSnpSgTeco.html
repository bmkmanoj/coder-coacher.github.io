to provide a brief and high-level
overview of some of the technical
challenges and technologies that are
relevant to today's internet scale
applications that are popular in the
underlying data center systems that
support their execution please note my
emphasis in brief and high-level the
space of data center technologies is so
vast and so dynamic that there is no way
we can cover it in sufficient technical
depth in just one lesson in fact there
are a number of courses at Georgia Tech
that devote a substantial percentage of
their content to these topics instead
what I want to achieve with this lesson
is to make sure I provide you with some
context so that you can understand how
some of the mechanisms that were
discussed earlier in this course apply
to those problems to those technologies
that are in popular use today
specifically we will describe the
typical multi-tier architectures for
supporting internet scale services and
applications in their related management
challenges next we will talk about cloud
computing we will explain what it is and
what is the role that it plays in
addressing the limitations of some of
these traditional approaches and finally
we will briefly comment on some of the
key technologies that shape the cloud
computing clan scale in that enable us
with scale and flexibility in how we
process large amounts of information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
