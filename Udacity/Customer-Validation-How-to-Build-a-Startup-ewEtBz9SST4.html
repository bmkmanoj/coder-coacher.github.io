searching for a business model and
that's customer validation by now to get
to this step we assumed you believe you
have product market fit now you would
say okay now I get hire people not going
to like run my million-dollar Google
AdWords campaign and we say no not
really we don't really think you have
enough evidence to do so we kind of hear
you that you believe you do so we're
going to do this again but this time
trying to get orders or users or both
depending on what your business model
said so phase one is you're going to get
ready to sell if it's a physical product
you're going to develop sales collateral
meaning the data sheets and price lists
and demos etc if it's a web and mobile
product you're going to try to acquire
and activate customers and you're going
to build a high fidelity Minimum Viable
Product which is fancy word for your
website or mobile app will look like
it's almost done maybe the help files
aren't there etc and maybe not all the
features but the core features that
people will use and then you get out of
the building physically or virtually and
you try to get out and sell and see if
you get users or payers or both the
other thing you'll be doing
simultaneously with this is develop
positioning which is a fancy word for
saying okay I now have a lot of customer
feedback how could have I best describe
this based on what the customers are
actually telling me because you'll ask
so I explained it to you like this
how could I have said it better and and
if you actually listen to them they
actually would have said yeah you know I
ignored the first seven things you said
but when you said number eight that's
what I really got interested in excited
and so you're going to develop a both
corporate or company and product
positioning and you're going to do this
way before you ever spend money on
external PR agencies by actually
listening to your own customers and then
in phase four you're going to verify or
repeat and you're going to see if you're
ready to start scaling sales and
marketing spending in customer creation
which is the most expensive part of a
startup this customer validation stage
actually gets you out and you pretend
you have the world's largest sales force
and you're ready to go okay I think it's
really going to work because I've tested
it in customer discovery and most of the
time you find out oops
I really didn't quite understand what
those customers were saying and instead
of being out of business because you
spent all your money on Salesforce or
Google AdWords campaigns or customer
acquisition you now have the cash and
time to simply go back from phase four
and go back and pivot and say I clearly
didn't understand something about my
customer segments or features or
customer needs or how to do customer
relationships etc and so customer
validation in its detail again has two
tracks one for physical a one for web
mobile get ready to sell sell to early
customers who we call early Vangelis
develop positioning and again either
pivot or proceed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
