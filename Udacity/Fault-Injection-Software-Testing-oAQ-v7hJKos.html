problem and in practice there are a
couple of different ways to do with it
the first way doesn't actually have
anything to do with testing but it's
such good advice that I can't resist
giving it and the advice is that you
should always try to use low level
programming languages or interfaces that
are predictable and that return friendly
error codes now what I mean is basically
given a choice between using the UNIX
system call interface which has all of
these unfriendly features that we were
just talking about and using the Python
libraries you'd almost always choose the
Python libraries because they are far
friendlier behavior and they have far
fewer obscure error codes of course we
don't always have the option of doing
this we probably can't implement a full
with lines web browser in Python and
expect it to run really quickly and be
fully featured so we're forced to use
this these these bad style api's
sometimes now from a testing point of
view we can often use a technique called
fault injection to deal with these kind
of problems so let's assume for the
moment that we're using the Python
library to create a file so we're gonna
be issuing a call like open slash temp
slash true that's a path to the file
we're trying to open and W specifies
their opening that file with right
permissions so now if our Python
application issues this call we might
have a fairly hard time testing the case
where the open call fails because on
most machines there's going to be a
directory called slash temp and so this
call might almost always succeed so we
can do instead is call a different
function my open here in this case with
an identical as an identical interface
to the open system to the open call and
in fact not only is the interface
identical but its implementation is also
almost identical so most of the time
what my open is going to do is simply
call open so we have is a stub function
that's almost functionally equivalent to
open but the key difference is we wrote
the code from my open and what we can do
with this is conditionally inside the my
open code we can sometimes cause the
open consistent call to fail and again
this is called fault injection and it's
a fairly common testing technique so in
practice you have to be pretty careful
with fault injection so one thing that
can happen is if you make my open fail
too often like for example it fails 50%
of the time then a program that's using
it probably will never get off the
ground a large-sized program that opens
a lot of files will almost never succeed
in opening all of them and so we're not
actually going to get to executing the
interesting part of the file so one
thing we might do in my open
is have it initially succeed maybe for
the first 100 calls and after that it
might do something like fail 1% of the
time so that's just an example in
practice we would have to experiment
with what kind of failure rates are good
at testing the system but we're actually
the software that's actually under test
and so let's just take a quick quiz over
this material so the quiz is faults
injected into some software no test
should be first all possible faults
second none and third faults that we
want our code to be robust with respect
