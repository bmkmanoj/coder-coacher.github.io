expressions describe regular languages
remember that officially a language is a
set of strings these grammars that we've
been introducing describe something new
context-free languages for now
context-free just means that if you have
a rule a can be replaced by be in your
grammar and you have an a you can
replace it with a B regardless of what
this nearby context is as long as you
hold the context the same so if I can
use the rule now I can also use it if
there's no X on one side no Z on the
other if there's nothing on the left if
there's nothing on the right if they're
flying monkeys on the left and flying
monkeys on the right regardless of the
context I can apply this rule the set of
languages that can be described by
rewrite rules or grammars like this are
called context-free languages all the
formal grammars we are going over
describe context-free languages a more
powerful set of strings than our old
friends the regular languages here I've
drawn a little chart showing three
different regular expression forms and
the corresponding context-free grammar
forms on the right if you had a regular
expression concatenation regular
expression a followed by regular
expression B we could build a grammar
that did the same thing just by putting
a and B next to each other on the right
hand side if you had a star regular
expression a star we could do the same
thing the same effect of having zero or
more A's with two rules either we have
nothing or we have an a followed by zero
or more A's finally here we have regular
expression disjunction or choice either
a or b that's easy to write with two
separate grammar rules G goes to a or G
goes to B so for all three of these
cases and regular expressions there's
something corresponding we can do in the
world of context-free grammars now I
haven't shown you how to do something
like a plus but remember that a plus is
just a a star and I've already shown you
how to do concatenation and the star so
in theory you could compose it over here
well so at this point it might seem like
regular expressions and context-free
grammars are equal but they are not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
