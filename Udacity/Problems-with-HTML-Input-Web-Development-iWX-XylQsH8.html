practice so here we are in our editor
here's our form HTML we're gonna have to
edit this to make it a little bit more
complex and I'm going to put in a few
new lines as well to make it a little
bit easier to read so I'm done editing
the HTML I've actually only made a
fairly small change but I put some new
lines in here so we can read it so now
we've got label the string month which
is what it said before in our input
field and I've added this new value
parameter for for a month and I've added
another one for day and another one for
a year and we're gonna pass these values
in to our function below so that our
form renders extra values
okay so let's edit the function below
and put this whole thing together we're
gonna edit now our write form function
we're already passing an error let's add
in the other parameters so I'm adding
the extra parameters and they're all
going to have defaults to blank month
day and year nothing crazy about that
and let's also edit our dictionary that
we pass into the form to use these
variables we've updated the dictionary
now we're passing these variables into
this dictionary which gets passed into
our form string and so now whenever we
write the form or our form function our
write form function can take extra
variables to populate the form let's
make sure everything still works the way
it did before before we go ahead and
call this function here we are in our
browser let's type in some junk submit
our form and see if everything works
okay we didn't our we didn't get an
exception nothing broke so we're in good
shape let's go ahead and get these
fields part populated here's our new
write form function here's our post
function here we've got our three
variables that represent what the user
entered we're getting them from the
request here let's edit our post
function - to use these new variables
now we're going to restructure this a
little bit because right now we're
calling valid month on the request
parameters and and if one of these
parameters is invalid we're just going
to get you know false back and that's
not what we want so we need to change
just a little bit so let's let's get rid
of let's let's restructure this so I got
rid of our calls to valid month day and
year and user monstrous equals what the
user actually entered in for a month day
and year and then I'm going to use
different variables to test their
validity and I'll add those now okay
so I separated the the calling of valid
Montagne
year from fetching the the parameter out
of the request and this is so we can
have both variables that represent
whether the the values are valid or not
and also variables that represent what
the user actually entered because we may
have to reuse those okay so let's change
our validity check now to use the proper
variables
okay I've changed our validity check
here to make sure we're using month day
and year now those variables instead of
user month day and year and now let's
change our call to write form and now
I've entered now I'm passing in the
strings that the user originally entered
into our form so that when we have an
error will render the form with the
whatever the user typed in let's give
this a shot in production so we've got
our form let's type in some let's type
in some junk when we submit our form now
what we should see is an error message
and our form fields should still have
our values in it there we go so it
doesn't even look like our form was
rerender because all that appeared was
our error message that's pretty neat huh
and let's make sure that submitting
correct answer still works okay so we're
gonna enter in real data this is gonna
go through our validators and let's
submit this form success so it rejected
our bad form and it accepted our good
for them that's pretty cool so I've
entered in a normal day in a normal year
but in the month I've entered in a quote
and and you know some more text what's
going to happen when I click the submit
button are we going to see an error
message and our and our inputs will be
in the form you know our normal error
behavior we'll see an error message but
the quote messes up our HTML will we
caused an error on the server side or
the page this render blank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
