good sense of what the various
transforms do 3j s supports these basic
transforms without you needing to
understand what's going on inside the
code
however 3j s can't provide every
possible type of transform out there
though it tries more importantly you'll
need to know more about how transforms
are coded if you want to program the
vertex and pixel shaders in the pipeline
here's a screen shot of the contents of
the forearm object 3d from the robot arm
demo using the debugger
you have been using the debugger in your
browser right if not please go look at
the additional course materials right
now and learn more about it if you dig
inside any object 3d you'll see a
parameter called matrix it is a matrix 4
with a bunch of numbers in it ultimately
this matrix parameter is what holds the
transform that changes the object's
shape orientation and location when you
set the position rotation and scale
these all affect what gets stored in
this array this matrix represents all
these transforms put together in a tidy
package we can multiply a coordinate
represented by a pointer vector by this
matrix and get a new coordinate that's
honestly it in a nutshell any object we
make is ultimately represented by a
bunch of points these points are in the
object's own sort of space for example
if we make a cube using cube geometry
its centered around the origin we
transform the cubes points by a
transform matrix to move rotate and
scale it as desired a transform matrix
is a four by four set of numbers 3gs
also supports a matrix three type which
almost no one uses in math in general a
matrix can have any dimensions at all
such as 12 by 38 the four by four matrix
is the size that the GPU prefers we can
multiply a coordinate by a matrix this
is shown by putting the coordinate to
the right of the matrix the new
resulting coordinate is put to the left
of the equal sign the mathematical
notation is shown here the coordinate
times the matrix gives this new
coordinate to multiply a coordinate by a
matrix you take the coordinate and
perform a dot product with each row of
the matrix for example the dot product
of the first row and the coordinate is
this d 1 equals n1 1 times C 1 plus n 2
1 times C 2 and so on the sum of all
these four terms is the first coordinate
of the result the dot product of the
second row and the coordinate gives D 2
the second coordinate of the result
after four dot products you have a new
coordinate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
