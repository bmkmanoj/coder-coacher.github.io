algorithms let's look back to the
algorithm that Alice was using to solve
her problem which was the whole point of
us learning about algorithm analysis in
the first place so here again is the
algorithm that Alice was using it's
those five lines here and although we
already noticed that it's a running time
that grows exponentially we don't really
yet have the precise running time stated
in our notation so in order to do this
let's look at the individual lines and
see how often they are executed and then
as a little quiz I will ask you to
figure out the running time of Alice
algorithm using notation so let's start
with line one and line one is just an
assignment of a value so that's actually
it takes zero time steps but we can also
just say that takes Oh of one time steps
which just means that it's some constant
although in this case the constant is
zero but oh of one is a general notation
to keep in mind anytime you want to
state that an algorithm runs in constant
time you can just write over one now
line number two when we have n
communication centers so n is going to
be the size of the input in this case
then we already figured it out at the
beginning that this line here is going
to be executed Oh of 2 to the power of n
times when I'm going to use this
notation here which you might not be
familiar with to say that n here is the
exponent so what about line number 3 so
line number three is going to be called
each time that this loop here execute so
each time the loop of lines 2 3 4 and 5
execute we're going to call this
function here now the question is how
long does it take us to check if an
assignment of 0 and 1 values is valid so
if you have a network that has n
communication centers then in theory
each communication center can be
connected to any other communication
center so you have n communication
centers and the question is how many
connections can they have between each
other so this one could be connected to
this one this one here this one here
and so on and basically checking of an
assignment of 0 and 1 values is valid
means checking for each cable between
two communication centers whether at
least one of the communication centers
is assigned a one so the running time of
checking if the whole assignment of 0
and 1 values is valid depends on the
total number of cables so the question
here is what is the maximum number of
cables that we can have and that is
actually very similar to the running
time of the algorithm that you analyzed
in the quiz a few minutes ago because
the first communication center can be
connected to n minus 1 other
communication centers then the second
one it can also be connected to n minus
1 other centers but of course we don't
want to double count or actually it
doesn't really matter if we double count
or not because we're using our notation
but if we don't double count then it's
just n minus 2 cables here and this goes
on and on and on and from the algorithm
that you analyze before when we were
discussing our notation you already know
that if you do the sum of n minus 1 n
minus 2 n minus 3 and so on until you
get down to one then that is 0 of n
squared the worst-case running time for
checking if in a given assignment is
valid means going through o of N squared
different cables and then for each of
those cables checking if one of the
communication centers that it's attached
to is has been assigned at one now to
figure out the running time of this line
here of course we first know it so of N
squared cables and then the question is
how much time do we need to check an
individual cable but for now I think
without further discussion we can assume
that it's constant time because it's
just connected to two communication
centers so there's probably an efficient
way that we can implement this if you
were to prove the actual running time of
course you would have to have a more
detailed discussion here but for now
we'll just say each time this line here
is executed it takes Oh of N squared
time now what about line number for each
time this line is executed we have to do
the sum of all the ones in the
assignment and now the assignment
concerns the communication centers so we
have to go through n communication
centers and count how many ones be fined
so each time this line is executed it
will take Oh of n
time which is linear time and finally
line number five it's taking the minimum
of the best possible solution we have
found so far and the number of devices
we have in the current solution to
figure out if the current solution is a
better solution than the one that we
already have but this of course takes
only constant time because it does not
depend on the size of the input it
always takes two values and produces a
minimum so as announced as our next quiz
I would like you to take this
information and figure out what the
overall running time of Alice's
algorithm will be given a network of n
communication centers so which of these
six possibilities is the correct running
time of Alice's algorithm above</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
