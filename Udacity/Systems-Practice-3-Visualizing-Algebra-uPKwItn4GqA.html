wondering how many tickets were sold how
many adult tickets and how many kid
tickets so these must be the variables
we can let a equal the number of adult
tickets and we can let k equal the
number of kid tickets it doesn't matter
what variables you use you could use a
smiley face or even a diamond it just
matters that use the same variable for
the number you're representing
throughout the problem these are the two
equations we need to set up the number
of adult tickets and the number of kid
tickets should equal our total number of
tickets using our variables I have a
plus K is equal to 500 500 was the total
number of tickets sold for the
fundraiser the second equation involves
the amount of money earned from adult
tickets and the amount of money earned
from kid tickets if we add those two
amounts together we should get the total
amount of money which was 3312 dollars
and fifty cents I've written our two
equations down here and this time I'm
going to solve it using elimination we
don't always have to use substitution
I'm going to multiply this equation
through by a negative 4 so I can end up
eliminating the case here are the two
equations and I can solve this equation
for K this allows me to do substitution
that can plug in 500 minus a in 4k now
we don't always need to do substitution
I could have multiplied this first
equation by a negative 4 and that would
have let me eliminated the case I could
have solved it using elimination instead
either way you do it you should wind up
with the same answer in the end first I
distribute the positive for to the 500
and the negative a then I combine like
terms and subtract two thousand our last
step is to divide by the coefficient of
a three and a half and we get a is equal
to 375 this was the number of adult
tickets that were sold for the
fundraiser we know the total number of
tickets must add up to 500 so i can
replace a with 375 to find the number of
kit tickets using some mental math here
or an equation we can get k is equal to
125 this is the number of kid tickets we
sold and to be sure that your answers
are right plug them in into your second
equation to make sure that the amounts
add up to 3312 dollars and fifty cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
