applications in a benchmark suite how do
we summarize the overall performance of
a machine on the entire suite so we want
a single number that represents the
performance of the machine usually we
want to use something like the average
execution time so let's say we have a
computer X and the computer Y a
benchmark application a B and C and
let's say that computer X takes nine
seconds here ten seconds here and five
seconds here whereas the computer whai
takes 18 seconds here
seven seconds here and 11 seconds here
the speed-up of machine x over machine y
on each of these applications is two for
application a because x is doing it in
half the time as Y zero point seven on
application B because X is actually
slower than Y there and here each to
point two because X is more than twice
as fast as Y now let's compute the
average execution time here we have 9
plus 10 plus 5 over 3 gives us 8 seconds
so on average computer X finishes one of
these three applications in 8 seconds on
average computer Y finishes one of these
3 in 18 plus 7 plus 11 over 3 12 seconds
if we now compute the speed-up of x over
Y on average it will be 1.5
when computed this way but if we average
the speedups here we get 1 point 63 so
if you want to use average execution
times we cannot simply average the
speedups
on individual applications to get the
average speed up pretty much the
speed-up using average execution times
is not the same as the average of speed
ups on these individual applications if
we want to be able to average speed ups
then we need to use geometric means for
both of our application execution times
and for our speed ups in that case we
get a geometric mean of 7 point 66 here
11.15 here and 1 point 4 5 6 here so we
have used the
metric mean for the execution times for
each of the computer if we use the
geometric mean for these speed ups we
will get the same value here the
geometric mean is computed by
multiplying out for example nine times
ten times five and then taking the nth
root in this case third root of the
value to get the geometric mean and
because things are being multiplied out
and then the nth root taken you can see
how if we divide these things we will
get that the speed-up computed geometric
means of execution times will be the
same as the mean of the speedups
because we have third root of 18 times 7
times 11 these two divided is the same
as third root of 9 over 18 times 10 over
7 times 5 over 11 so as you can see this
is the geometric mean of execution times
then we can compute the speed-up using
them and that's the same as the
geometric mean of individual speed ups
however this only works for geometric
means we do prefer average execution
time when we are computing the average
times however just you must be careful
not to compute individual speed ups and
then average them instead you should be
computing the average execution times
and then computing the speed-up using
those averages you should also remember
that simple average should not be used
on ratios of times so basically a speed
up here is a ratio of two times we
should not be using a simple arithmetic
mean on these values because their
ratios geometric means on the other hand
can be used on ratios but for this to
work we also have to reserve metric mean
on times two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
