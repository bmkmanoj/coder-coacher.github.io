the pieces inside are in sealed little
bags larger sets like this one have
multiple sealed bags all of the pieces
in one bag create just a portion or
component of the model after building
each of the components you can combine
them together to form the completed
model an angular module is just like
this cardboard box it's a container that
houses all of the different components
of an angular application if the box is
like a module then this bag might be a
controller and this little bag could be
the router or a service applications
aren't limited to just one module when
an application becomes more complex it's
a good idea to break out the different
features of the application into modules
this keeps your app more organized
manageable and easier to test when we
used yeoman to generate our app we gave
it the name you decimals this became the
default module for the app the generator
creates the apps model inside app j/s a
module is created by calling angular
module passing it the name of the module
which can be anything but automatically
uses the name provided on the terminal
and passing it an array of dependencies
remember that angular applications can
have more than one module if this app
depended on other modules then those
modules are required for this app to
function those modules names would be
listed here so this tells angular to
create the Udacity meals app module and
that it depends on DEP 1 and depth to
this tells angular to create the Udacity
meals at module and that it doesn't
depend on any other modules so this
creates the module to get the module we
would write angular dot module and give
it the name of the module we want to get
these two forms are very similar but do
totally different things if you're
creating a module make sure you pass an
array is the second argument even if the
module does not depend on anything it
needs to have that array also make sure
that you create your module before you
try getting it or angular will complain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
