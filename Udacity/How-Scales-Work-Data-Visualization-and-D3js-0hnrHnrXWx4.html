some live coding the functions in d3
that actually help us produce and
manipulate scales for now I want to talk
from still a relatively high level and
using a lot of graphics to help explain
what's happening behind the scenes this
green rectangle here represents the
scale of the life expectancy of the
Gapminder plot we see at the bottom
there's a minimum value of 15 and at the
top is a maximum value of 90 the Green
Square on the Left represents the value
of our data in this case the actual
numeric representation of what the life
expectancy is and this blue rectangle
represents what pixel values we want to
map the data values to d3 refers to the
input values as the domain of your data
often represented by the minimum value
and the maximum value but the domain
actually refers to the entire extent
between the min in the max and d3 refers
to the pixel values you want to map the
domain to the range also represented by
a minimum and a maximum value in order
to transform our domain into the range
we often have to specify what type of
function we would like to use to convert
the values from the data into pixel
values in the case of the life
expectancy the scale was linear in the
Gapminder plot so we want to use a
linear function to map the domain values
to the range in the very mathematical
sense and literal sense of a function
that maps from our domain into our range
we can think of the transform that
converts the values from our domain in
the data to pixel values as an equation
in this case mapping the domain as X
into the range as Y since we are using a
linear scale the function is simply the
equation of a line you do not have to
worry with the value of M or the value
of B R in this case that is one of the
very nice conveniences that
III provides for us all we need to
specify are the minimum and the maximum
of our domain and the minimum and the
maximum of where we wanna map our values
to and the d3 scale function figures out
the appropriate values and constants for
the linear function that map's the
domain into the range so far we haven't
actually specified the values we want to
map our domain into for the live coding
example we will get into we will simply
pick a Max and min for the range in our
case we can simply set a Max and min of
where we want our output range to be in
this case I chose a maximum of 200
pixels since that's around the size of
the box we would be working with on the
webpage a minimum range value of 0 does
not mean we plot our point in one of the
corners of our webpage it's simply an
offset from the root SVG element which
we will be working with one last quirk I
want to cover is that the coordinate
plane in the SVG in the web page
actually has a value of 0 at the top
left and as you go out right from that
origin X values are increasing and as
you go down from the origin Y values are
increasing so a value of 0 actually
corresponds to the upper left and a
y-value of 200 actually will correspond
to the bottom of our SVG element now
that we have some conceptual idea of why
d3 scales are important and how to map
data values into pixel values to display
on the screen we can get into some live
code and actually see this put into
practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
