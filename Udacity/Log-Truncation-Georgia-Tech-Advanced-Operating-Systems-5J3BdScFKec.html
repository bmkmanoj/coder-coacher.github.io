have crashes but hopefully crashes are
not something that happened very often
and if crashes don't happen that often
crash recovery is not that important but
on the other hand if crashes are not
happening but the system is progressing
along then what is going to happen is
that we're going to create lots of log
records on the disk as the system is
making forward progress so we have
external data segments which of course
we need because that is where the
persistent objects are actually
contained but we're also creating these
redo log records there are reflections
of changes that we made to the in-memory
versions of these persistent data
structures eventually one these redo
logs that represent changes to the
external data segment we apply to the
external data segments now the only time
we're going to do that is when the crash
happens that's being very pessimistic
also we may end up clogging the disk
with a number of redo log records we've
seen the need for log truncation in the
distributed shared memory systems as
well in the case of DSM those logs were
clogging physical memory in the case of
lrvm these logs are clogging the disk
space regardless these are unnecessary
overhead in terms of space and clutter
and also if a particular application
needs to map an external data segment
then we have to know whether that data
segment is up-to-date or not and that
depends on whether there are some redo
logs pending to be applied to those
external data segments so all of these
things suggest that what we need to do
is truncate the log periodically what
exactly is truncating the log it means
that we want to read the logs from the
disk and apply them to the external data
segments and get rid of them now this
sounds exactly like what I described to
you happens when we do recovery from a
crash therefore for log truncation
simply apply crash recovery algorithm so
anytime the system meaning the lrvm
runtime decides that it is time to do
some cleanup what it is going to do is
it's gonna go and pick some logs to
clean bring those logs into memory read
the redo log records apply them to the
appropriate data segment and throw away
the log records so that's what log
truncation is all about of course we
don't want to stop the world in order to
do this log truncation so what we want
to do is we want to do the log
truncation in parallel with forward
processing by the application and the
way lrvm allows that to happen is it
splits the log record in two epochs it
says this is a portion of the log record
that I've chosen to clean up and this is
a truncation epoch and so this is a part
that I'm going to use to read from the
disk and apply to the external data
segment and in parallel with that I'm
going to allow the application to make
changes this is a current epoch where
the application is making changes to the
log record and then the new record which
is not yet being used so the idea is
that we are allowing our VM to do its
work in terms of log truncation by
reading a portion of this log which is a
truncation epoch portion of the log and
applying to the external data segments
and in parallel with that we're also
allowing the application to make forward
progress by writing new log records to
the current epoch so the crash recovery
algorithm is being applied to the part
of the log that is in this truncation
epoch while allowing for word processing
to the part of the log which is the
current epoch that the server is working
on the biggest challenge in implementing
lrvm is the log truncation corner
because there's so much coordination
that is needed between what the lrvm
runtime has to do and what the
application may be doing in terms of
morphing the current log segment you
need the log segment for recovery but it
is also an overhead when there are no
crashes and they take up a lot of disk
space and put extra burden on mapping an
external data segment to the sub system
that wants to use it so managing
the logs truncating the log as
efficiently as possible is one of the
hairiest problems according to the
authors of this paper in implementing
lrvm because it directly has a
consequence on the performance of lrvm
and in fact the bulk of the heavy
lifting that has done in implementing
lrvm runtime and make it really
lightweight and efficient goes in doing
this log truncation efficiently now what
I described you here is one coarse level
of log truncation where we are taking
the redo logs and applying it and we'll
find a grain way of implementing log
truncation would be to look at in-memory
copy of the log segment also and trying
to make sure that we applied to the
external data segments so that we don't
even incur the cost of writing and this
version of the redo log that is even
more complicated and I welcome you to
read details of that in the paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
