configuration would work in detail
recall our metaphor of representin
reason we represent knowledge and reason
over it so suppose the task is to
configure a chair we must then somehow
represent our knowledge of this chair so
that we can reason over it so when we
represent our knowledge of the chair in
the form of a frame here is the frame
here are the various slots for the time
being let's just assume that has six
slots that are important the last photo
the slots may point to their own frames
so there might be a frame four legs a
frame for seat and so on now some of
these frames have slots like size and
material and cost for legs we may have
an additional slot like count what is
the number of legs in the chair and this
particular frame representation captures
our knowledge of the generic
prototypical chair to do configuration
design is to come up with a specific
arrangement of all the parts to this
particular chair to assign values to
each of the variables which means
filling out the fillers for each of the
slums of course the values of these
variables depends in part on the global
constraints of mass and costs we may for
example have a global constraint and a
mass of the chair or on the cost of the
chair or both we may have additional
constraints as well for example in
Machida love the chair might be given
perhaps the material needs to be metal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
