think about this wait how old are my
children let's see what their adult
height is going to be I would expect
them to be a little bit smaller than me
a little bit smaller than you so so
they're the average height their average
height of your children you would you
say it would be like an average height
person or like your height or sort of in
between in between in between alright so
it turns out that if you actually do
this you measure people's Heights and
you measure the heights of their
children that that is in fact what you
tend to see that very very tall people
like you tend to have taller than
average children but the height is
between it actually regresses to the
mean and here we really do mean
regresses in the sense of going back to
this kind of more primitive state that
if you think about average height people
as being like your ancestors then you
know you as a very tall person that tend
to have kids that regress back towards
that average value of that sort of more
older more ancient value so does that
that make some sense to you that makes
some sense but one comment one question
comment that is awesome because I've
always actually wondered what regresses
to the mean actually means but second
what prevents all of us from being
exactly the same height then yeah so
it's what seems to be happening is that
there's a kind of a noisy process and
some people turn out to be taller but
then the next generation there's a
little bit of a history effect and
people stay taller but it tends to drift
back towards the mean so it's so it's
sort of like a random walk to some
extent ah that actually kind of makes
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
