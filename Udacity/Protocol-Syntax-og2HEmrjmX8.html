here's a protocol I'm calling sous-chef
much like a class or a struct definition
it begins with the word protocol
followed by the protocol name and then
in between curly braces we define its
properties and methods this protocol has
no properties and two methods you can
see that the methods aren't implemented
here that's left up to the conforming
type here we just have a list of method
signatures indicating parameters and
return types the next step is for a
class structor enum to adopt the
protocol and the code looks like this
here we have a class called roommate we
want the roommate class to adopt the
sous-chef protocol so an instance of the
roommate class can help make dinner to
adopt the protocol we just type a colon
after the class name and then the name
of the protocol and what does the
compiler have to say here type roommate
does not conform to protocol sous-chef
this message is letting us know that we
still need to implement the methods in
the protocol remember placing the name
sous-chef here is akin to the class
signing a contract to implement the
methods listed by the sous-chef protocol
we still need to fulfill our contract so
here in the roommate class we need to
conform to the sous-chef protocol
meaning we need to write implementations
for the chop and rinse methods they will
each take in a vegetable string and
return a string indicating that they're
sous-chef duties have been fulfilled
soon enough you'll be writing protocols
for your own custom classes still more
often than not you'll be implementing
protocols written by Apple let's
practice the syntax we just learned on a
protocol from the Swift standard library
this protocol is called equitable we can
command click on the protocol name to
see its definition there's a lot of
commenting here but the protocol
actually only has this one method it
takes in two values the left-hand side
and the right hand side of an equality
and returns a bool indicating whether
the two values are equal in other words
with this method in the equitable
protocol we can define what it takes for
two instances of a class to be equal as
you just saw to adopt the protocol we
just type equitable here after the class
name to conform to the protocol we need
to implement this function which is
named with just the equal operator and
we'll say that too in
chances of the class roommate are only
equal if they have the same name and the
same bull value for hungry you'll notice
that I've implemented this function
outside of the class that's because
operators are global functions and now
we can test whether two instances of the
roommate class are equal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
