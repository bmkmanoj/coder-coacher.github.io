database now we just talked about how
kind of a funky database setup we had
but I'll still postgrads and we'll still
use the industry standard cylinders for
representing our databases and these
were you know we had a couple verticals
I think we stored links on one votes on
another comments we're on one and then
it weighed like a miscellaneous one that
we start subreddits and users on the
same LAN or something like a subreddit
or with comments users were with links
when we first built the system is all in
one machine and we have different tables
for each data type and so a natural rate
of grow was just split apart the data
types because remember I talked about
how if you don't do joins scaling is a
lot easier this is an example of that
you know you have to think a little bit
harder about what your queries are going
to be but you can start splitting things
apart do you know how many comments from
the Komets database now something on the
order of like 250 million 250 million
comments when I left I don't remember
how many it was a lot and it wasn't
fitting on one on one machine you know
up links not all of these databases were
replicated we used LAN Desai think do
you guys still use long as we do yeah a
lot of LAN disturb party tool made by
Skype yeah yeah on the Skype guys and
basically what this does is a I think it
does log shipping right no so when you
write to the master it hits a trigger
which then inserts the same query into a
queue and that's replicated to all the
slaves that the same inserts are run on
all the slaves ok so it just it actually
replays the exact commands yeah
obviously like things like random get
pre calculated ok so all of these
machines were replicated using lowest
and longest is really cool and it might
be LAN diste I don't know
that's a problem with what technologies
right what you read about the technology
and like I don't know some people I
think all is hot proxy but it's the
first guy in the office who discovers
the piece of technology he gives inside
how it's pronounced for the rest of the
company we replicate all these machines
both for durability you know so if we
lost the machine you know we would lose
our data I'm right if we lost your
common history you'd be mad and for load
it's spread our reads across all these
machines now remember we talked about
replication lag and I learned this
lesson the hard way and it was really
hard for me to figure that out the first
time because I'd never heard of
replication like I mean it really solve
bugs as a result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
