the vision of active networks reality is
rodeo makers like Cisco are loath to
opening up the network so while the idea
of active networks is very fascinating
that we can be frugal about the
resources that we use in the internet
for different network flows and we can
actually virtualize the physical
infrastructure by slapping on our own
idea what should be the kind of network
flow that I want for my packets seems
very attractive but really it's not
going to be feasible given that we have
to open up the network so it's going to
be feasible only at the edge of the
network secondly when we are using
active networks we are talking about
executing code in a router in order to
determine the routing decision at that
node or in other words we are doing
software routing software routing cannot
match the hardware routing because at
the core of the network there's so much
of traffic being handled that you really
want to do this in hardware and doing
this at software speed is not going to
match the hardware speed of packet
processing in the core of the network so
once again there's argues that active
networks is only feasible at the edge of
the network and finally there are social
and psychological reasons why active
networks may be a little bit hard to
digest it is hard for the user community
to accept arbitrary code executing in a
public routing fabric if my traffic is
flowing through the network and if the
router is going to actually execute some
code in order to do the processing of my
packet that worries me already we talk a
lot about privacy and the fact that in
corporate networks and university
networks you're losing a lot of privacy
people are watching what's going on and
now saying that the routers are going to
do something intelligent or smart
processing packets that might be as
socially and psychologically an
acceptable proposition so these are
reasons why it will make it difficult to
sell the idea of active networks to the
wide area Internet on the other hand the
idea of virtualizing the network flow is
very appealing and if you put together
the two thoughts that I had one is the
idea that you can vote
utilize the network and the second that
active networks is only feasible at the
edge of the network that brings up a
very interesting proposition
which I'm going to mention in my
concluding remarks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
