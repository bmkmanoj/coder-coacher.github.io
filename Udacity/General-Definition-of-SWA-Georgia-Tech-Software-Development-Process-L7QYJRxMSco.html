architecture as the set of principle
design decisions about the system where
principle here implies a degree of
importance that grants the design
decision architectural status and the
point here as we discussed with Nino
early on is that when building a system
we make tons of design decisions and
most of them do not affect the
architecture of the system for example
the fact of choosing a for loop instead
of a while loop in the code or the fact
of deciding that we're going to use data
structure a instead of data structure B
some decisions however do affect the
architecture of the system and in some
cases the distinction between these two
kinds of design decisions is clear in
some other cases it is much faster and
it depends on the context the bottom
line here is that if you believe that
something is an important design
decision that becomes an architectural
decision that is a decision that impacts
a systems architecture in this period we
can see a software architecture as the
blueprint for a software system that we
can use to construct and evolve the
system and the key point about software
architecture is that this blueprint
encompasses every facet of the system
under development it encompasses its
structure of course but not only it also
involves the behavior of the system the
interactions within the system and the
non-functional properties of the system
and we will see how this happens in the
rest of the lesson another important
point about software architecture is
that there is a temporal aspect to it
and the point here is that you don't
build a software architecture in a
single shot but you do it iteratively
over time so basically you go from
having no architecture to your final
architecture so at any point in time
there is a software architecture but it
will change over time and this happens
because design decisions are made are
made and changed over a systems lifetime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
