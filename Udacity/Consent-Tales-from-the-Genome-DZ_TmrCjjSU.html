this guy hold on Lauren before we
actually get DNA from that we need to
take a couple of other steps and a key
thing is before we proceed and get DNA
from that he needs to make sure he's
comfortable with how his DNA and genetic
information will be used by 23 Emmy so
you can read the Terms of Service and
understand how the information will be
used and make that decision on his own
well this sounds like I also probably at
some point need to provide some consent
for other services as well that's true
because in all research a really
important component is informed consent
where the person who's involved in it
understands the risks and benefits of
participation so yes Matt you like all
23 Emmy customers will get it choose
whether you want to take part in
research and have your genetic
information be used for research and
your other other personal information
and so you get to decide whether you
into consent to that use of your
information well I know that informed
consent is a very important aspect of
medicine and research today so if you're
interested in learning more about it you
can visit the American Medical
Association and search for informed
consent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
