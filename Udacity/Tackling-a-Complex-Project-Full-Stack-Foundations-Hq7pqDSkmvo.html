application is having an awesome game
plan let's define what our prototypes
should do after completing each
iteration let's do some brainstorming to
make a checklist of deliverables that we
want to achieve with each iteration of
development by breaking down the project
into smaller easier to manage many
projects in the first pass of this
project will create mock-ups for every
page in the restaurant menu app and
design URLs for each page as well when I
finish this iteration I can show my
designs to my friends or colleagues for
feedback and that's enough work for our
first iteration in the second iteration
you'll set up all the routings for your
application in flask making sure you can
navigate to all of the URLs you want to
create for your application at the end
of this iteration you should be able to
navigate to all of your URLs even if the
pages are not yet created after that you
will build on top of what you made in
the previous iteration by creating all
of your templates and forms and making
sure that they are properly functioning
within your application once you have
created and filled out all of your HTML
templates and see them rendering in your
application we can move on to the next
iteration now that you have a good grasp
of how your front-end code should look
you will add the backend functionality
making sure all of the actions on the
web page are retrieving data from your
database when all of the crud operations
work on all of your web pages you'll be
finished with this iteration you will
then add some in points that allow data
to be sent if the client requests a menu
or specific menu item in JSON farm you
will test these API calls from within
your browser to know you have
successfully finished this step
finally you will add some styling with
CSS JavaScript and a few static images
to give your application and appealing
layout in this step you will also
incorporate message flashing into your
application I chose these steps to
create our application because I feel
they naturally build on top of each
other and have a clear deliverable at
the end of each iteration by keeping
this in mind when you plan future
projects you'll be better prepared for
all kinds of new challenges</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
