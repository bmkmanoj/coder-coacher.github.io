case based reasoning has some
assumptions the first assumption is that
there are patterns to the problems that
agents encountered in the world the same
kinds of problem tend to reoccur again
and again a lot of science is about
finding patterns of regularity in the
world
physics finds patterns of regularity in
the world that are expressed by various
kinds of laws like Newton's second law
of motion presumably if you're going to
build a theory of intelligence that
theory too will give an account of what
kind of patterns exist in the world that
mind that intelligence must encounter
and case based reasoning says one of the
common patterns is that the same kinds
of problem occur again and again and
again so there's a first assumption
second assumption is a similar problems
often have similar solutions here is a
grid of a part of Long Island here is a
grid of part of Dallas Texas now if you
look at the one in Long Island you can
see that if there are two problems which
are very close to each other they are
likely to have very similar solutions
and the same is true for the grid in
Dallas similarly the second assumption
is not always valid it is an example of
it I'm sure all of you know how to tie
your shoelaces but imagine that you buy
a new pair of shoes and this new pair of
shoes have velcro straps now the problem
is very similar how to tighten your
shoes but the solution is radically
different
so shoke another example of this that
comes to mind for me is the example of
touchscreens some of the early
touchscreens could only handle one touch
at a time if you touched it with two
fingers at a time it either wouldn't
register or would only register one of
the touches current touchscreens on
smartphones and tablets that we use
today can handle two or three or four
fingers at a time the problem is very
similar we're still touching a screen
and interacting with it with our fingers
but the solution is actually very very
different it uses a completely different
kind of technology different material
for the screen and a different way of
detecting where the screen is being
touched that's a good example David so
we have at least two examples now where
similar problems can have quite
different solutions nevertheless this
assumption is valid most of the time
most of the time two problems that are
quite similar will end up having two
solutions that are quite similar as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
