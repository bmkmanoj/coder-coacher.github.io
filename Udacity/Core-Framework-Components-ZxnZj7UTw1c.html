recognized him from some other courses
around Udacity everybody it's good to
see you so Cameron we've been working
through stuff with frameworks yes
frameworks are awesome no I love
frameworks there's so much fun you get
to build your app and just think about
the logic of your app without worrying
about all the nuances that go into
making your app work at the lower levels
that's right and frameworks the
developers have already created a bunch
of different you know components that
you can just stick together and so you
don't actually have to worry about any
of that complexity at all yeah it's
fantastic like for instance templating
right usually there's some kind of HTML
that you want to display over and over
or display differently in different
situations and so with templating you
can just define that once say what kind
of information you want to go inside
that template and then when that data
changes on your app the template
automatically changes and it looks great
it's easy you don't have to think about
it so at the end of the day your
workflow is so much faster and more
efficient that's right and another thing
is that they also handle events so you
don't actually have to worry about add
event listener or managing state with
the Dom richest that's awesome that's
great yeah there's so much you don't
have to worry about because you have
like the best developers in the world
usually working on these things maybe
that's a bit of an exaggeration but
they're really good and they know what
they're doing and so you are not really
building this app by yourself you're
building on top of their expertise which
means that your app is going to be more
performant and there's a lot that you
just don't have to do which is great
that is great yeah less work is better
definitely you the best code or the code
that has the least chance of being a bug
is the code that you don't write exactly
smell you better way of seeing that but
you get the yeah exactly yeah okay so
we're looking at angular and ember and
some other frameworks in this course but
each framework is different each one
provides its own set of benefits and
attractions so there are lots of
different things you need to keep in
mind as you're looking for a framework
yeah everyone is slightly different they
all have their own different philosophy
you know they all have their way of
doing things and they also have
different features usually sets of
features are fairly similar but there
can be some differences so it's
definitely worth experimenting with
different frameworks to see which one
you like more and then when it comes
time to build your project it's worth
thinking about what's going to go into
it so you can make the best decision
which framework best fits your needs
sometimes there's not necessarily a best
framework it's just what you're most
comfortable with and you know what you
think you can move the fastest with
