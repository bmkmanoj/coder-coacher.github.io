the denominator so we can make a better
approximation for our answer we can use
the square root of 10 / 5 to help us
approximate the answer for this
expression I don't know what it really
means to divide by root 5 but i can
approximate this by dividing by 5 we
know the square root of nine equals
three so the square root of 10 is just a
little bit more than three we're going
to approximate it though and just use
three so root 10 / 5 is about
three-fifths or six tenths if we would
have left this expression as it was we
would have had to divide by a
nonterminating decimal divided by the
square root of five is much more
challenging than doing this
approximation as we work through this
unit will be taking denominators that
contain radicals and changing them into
integers or other expressions that don't
contain radicals for square roots this
is pretty simple we can just multiply
the numerator and denominator by the
exact radical that appears in the
denominator then we just multiply
radicals together and simplify if
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
