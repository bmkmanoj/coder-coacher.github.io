the different types of program
discontinuities that I mentioned
exokernel maintains the PE data
structure on behalf of each library
operating system so for example this PE
data structure corresponds to this
library operating system this PE data
structure corresponds to this library
operating system and the PE data
structure contains the entry points in
the library operating system for dealing
with the different kinds of program
discontinuities for example exceptions
that are thrown by the currently
executing process has a specific entry
point in the library operating system
and similarly external interrupts are
going to be handled by interrupt
handlers that have specific entry points
in the library operating system and a
process may make system calls and if it
makes system calls there is a protected
entry context which is the entry point
in a library operating system for system
calls that are made by the currently
running process that belongs to that
specific library operating system this
last entry may correspond to the
addressing context that is the location
of the handler for page fault service
there in the library operating system so
in a nutshell this PE data structure
that is unique for every library
operating system contains the handler
entry points for different types of
events that are fielded by exokernel in
this sense the PE and The Associated
exokernel action of calling the
appropriate handler entry point when a
particular event is triggered is very
similar to the event handler mechanism
that we discussed in the spin operating
system in addition to the PE data
structure we already mentioned the
software TLB that exokernel maintains on
behalf of every operating system so this
isn't software TLB for OS one software
TLB for os/2 and these are
what are called the guaranteed mappings
in other words I mentioned that on a
context which exokernel when it goes
from one operating system to another it
saves the current TLB in the hardware
the hardware tlb in the software TLB
that is associated with this particular
operating system and here is where this
entry point is important
this actually is specifying two
exokernel the set of guaranteed mappings
that a particular library operating
system wants exokernel to maintain on
its behalf
every time it is scheduled and that's
the set of TLB entries that are dumped
into the software TLB data structure at
the point of a context switch now all of
the hardware TLB entries but only the
entries that have been guaranteed to be
kept on behalf of a particular operating
system are dumped into the software TLB
data structure and those are the ones
that'll be repopulated into the hardware
TLB when the same operating system is
scheduled on the hardware i mentioned an
external interrupt as another source of
discontinuity for the currently
executing process well note that an
external interrupt may not always be for
the currently scheduled operating system
it may be for some other operating
system maybe this operating system
scheduled at disk i/o and the disk i/o
got complete and that interrupts that
came in to exokernel is on behalf of
this operating system and not the
process that is currently executing on
the CPU for this operating system
exokernel has to have a way of
associating the interrupt that is coming
in was a correct operating system which
is expecting it downloading code into
the kernel which i mentioned is one of
the mechanisms that exokernel provides
allows first level interrupt handling on
behalf of a library operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
