value of a state is called its utility
and it's just a number so we're at the
end of the game and if there's one state
where we win we'll give that a utility
of one and if there's another state
where we lose we'll give that a utility
of 0 and now if I have a choice here
it's my turn to move I have a choice to
go either way I'm going to maximize my
choice and I'm going to move there and
that means the utility of this state is
going to be 1 because i know i can get 1
by taking the optimal strategy and we
keep backing up the tree that way that's
if it was my choice here if it was my
opponents choice and they could go in
either way then my opponents going to
minimize my score maximize their score
and go in this direction forcing me to
lose and allowing them to win so we'll
stay the utility of this state is 0 for
me and I want to also introduce here
another idea called the quality which is
a function on a state and in action and
gives us a number a utility number and
so that's saying what's the quality of
this action in this particular state so
if these were the actions hold and roll
then we'd say for my opponent the
quality of rolling from this state would
would give us this utility and the
quality of holding would give us this
utility and finally if it was the dices
turn and let's say there are six
outcomes but three of them lead to this
date and free of them lead to this state
then from the dice we're going to
average over all the possibilities so
it's half of one and half of zero so the
utility of this state is one-half so now
we have a way if we know the value of
the end states which is defined by the
game defined by when we win and lose and
how many points each player gets for
that now we have a way of essentially
searching backwards to say from the end
state I can go backwards and say what's
the value of one of my moves oh I know
that it's the maximum what's the value
of my opponents I know that it's a
minimum what's the value of a random
dice roll I know that it's the average
and now we could go all the way back
backing up the tree to say what's the
value of this start state and I can
collect those values and I can have a
utility for this start state and we'll
see in the game of pig the start state
for the first player has a little bit
better than fifty percent chance just
because they go first for the game we
defined I think it works out to about
fifty four percent point five for
utility for the player who goes first
and we can also work out the quality for
each of these moves we can work out
what's the quality of rolling from the
state and what's the quality of holding
from this state and then the optimal
strategy is just the one that says
choose the move which has the highest
quality if role has the highest quality
from this state then that's the move
that we should do so just as we did in
search we're refining our way from the
start to the goal we can do that with
random problems but we have to find a
way not to just one individual outcome
but to all the outcomes that were
covered by all the possibility of the
dice so the complications going to be
more complex but the idea is the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
