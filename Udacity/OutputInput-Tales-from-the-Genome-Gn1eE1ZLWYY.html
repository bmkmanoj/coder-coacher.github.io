region of the ABO gene we can take a
small region and see how it is turned
from DNA into protein by plugging into
our genetic code and coming up with
those amino acids now the interesting
thing is not everybody has the same
sequence for the ABO gene some people
have a different letter at position 796
so this is position 7 93 and 94 95 this
would be positioned 796 this see the
cytosine right here some people have a
cytosine but not everybody so one person
has a variation where that position 796
is changed to an A and another person
has a variation where that position 796
cytosine is changed to a tee I want you
to tell me which variant you think would
have a more significant change compared
to this original sequence that we showed
up here remember make you see your
genetic code here that's given on the
screen if this is too small or you can't
read it well then you can also click on
the link in the instructors notes to see
the full version of the genetic code
again I want you to select which variant
you think is a more significant change
and then I want you to explain why you
think that is in this text box right
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
