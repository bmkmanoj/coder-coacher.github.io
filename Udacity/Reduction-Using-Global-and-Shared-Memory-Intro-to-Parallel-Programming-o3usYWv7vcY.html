showing the memory traffic required for
the global version here I'm showing the
memory traffic required from the shared
version I'm showing all the reads you
need to do in red and all the rights you
need to do and blue and if you sum this
series you'll find for reducing n values
and shared memory you'll do in reads and
one right but for global memory you do
two in reads and n writes so you would
expect that it would run faster which it
will let's show that now so now I'm
going to run the shared memory version
and we see that it does in fact run
faster now we're down to 400 64
microseconds as opposed to 651 but it
doesn't run three times faster how come
well the detailed reason is that we're
not saturating the memory system and
there's numerous advanced techniques you
would need to do to totally max out the
performance of reduce we're not doing
that today but if you're really
interested in micro optimization of this
kind this application is a really great
place to start you want to look in
particular at processing multiple items
per thread instead of just one you'll
also want to perform the first step of
the reduction right when you read the
items from global memory into shared
memory and you want to take advantage of
the fact that warps are synchronous and
when you're doing the last steps of the
reduction but these are all advanced
techniques we can talk about them on the
forums if you all are interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
