together and look at an example of
something that was really hard to do
before and is now shockingly easy with
dynamic parallelism so if you remember
from one of your earlier lectures
quicksort is what's called a
divide-and-conquer algorithm
it works by partitioning an array of
data into two pieces partitioning based
on what's less than or greater than a
pivot value you then call quicksort on
each sub partition which is why it's a
recursive algorithm these sub partitions
then get re partitioned over and over
again recursively and say you end up at
the end with single values and you're
done two important things to notice at
first that the sub partitions aren't
usually the same size and second that
some branches go deeper than others this
means that the number of elements to be
sorted is different each time
and so the decision on whether I need to
sub sort can only be made after I've
done the partitioning that's what makes
it hard to implement on a GPU because
after each step I need to communicate
back to the host CPU all the information
about what I want to launch next that's
a lot of communication at each level of
the algorithm it gets pretty complicated
to manage but even worse I end up
launching each stage of the sort as a
wave of kernels as these things
partition down further and further the
number of kernels that I have to launch
gets larger and larger and the only way
to manage them is to launch them wave
after wave what that means is that I end
up waiting as long as the longest
operation in a wave even if my shorter
ones have already finished before I can
move on to the next stage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
