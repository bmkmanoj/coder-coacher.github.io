our original equation with c plus 4 we
end up with a simplified equation that
is what I just read off I'd like to show
you how the graphs of the old equation
in the new equation compare the first
equation we had is shown by this blue
curve and the new equation is shown by
this orange yellow one now the
difference between these two graphs is
really that the orange one is shifted
four units to the left of the blue one
and we can see that shift written in the
equation in the first version of the new
equation that we had where we have these
c plus 4 is visible however this form is
really not very pretty which is why we
wanted to simplify it although the
simplified version looks better we can't
see this shift the situation for
horizontal shifts then seems kind of
different from the vertical shift
situation we saw earlier that if you
wanted to lower a graph we just needed
to change this constant term in order to
change all the vertical values I think
we're going to need a new form for the
equation of a parabola in order to show
changes in the horizontal direction a
little bit more clearly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
