class question I've seen a lot on the
forums is how do I organize code you
don't want to keep all your stuff in one
Python file what's the correct way to
organize things the first thing I have
to say is there's no correct answer code
organization whether you're writing web
apps or any other type of software is
something that kind of comes from
experience and you kind of develop your
own style when I'm building a web app
generally things start off in one file
and in this file we probably have a
section for handlers these are the
classes that define what we do when a
particular URL is hit almost every
framework i've worked in has this notion
of the handler i mean also has this
notion of a URL mapping this maps a URL
to a particular handler you know we've
dealt with this a lot in this lecture
there's also some DB stuff some objects
the models the things we're actually
working on you know a blog posts you
know pieces of art from a ski chain
links and comments and that sort of
thing and then almost immediately I have
separate files for static content things
like CSS JavaScript we haven't done any
JavaScript in this class really images I
store separately you could you know
encode them into your file but that
doesn't make sense right you just sort
them separately generally you serve them
separately as well App Engine makes it
easy to do that another thing that is
almost always separate from the
beginning are templates I almost always
have templates from the beginning I
didn't teach them from the beginning in
this class because I didn't want to have
to explain HTML and in new Python and
also this kind of new kind of mini
language of templates all at the same
time so I've never actually taught
templates directly in this class
although most of you seem to be using
them at this point you found the
documentation people have talked about
them in forums so these are always
suffer as things grow this file here is
probably my main file it's actually
often called main that pie at least for
me the first thing I do is I pull out
the DB models and I generally have one
file if it's required we don't need this
an app engine refer to it as the ORM I
almost always write my own ORM I don't
really like the home-brewed once or M
stands for object relational mapping
this is a piece of code that basically
maps your Python objects to the
relational database and so it often you
know have a little query language that
compiles into sequel that sort of thing
we haven't had to deal with any of that
in this class because the App Engine
provides it to us the DB model thing
we've been using to interact with the
Google Data store that's basically an
ORM the data model underlying it isn't
strictly relational it's effectively
what it's doing it's taking your Python
objects and abstracting away the the
querying and cursor ring and all of that
stuff you have to do to get stuff in and
out of the database and I generally have
a separate file for each type
of that so in our case you know we've
been talking about posts and art as I
systems grow and you have more data
types you know end-users
I generally pull those apart into
different files and have a bunch of
class specific functions in each of
these you know password hashing and all
that stuff would go in a user's file and
you know functions to get the top posts
and top arts would go in those separate
files so I kind of pull all of that out
next thing I almost always have is some
sort of utils usually have a utils file
or utils module you know a series of
files in a directory that basically have
all the random stuff things like make
secure Val and make salt and random
string you know handy things generally I
want to put as much into utils as I can
just a list of flat functions that have
no dependencies on any other part of the
project the reason I do this is so that
I can test these things these are often
little helpful files that any piece of
the project can manage you know I have a
lot of date manipulation stuff in these
files a lot of string manipulation
escaping stuff all those sort of
functions that I write I usually put in
a file you know it usually starts out
called utils that PI it's really
important that it's always a one way
inherit handlers can import from utils
database can import from utils anything
can important from utils butt utils
never brings in other parts of the
project and that keeps that just kind of
keeps things simple and if you think
about it that way you'll have this nice
clean file a bunch of Handy functions
and if you look at reddit source code
there's maybe about 100 handy little
functions that we use all over the code
and I usually throw that in one spot and
then the final thing I do and this
usually takes more time as a project ROS
is I take handlers out of main dot pi
I might have separate files for each
type of handler for the homeworks I may
have a separate file for just the blog
separate file for ASCII Chan separate
file for those unit two one's the rot13
stuff and then main dot pi is basically
the URL mapping and then a bunch of
imports and then these guys would import
you know whatever database pieces they
need kind of keeps things separate and
sometimes it's really hard to enforce
this and you can have what's called a
circular import where one file rot13 may
depend on some generic files that are
defined in main that PI which depends on
the actual handlers and rot13 itself and
you get this kind of circular import and
generally when you start having circular
imports that means it's time to pull
some common piece of functionality out
so the inheritance only goes one way for
example I have that generic handler I
think I've been calling a blog Handler
and my homework solutions that just kind
of has all that helpful stuff on it that
would get pulled out into its own file
so that main that PI could import it if
it needs it at all the big kind of
groups
handless can import from there as well
you know that's basically how organize
things I'm gonna draw a slightly
different picture of how the file system
might look we'll leave it at that
now again this may not apply to you but
this is what's worked for me so I
usually have my top level I have main
dot PI I probably have some sort of a
common file it's called like handlers
dot PI or something of that nature that
basically has the kind of generic
handler things that happen on every
single request and then I'll probably
have a directory called Lib that might
have some of the DB stuff which may
evolve my models
it may have utils dot PI and any of the
kind of specific stuff that we're doing
got that generic handlers dot PI it
might have the other handlers the blog
dot pi the rot13 dot PI that sort of
thing and the bulk of the code is either
in handlers that PI or in each of these
specific things these are the pieces
that import from all the other parts of
my projects and that's generally kind of
how I start thanks girl from there and
of course you'll have directories for
templates and Static and I'll keep
things organized that way and if we need
sub directories in either of these I may
add them but actually generally for me
my template structure is just a monster
pile of templates and of course as you
get more advanced with templates these
can start inheriting from each other and
I almost always have something like a
base that HTML and then most of my main
templates will inherit from this there
you go I hope that helps many of you
have been asking so let's move on to the
next piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
