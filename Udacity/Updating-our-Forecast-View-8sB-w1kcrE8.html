forecast view a quick glance at the key
lines gives me a sense of deja vu we've
certainly seen these metrics before
furthermore the entire today view is
nearly identical and layout to the top
half of the detailed view except that it
doesn't have the space views at center
our detail view the extra vertical space
in the app bar is the same height as our
list items because we're somewhat
space-constrained we're using a minimal
8dp of spacing for the area between the
high and low temperatures in the daily
forecast and of course we see that the
today view casts a shadow the shadow
helps create the illusion that the
screen is made up of a physical material
but how do we cast the shadow to make
this easier for developers Android L
adds a new parameter into our layout
language elevation paraphrasing from our
material guide elevation is the aspect
of the material design language that
helps users understand the relative
importance of each element and focus
that our attention to the task at hand
it combines the familiar in physical
materials with magical properties that
designers can leverage to create
delightful moments the elevation of a
view represented by the Z property
determines the visual appearance of its
shadow views with higher Z values cast
larger softer shadows views with higher
C values also occlude views with lower c
values however the z value of view does
not affect the views size elevation is
used for the static state of a view
translation z is used to create
animations such as this one where
widgets temporarily rise above the new
plane when performing some action note
that this video represents materials
ideals rather than the reality of the
Android implementation elevation
animations are typically used to help
signify action in response to user touch
setting the elevation parameter on a
view group will cause it to cast a
shadow on other views you have to be a
bit careful as it also changes the way
views clip higher elevation views will
include other views even if they appear
first in the layout the app bar
elevation dimension is for DP we can add
this to our dimensions
just include the Android design library
which defines this dimension to make the
changes to our portrait forecast view we
need to make changes in three places
first we'll update the toolbar section
to create the app bar from the design in
activity main.xml will make changes to
the today view in the list item forecast
today layout and we'll modify the rest
of the forecast list items in the list
item forecast layout before you start
coding you'll grab another code update
which includes correctly sized images
updated list selectors and some useful
dimensions because we have network
loadable image sets you want to
constrain the width of our icon images
in the forecast list 240 dps in the list
icon dimension we give to you you can
use the touch selector white to replace
the today touch selector the large
numbers are 32 DP while the text view is
49 DP wide I'm intentionally using DP
instead of SP here because I don't want
these numbers to change size when the
system font is set to large size I'm
intentionally using DP instead of SP
here because I don't want these numbers
to change size from the system font is
set to large size we're pretty tight on
space on narrow devices already the app
bar is pretty simple we take advantage
of the fact that the toolbar will Center
its children with respect to the entire
layout if we use layout gravity equals
Center horizontal therefore we include
the image you inside of the toolbar with
a height of list preferred item height
and a margin top of action bar size
while having wrap content for width to
let the toolbar Center it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
