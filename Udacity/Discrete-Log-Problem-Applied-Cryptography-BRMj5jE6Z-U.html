related to the diffie-hellman security
property is the discrete log problem
discrete logs are like continuous logs
but over a discrete group
so continuous log if we have eight of X
equals B and we know a and B we can
solve for X that's the log base a of B
and they're well known efficient ways to
compute these logarithms one of the
earliest use of computers was to compute
these tables of logarithms with discrete
numbers this gets much more interesting
so now we have eight of X it will be
modulo some value N and our goal is to
solve for x which is the discrete log
base a of B and this turns out to be as
far as everyone can tell a very hard
problem when n is a large prime number
it's not clear that this great log
always exists and for certain choices of
a B and n it would not exist but if we
choose n as a large prime number and a
as a generator well then by definition
it must exists what it means for a
number to be a generator is that if we
raise G to each power what we get is a
permutation of the numbers in the group
CN so as the little demonstration
certainly not a proof here's a code that
produces the permutation for given some
generator and some modulus raises the
generator to every power between 1 and
the modulus minus 1 so we can try that
with a fairly small prime number so you
can see the results will use 277 as our
prime number and 5 is a generator for
277 one could check that in a
brute-force way just show that it all
produces all the numbers and we'll see
that in the output for generator
permutation these are the results and
you can see the first one is 5 that's 5
to the 125 is 5 to the 2 125 is 5 to the
3 the next one is 71 because 5 to the 4
mod 277 is 71 and if we look at all the
numbers here it would be a permutation
on the numbers from 1 to 276 other than
the early ones it would be fairly hard
to predict where a number is in this
sequence you could certainly compute the
whole sequence to find it the question
the discrete log is asking is given a
number can you figure out where
would be in this sequence or can you
figure out the power that you need to
raise the generator to to find it and
the claim is that that's hard to do
showing the sequence certainly is not
enough to convince you that that's hard
to do and there's no proof that it's
hard the reason people believe it's hard
is that many smart people have tried to
find good ways of doing this and none of
the solutions run in polynomial time
that the fastest known solutions are
exponential that means essentially that
the only way to solve this is to try all
possible powers until you find the one
that works you can do a little better
than that by trying powers in a clever
way and you can exclude some of the
powers more quickly but you can't do any
better than doing this exponential
search which is exponential in the size
of n so this is something we have to be
careful about when we talk about hard
problems when we say it's exponential
well it's not exponential in the value
of n it's linear in the value of n we
just need to try n operations but the
magnitude of n grows as 2 to the number
of bits needed to write down in so as
long as that's the best solution to
discrete log then for very large n it's
intractable no matter how many computing
resources you have you can't do this
exponential search you can't find the
value of x that's the street log of B
they say mod n so as long as no one can
find a fast way to the skull solve the
discrete log problem as long as n is
large and is an arbitrary instance of
this problem we think that it should be
hard to compute X given a and B and the
modulus so for this quiz we'll assume
that we have an adversary that's passive
so all they can do is eavesdrop on the
messages but they also have access to a
powerful computing resource they have a
procedure D log that is a fast procedure
for computing discrete logs that works
on any inputs and they have modular
exponentiation a fast procedure that
outputs base to the power mod modulus
and now the question is can they break a
diffie-hellman key so we're assuming
that they're a passive attacker so
they've eavesdropped on all the messages
between Alice and Bob so they have all
these values that were sent over the
security and the possible answers are no
that it's impossible with no more
resources
more information or that yes there is a
way to do it and here's the way that she
would compute that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
