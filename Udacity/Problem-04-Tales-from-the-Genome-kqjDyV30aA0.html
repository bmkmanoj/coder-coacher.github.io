obtained by comparing sequences from at
least three or more individuals now
although some may dispute this with me
and I think it could be up for
interpretation the answer to this is
true and the reason is because if I am
comparing let's say sequences from two
people let's just take the first
position in the sequence the a of the
ATT a if I compared to people and
they're different at the first position
let's say they're one person isn't a one
person has a tea I can't arrive at a
consensus from this because it's equal
agreement right but if I have a third
sequence now I know that the thymine is
the consensus so in this case three or
more individuals allows me to come up
with a consensus now the two reasons
that this might be disputed or the two
caveats to this is well what if I had
four sequences right and I had to with
the a and two at the tea it's so split
even so I can't exactly come up with a
consensus but in this case we're
thinking about what's theoretically
possible right there's no way you could
do with one sequence there's no way you
could do it with two sequences but it's
possible at three or more you could
arrive at a consensus another
possibility instead of actually having a
fourth sequence here's what if the third
sequence had a see here instead and
while that is possible in general these
kinds of differences that we're going to
be looking at are always or are
typically going to be just two possible
allelic differences for most positions
in the genome it's usually not a choice
between four letters it's a choice
between just two letters that's not
always true vast majority of the time
that's going to be the case where you
just have one letter or another and
that's just based on the probability of
the mutation rate and how these things
spread but I accept that those are
caveats so if you put false for this I
can see how you were thinking through
that as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
