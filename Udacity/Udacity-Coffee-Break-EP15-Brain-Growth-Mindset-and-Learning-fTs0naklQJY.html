I'm Brenna and I work with Udacity
student community with me today is
Professor Joel bowler who teaches at
Stanford and teaches mathematics
education Joe can you talk to me about
the brain and learning sure hi everyone
so there's some really important new
evidence coming out on the brain and
learning that all learners should know
about them there's a recent evidence
that's been shocking the scientist
that's basically showing that the brain
is so incredibly plastic and changeable
in ways that they never thought before
so now people are finding that every
time somebody learns something that
changes the structure of their brain
brains of that changeable and that one
of the best research studies that showed
this was a study that showed during a
three-week intervention where people
were working on math problems and other
problems the structure of their brains
changed that's how fast they can change
so we used to think that there were math
people and no math people smart people
and no less smart now we know those
labels just don't work because anybody
can succeed at the highest levels in
math or any subject if they if they are
learning and if they have the right sort
of materials to learn so we really need
to get rid of those myths about some
people being smart and some people not
because recent evidence is knocking all
of that down hmm
how does this relate to mindset so Carol
Dweck is a researcher at Stanford she
has decades of very solid research on
mindset which shows that people
basically fall into one of two
categories they're either fixed mindset
or growth mindset and we were the fixed
mindset believed that
smartness is really more or less fixed
you can't really change your basic
intelligence and those people have a set
of behaviors that turns out to be very
damaging for them whereas growth mindset
people believe that the more what you do
the smarter you get and it turns out
those two beliefs predict the way people
behave and their achievement so fixed
mindset people if they fail on something
often feel really bad because that
doesn't they're not smart they're not a
math person growth mindset people if
they fail and
think think you know this is a challenge
and they want to go further so it's very
important to have a growth mindset
people who achieve highly and work in
life those are the growth mindset and we
can people can change from a fix to a
growth mindset but I think the other
super important thing that we've learned
is that it turns out mistakes are the
most important things for learning and
that when you make a mistake your brain
grows and your brain grows in those
moments more than it does in other times
so in math for example the thing we want
people to be doing is making mistakes
when you make a mistake things happen in
your brain that don't happen as other
times it's super important to be making
mistakes and they're very helpful for
learning and I think that's a really
important thing to know how do you think
mindset applies to online learner
learning so yeah when you're taking a
course online I think the biggest thing
to know about and understand is that you
can achieve in this course and the
Udacity courses have everything in them
for people to achieve so having that
understanding that you can achieve in
that if you struggle on these problems
you're going to grow your brain and
really do well it's super important to
know and if you make a mistake that
thing's wrong instead of thinking oh
I've hit a wall this is as far as I can
go to think this is great this is where
my brain is really growing and I'm going
to go on from this so really important I
think for people in online courses if
our viewers want to learn more about
mindset and where can they go yes if
there's a great website the brain ology
website which has all lots of mindset
information and interventions antique
teaching an online course right now at
Stanford which it's free and it's about
how to learn and also has work on
mindset to help people shift from a fix
to avoid mindset wonderful um thank you
so much for coming happy Friday we have
a coffee break ride a cheese</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
