question we had 12 modulo 3 and 12 is
equal to 3 times 4 so that means if we
divide 12 by 3 we get 4 with no
remainder so that means the result of 12
modulo 3 is 0 for the second question we
could solve this by figuring out what or
tavae is but we don't actually need to
we know that the value of org for a is
always going to be the same every time
we do it so this is saying the same
value modulo the same value the result
is always going to be 0 because anything
is divisible by itself with no remainder
so that the answer is also 0 for Part C
well now we've added 3 in order to know
what the result is here we've got to
know whether or does e is greater than
or less than 3 as long as order of Z is
greater than 3 well that would mean Ord
of Z plus 3 modulo Ord of Z must be 3
because the remainder will be what we
added to Ord of Z since Ord of Z by
itself is always divisible by Ord of Z
and we do know that order of Z is
greater than 3 so that means the result
will be 3 so let's try that last one in
the Python interpreter we're going to
print the value of Ord of Z plus 3
modulo Ord of Z and when we run that we
see the result is 3 and I want to point
out that the parentheses here are
actually important if we didn't have
them if we tried the order of Z plus 3
or at of Z then we get the result 125
and the reason for that is the grouping
here is going to group 3 mod or Z and
add that toward Z so it's a different
value and the reason we get 125 is the
value of or Z by itself is 122
so it's 122 which is Ord of Z plus 3 mod
Ord of Z which is 3 mod 122 which is 3
which is why we got 125 when we
evaluated this without the parentheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
