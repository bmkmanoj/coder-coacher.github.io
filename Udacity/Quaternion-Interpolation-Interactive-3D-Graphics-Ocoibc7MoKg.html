an object how its rotated they can do
the same thing as access angle rotations
they rotate a model around a given axis
by an angle they get a lot of use in
animation because you can easily
interpolate between one orientation and
another think of two vectors poking
through a sphere at the origin if you
want to change your orientation and go
from one vector to the other there are a
number of ways you can do it say you
want to do this over four frames you
can't normally do this well with Euler
angles the change in direction is likely
to need more than one Euler angle
changed at a time changing two Euler
angles at once can give you problems
with gimbal lock as one angle is applied
before the other Euler angles are
terrible for interpolation around an
arbitrary axis especially when the
change is large using an axis angle
scheme you would go a quarter of the
angle and form the matrix every frame
would need to form a new matrix which
can get pricey creating each takes a
number of trigonometric function calls
quaternions are a third solution you can
set quaternions to perform the same
interpolation in a clean way and in a
form is compact as access angle just
four values no trigonometry calls are
needed quaternions themselves are fairly
non-intuitive as to what their four
numbers mean in physical terms when
compared to access angle however just
like you rarely look at a single number
in Sailor rotation matrix meaning of the
quaternions individual values doesn't
really matter when you're using them
when you interpolate around an axis it's
called a slurp short for spherical
linear interpolation all this means is
that you're moving from one point on the
sphere to another in a direct and linear
fashion 3j s and many other packages
support quaternions because of the
simplicity in three.js if you wanted to
use angle axis rotations you'd also have
to maintain your own translation and
scale matrices for the object being
rotated because quaternions are fully
supported as a separate interpolation
system you can enable these in 3GS while
still using the position and scale
parameters quaternions make it easy to
specify and interpolate between various
orientations similar to rotation
matrices but with less values involved
you can also multiply quaternions
together doing so produces a new
quaternion that is a result of this
series of rotations quaternions are
often used for animation paths or flying
controls in fact 3GS uses them for just
that class flight controls Jas that's
you do have to be careful in using
quaternions with cameras in that the up
Vector will not be maintained throughout
the slurp and you'll need to reorient
try the demo that follows it moves the
birds hat back and forth on his head in
a jaunty way you can choose to
interpolate using Euler angles or
quaternions with all your angles on try
setting the angles to their maximum if
you look from above you'll see that the
path is not straight around the head but
rather takes an s-shaped curve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
