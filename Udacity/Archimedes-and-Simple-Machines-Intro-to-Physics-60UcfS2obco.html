obsessed with a simple question how can
I lift a hundred kilogram mass to a
height of 1 meter okay so this might not
have been exactly how we phrased the
question but this captures the essence
of what Archimedes was thinking when he
invented many of the simple machines
naively we might think the only way to
answer this question of how to get this
let's say 100 kilogram rock onto this
one meter table is well to pick it up
and put it on the table
Archimedes however realized there's
better ways to solve this problem one
way is to use an inclined plane and we
analyze the inclined plane a little bit
in the previous problem set when we use
an inclined plane we reduce the force we
have to push with though at an expense
we have to push over a longer distance
before we had to lift one meter but now
we have to push a distance that's
greater than 1 meter another option is
to use a system of pulleys police
actually have the same trade-off that
inclined planes do we may not have to
pull quite as hard but we'll have to
pull over a greater distance once again
we see this force and distance trade-off
popping up another simple machine that
could help us out is the lever if we use
a lever we can exert a smaller force
than we would have to who were just
picking it up but once again we'll have
to exert it over a greater distance just
to lift this rock 1 meter this is very
interesting let's dig deeper into some
of these simple machines and see if we
can quantify what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
