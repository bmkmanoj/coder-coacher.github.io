hormone produced by the body and it is
important to give us fuel during
emotional arousal and stressful events
however course all is also part of the
immune system functioning and it
decreases the number of immune cells
available in the bloodstream to fight
off infection therefore when we stressed
we're more likely to get sick as an
example when I was getting ready to
write this lesson I became very sick I
got a terrible cold I was really
stressed I had to write this lesson I
was behind in my grading I had theses to
review and on top of it my poor cat
nonsense was sick it's no doubt than or
surprising why students get sick around
midterm and finals the important thing
to remember here is that when we
experience a stressful event cortisol is
released which decreases our immune
system functioning now we're going to go
to Greg and look at how we handle stress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
