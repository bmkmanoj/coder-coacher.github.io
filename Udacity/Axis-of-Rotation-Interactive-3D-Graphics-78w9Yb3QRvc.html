that much for us I've shown you how to
do exactly what you already knew how to
do translate and rotate around the XY or
z axis here's a transform that isn't
built into the object 3d class access
angle rotation and for that you really
do need to use a separate matrix say I
want to make a little star-shaped
ornament out of four cylinders or if
you're feeling more dramatic I want to
make some carbon fiber caltrops to trip
up the Robo minotaurs about to launch a
final assault on our base enceinte ez
prime it's really our only last hope huh
I'm better now
well anyway I want to align the four
cylinders with the four diagonals of a
cube the hard part is figuring out the
rotation matrix I want to use if I'm
stuck using Euler angles do I rotate in
Y and then an X or Z and then in Y or
something else with the axis angle
function I need to figure out what axis
I want to rotate around and how much to
rotate we're going to use cylinders to
make our object here's a cutaway view of
the cube showing the original position
of the cylinder and its desired location
of the wireframe along one of the
diagonals every cylinder starts pointing
up along the y axis step one is to
figure out around which axis to rotate
this vertical cylinder I want to rotate
the cylinder to the point XYZ all equal
to one the question to you is which axis
do I want to rotate around in order to
get this cylinder into its final
position
your choices are axis one which is along
the y axis X is two which goes along
negative x and Z X is three which goes
along this XYZ axis itself and your last
choice is axis for which goes along the
z axis mark each that is correct if any
if you get stuck you might want to go
back to the answer for how we formed a
disc shaped object out of the swept
clock hands as that might help you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
