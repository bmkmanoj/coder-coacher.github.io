Rosenberg just described it
was Charles Darwin who first conducted
research on emotion expression he argued
that emotions were expressed similarly
in humans and an even non-human animals
sometimes and this is the idea of
universality emotions are universally
expressed in similar ways all over the
world so a smile for instance is a smile
regardless of who expresses it but
Darwin's work was not systematic so in
the 1960s Paul Ekman and his colleague
Wallace freezin took up Darwin's work
and became more systematic and more
scientific they conducted research on
universality in Western cultures and
found universality that is people
expressed emotions very much the same
way and interpreted them very much the
same way but this was just in the West
it wasn't a true test of universality so
in the late 1960s Paul Ekman and an
anthropologist went to Papua New Guinea
to conduct research and they went to
Papua New Guinea because it was a pre
literate culture that had no contact
whatsoever at the time to the west and
he found evidence for universality have
anger disgust fear happiness sadness and
surprise and later on he and his
colleagues found universal evidence for
contempt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
