concept of validation validation
basically means verifying on the server
side that what we received is what we
expected to receive so we have you and
we have our servers and you're
submitting to our forum certain values
let's say you're sending you know the Q
parameter it's a checkbox that we put on
our forum and it's value equals on and
the server receives that and knows what
to do if Q equals on and it knows what
to do if Q is not present you know that
means the checkbox wasn't checked but
what if there's a what if there's a bad
guy and he's wearing a hat and he
submits to our server the cute parameter
but instead of equaling on or not being
present he submits the word broken now
depending on how our server is
programmed you know it can just it can
say oh I don't know what you know broken
means so I'm just gonna assume it's
unchecked which is probably the smart
thing to do and that's you know that
that's great the point I'm trying to
make however is that just because we
have a form with a checkbox on it that
you know limits what a user can send us
through the form it doesn't mean that
somebody can't you know send directly to
our server parameters with you know
arbitrary junk in them and it's up to
our server to make sure that we handle
it safely
always remember that your server can
receive junk and it needs to be smart
enough to deal with somebody sending
completely broken data you know and it
doesn't necessarily have to be the
string broken right this could be you
know a megabyte of trash and you don't
want to just blindly you know do
something with it so make sure you're
always validating your parameters and
that's what we're going to talk about
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
