have a storyboard and our storyboard has
been updated with the table vc a
tableview controller also we have a
notes view controller class that
inherits from core data table view
controller and has a pretty standard
self a row index path we get the note we
get the cell and we sink note and sell
and we returned to sell the interesting
part really is in the prepare for say on
notebooks vc let's take a look at it
the first thing we need is a fetch
request for the notes next we need to
specify how would like them to be sorted
so we're going to do that by creation
date and also by the text the next step
would be to create the NS fetch results
controller and we injected into the
notes view controller and we can display
let's take a look at how this displays
so we have the notebooks and i'll select
these notes the ones in coding notes and
we get them all
instead of two we get three
so what is missing here what's missing
is a way to filter only those notes that
we are interested in in this case those
that belong to the specific notebook and
the way to filter the search results is
by adding an instance of NS predicate to
fetch request and it's predicated is a
class that filters the search results it
can be configured with a special micro
language called predicated query
language
don't worry about that it's extremely
simple so let's add one to fetch request
the easiest way to create an S predicate
is with a format string so in order to
create the predicate first of all we
need to find what's the exact notebook
that were selecting at this point
you will need that information in order
to filter so first thing we get the
index path for the selected row and then
with object at index path we obtain the
notebook always remember to cast it to
notebook
once we have this can go ahead and
create the predicate the easiest way is
using this initializer is predicated and
then a format which is simply a string
kind of a template string and an array
of arguments of objects that will be
substituted or inserted into the the
template the template simply States
notebook that means the property
notebook of the note must be equal to
$OPERAND and this is a marker that says
that we're going to substitute here an
object what object the notebook so it's
that easy
we're just saying the notebook must be
equal to this one and your then added to
the fetch request and if you run you
have two notes and once we click here we
only get to so yeah it's that simple
check it out for yourself and i also
recommend you take a look at the NS
predicate documentation as it can create
very complex filters with it
we barely scratched the surface and it's
an extremely powerful class definitely a
tool worth having under your belt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
