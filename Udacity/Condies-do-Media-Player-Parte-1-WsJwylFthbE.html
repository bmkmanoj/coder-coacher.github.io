the states of a media player but you're
gonna be playing the part of the media
player so sit down for a moment and wait
for my first instruction now think of a
song in your head and prepare to sing it
all right now start singing it aloud and
pause and I like you to resume where he
left off and now stop and completely
forget that song now I want you to think
of an entirely different song
but don't sing aloud just yet alright
and start singing it now and stop great
job
take a moment sit back and relax so why
did I make you sing well to help to
explain this concept so playing the
audio files within the media player
class is managed via state machine and
this means that there are different
states that we can transition between as
the media player plays a song so we can
draw a diagram known as a state machine
diagram to help visualize the different
states that media player can be in so
first off is the idle state which means
that the media player object is just
sitting there idly not making any sound
and this is just like how you were idle
sitting there waiting for my
instructions following that is the
prepared state meaning that the media
player is preparing to play certain
audio file like a song and this is just
like how you're thinking about a song
and preparing to sing it but didn't make
any sound just yet and then comes the
started state meaning that the media
player is playing a certain audio file
like our song so this is similar to when
you started seeing the song aloud your
boat gently down the stream and then
comes a pause state when you want to
pause the song and this is like when you
pause your singing now for the PAS state
you can move back to the started state
if you want to resume the song where you
left off now at any time you can stop
singing the song meaning that the media
player is in its stop state now there's
one catch once you stop the media player
you can't resume it again you need to
set it up to prepare to sing it again by
specifying which song you want to play
so either the same or a different song
and that's why I had you think of a
different song in preparing it and then
I had
seeing leader song moving us back to
started state again as you can see there
are a number of different states to the
media player used to control how audio
is played back to the user and again
this is referred to as a state machine
diagram we actually presented a
simplified version of the media player
lifecycle in order to help you
understand the big picture first now the
official documentation page contains a
complete state machine diagram which you
should refer to in the future so at
first I know it can all look very
overwhelming but notice that the diagram
has the states that we talked about so
idle prepared started paused stopped and
a couple other ones note that it also
provides details on what media player
methods we can call in order to
transition between these states so feel
free to take a look at the state diagram
or on your own and we've linked it below
in the notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
