given to intercept a ciphertext C 1 and
C 2 you can see those both below and you
know that they were both encrypted using
a one-time pad using the same key
they're also both messages in standard
English your goal is to figure out what
the two plaintext messages were you can
enter these in any order and it should
be clear to you that which one is which
can't really be determined but figure
out what the - plaintext messages
corresponding to the two intercepted
cipher texts are and I should mention
that you can assume that both messages
are in English and were encoded using
string two bits that map's English to
sequences of bits I'm not going to
provide an answer to this one but I'll
give you a hint how to get started if
you were stuck and that would be to try
common English sequences of letters th e
would be a good one to try and assume
that probably appears somewhere and at
least one of the quotes and you can try
th e at each of the starting positions
and then assume that's in say message 1
so you're gonna guess ciphertext 1 is th
e encrypted with a key then you can
compute the key from this that gives you
what the likely key is X soaring string
2 bits of th e with the corresponding
part of that ciphertext and then you
connect or X soaring out to guest key
from the corresponding part of message 2
if that looks like something that might
be part of an English message well then
that's a good guess and you can work on
from there and start expanding the
letters that you've guessed to see ones
that produce reasonable results for bill
cipher texts this is a fairly manual
process if you wanted to do this more
automated way well then you'd use
properties of English to automate this
kind of guessing and expansion for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
