pro these complex fractions if you got
this one correct the lowest common
denominator might have been tricky so
let's find that first we look at the
denominators of 3a squared B and a B we
know these two denominators share a
common factor of a times B the other
factor for this denominator is 3 a and
the other factor for this denominator is
1 we multiply them together to get 3
times a squared times B and remember we
want the highest power of any variable
or factor that appears on our
denominators 3 is the highest number
factor a squared is the highest variable
factor for a and 1 b or just be is the
highest factor for well be next we
multiply by the LCD / the LCD a form of
one these two factors would cancel out
leaving us with 2x Y in the numerator
here we can cancel out 1a and 1b this
means we have to drop this power down by
1 leaving us with 38 times this
expression 3 times 6 is 18 and then we
just list the product of the variables
now you might be wondering why I listed
this a first instead of on the end
usually we list the product of the
variables in alphabetical order but it's
certainly okay to leave this a on the
end and finally we want to simplify our
rational expression these are the
factors of the numerator and these are
the factors of the denominator we can
cancel the factors that equal 1 which
leaves us with a 1 in the numerator and
nine times a times X times y in our
denominator this is why it's important
to remember that 2/2 equals 1 there's
still a 1 in our numerator you want to
make sure that appears in our answer we
can't simplify this anymore since one is
the only factor in our numerator so
we're completely done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
