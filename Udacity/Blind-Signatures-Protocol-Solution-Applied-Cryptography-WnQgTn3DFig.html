values would be sufficient those are the
values that the bank would need to
unbind the messages because the bank can
decrypt all the messages using its
private key and then divide out the K
raised to the e.b power from the results
it would be okay to send this but
there's no need there's no security loss
in sending the RI values except for the
14 messages X but the bank is going to
learn those anyway since after it
divides out the ki to the eb power it
has all of these values so at the end of
this protocol Ellis will be able to
compute message X signed by the bank so
now Alex can spend the bill give it to
Kathy Kathy can verify the signature and
she could deposit the bill in the bank
the bank checks that this ID has not
been spent before and believes that at
the valid bill if alice spends the bill
again when doug gives it to the bank the
bank vet checks the signature but finds
that this RI value was previously used
so the bank knows the bill was double
spend the problem is the bank doesn't
know who double spent the bill the bank
received the bills from Kathy and Doug
but they weren't the double spenders
they were the ones that were duped into
accepting the bill Ellis was the double
spender and because of this blind
signature scheme the bank doesn't know
that alice is the one who spent the bill
so for this approach to work we need a
way to trace the double spent bill back
to the person you double spent it but we
also want the bills to be anonymous so
that sounds like a contradictory
property there's actually a way to
achieve this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
