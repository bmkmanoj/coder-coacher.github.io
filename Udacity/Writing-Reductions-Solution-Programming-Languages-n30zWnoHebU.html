hopefully what we're currently looking
at is X goes to a B dot nothing coming
from J hopefully then if we look back to
chart J where we originally came from it
will have some rule something goes to
blah blah blah dot X this is the
important part we're reducing X goes to
a B so I really hope somebody was
looking for an X if they were then that
can be one of our reductions once again
we're going to use the phenomenal cosmic
power of Python list comprehensions and
in general we're going to take all of
these states that were already in chart
J and just modify them a bit so let's
call each one of those states in chart j
j state know conceptually what we're
going to do is move the red dot over one
so our return value the new state we're
returning it's going to have this same y
that we saw from j state so whatever
that is that's still going to be our
left hand side then we want to take
whatever j state had before the dot and
that corresponds to all of this stuff
that i've sort of left out here but then
add on X because we're shifting over X
conceptually as we do the reduction and
now we want to take everything Jay state
had after the dot except we want to
remove the X because we shifted the red
dot over it so everything Jay state had
after the dot was J state bracket 2 and
we're going to do range selection on
that to get rid of the first element and
then it looks like I can't pre-plan
whatever this k value was we're just
going to leave it alone MJ state 3
corresponds to k however we only want to
do this if certain conditions hold first
CD has to be the empty list which
corresponds to this red dot being as far
to the right as possible the second
thing we have to check for is that this
X and that one match exactly this X was
the first element of j state 0 1 2 so
I'll check to make sure that J state 2
is not empty if this red dot were all
the way to the right there'd be nothing
there to check for and if it's not empty
I'm going to check its first character
and make sure that matches up with RX
and those are
all of the states we bring in as part of
doing reductions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
