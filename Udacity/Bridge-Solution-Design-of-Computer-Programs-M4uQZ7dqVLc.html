the search problem rather than try to
make you do it yourself because it's
still a few tricks here that are
different from the previous search
problem so i'm going to define bridge
problem which takes a sequence of
elements here and if you want you can
pass in a frozen set of 12 5 10 or
whatever but if you didn't I'm going to
go ahead and do that conversion for you
I'm going to make it into a frozen set
and I'm going to add in the light in
case you forgot to specify that so you
can just ask bridge problem of the list
1 2 5 10 I'll take care of it all for
you like before the explored set starts
off being the empty set the frontier
starts off being the one initial state
which is the frozen set we've just made
up for the everything that's on the here
side an empty set for everything that's
on the day our side and 0 for the
elapsed time the idea is to get
everybody away from here on to the other
side and so if we were given a trivial
problem where there was already nobody
here then we're done and we return that
initial state otherwise just like before
we start popping things off the frontier
just like before we're looking at our
successors and the only difference is
down here whereas before we we put a
path on the end and we were expanding
out our frontier and taking off the
shortest path first from our frontier
because in the previous problem in the
water pouring problem the best solution
was defined as a solution that was
shortest with the smallest number of
steps in this problem the best solution
is defined as the one with the smallest
elapsed time where the elapsed time of a
path is the second element that's the
key element here of the final element of
the path that's that would be the total
elapsed time of a path and so we saw at
the frontier by the total elapsed time
now it is a little bit wasteful here
that we're going through this loop we
only added in one new element and we
sorted the whole thing Python is
actually pretty good at that type of
sort there are other ways to make that
more efficient but just conceptually
that's what we're doing we always want
to have the
frontier sorted so that we're taking the
fastest time first so I typed that
program in and I ran it for the very
first time rich problem 1 2 5 10 I got
an answer back and remember the answer
is a path which is an alternation of
states and actions we can pick out just
the actions like this by asking for the
path and then taking a slice of that
path starting at element number one
going to the end and giving us every
other element so that'll be just the
actions and those are these three
actions that's my proposed solution that
my program came up with and my question
is is that correct yes or no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
