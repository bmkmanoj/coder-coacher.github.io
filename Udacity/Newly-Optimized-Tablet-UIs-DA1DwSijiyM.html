how of adaptive design let's look back
at those suburbs more tablet you eyes
and see what we can do to improve them
so this gmail esque example previously
led to uncomfortable reading experiences
on y de screens we can use the divide
pattern to show message details on
larger devices to make better use of the
space and contain eva column from
becoming too wide and uncomfortable to
read here we're capping the list at a
maximum width and then filling the
remaining space with the message details
notice that we're also using the expand
pattern within the message details where
it also caps that body at a maximum
width to ensure a comfortable reading by
introducing margins beyond that point
this adaptation could also help with
context we can read a message within the
larger context of other emails for
example seeing if a new message comes in
if we don't have more content that we
can reveal then we can restrict the
width of the surface and use generous
margins to stop it from becoming
unbalanced before this example felt
unbalanced on larger devices leaving
large areas of white space we can apply
the extend pattern and introduce this
new surface to contain the form on
larger screens we Center this surface
and apply generous margins within it to
maintain balance in our last example we
proved see had a number of issues with
unbalanced layout overly wide buttons
and poor use of imagery when adapting to
wider devices we can set a maximum width
on the buttons and here we reflow them
to the right preventing them from
reaching awkward sizes can also use the
expand pattern on the content to Center
on its own surface beyond a certain
width and lastly we switch to a more
immersive image position with the
content overlapping it to prevent the
issues we saw before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
