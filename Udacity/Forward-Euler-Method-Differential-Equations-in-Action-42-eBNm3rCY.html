rates of change of the position and the
velocity the rate of change of the
position is the velocity and the rate of
change of the velocity is the
acceleration which is Spaniels law force
divided by mass and in a typical setting
we also know the position at time zero
and the velocity at time zero now we are
going to use the computer to learn what
these equations are leading to and the
easiest way for doing so is called the
forward Euler method the most complex
thing with that method may be the name
of Euler Euler was born in Basel
Switzerland that is most people these
days use the German pronunciation of his
name boiler even though the Swiss
pronunciation may be different from that
and in the US you may also hear the
pronunciation Euler I try to stick to
the pronunciation Euler but forgive me
if I from time to time fall back into
saying u lon all's idea was to solve
these equations by walking in small time
steps if we start at the initial
position X of 0 and the initial velocity
V of 0 what would happen after a short
time spin we call H the position would
approximately increase by H times the
velocity if the velocity is 2 meters per
second and we wait for 3 seconds with a
change in the position by 6 meters for
instance but of course we're using a
much smaller time step similarly for the
velocity after some small time H the
velocity will be its original value plus
the time step times the acceleration
which is F over m so these equations
will take us from time 0 to time H
approximately
I'm cheating a little when I write equal
signs here in the same fashion we can
get from time H to time 2h doing another
step this is what the second step looks
like we know the position that we have
reached at the end of the first step and
we continue with the new velocity and
that results in the new position
similarly for the velocity to iterate
this process over and over again and
find estimates for positions
velocities as you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
