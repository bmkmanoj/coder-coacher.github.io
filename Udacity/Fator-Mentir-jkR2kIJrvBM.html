something called the live factor live
factor is a metric that was created by
Edward Tufte that describes the
integrity of a graphic or how will a
graphic actually represents its
underlying data you compute the live
factor by dividing the size of the
effect as shown in the graphic by the
size of the effect shown in the data
typically we want the live factor too
thin 0.95 and 1.05 a live factor of one
is ideal because we would have the exact
same effect shown in the graphic as it
is in the data but due to some jitter
with how we represent data in graphical
form having a live factor within this
range is typically seen as very good a
visualization with a live factor in this
range has high integrity and is
representing the data accurately now
that we know what live factor is how do
we calculate it so let's recall that lie
factor measures the difference between
the effect shown in the graphic and the
effect seen in the data first let's look
at how we would calculate the size of
the effect shown in the graphic first
we'll find the difference by subtracting
the second value from the first value
seen in the graphic then we'll compute
the change by dividing by the first
value will need to add absolute value
bars here to account for negative change
multiplying this by 100 gives us the
change as a percentage we apply this
method to a the graphic and the data and
then divide this entire quantity to get
our overall life actor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
