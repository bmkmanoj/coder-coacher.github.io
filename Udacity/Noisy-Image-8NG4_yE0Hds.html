about segmentation I want to motivate
this using a toy problem very simple
problem and then we'll move to slightly
more sophisticated examples so here's
our toy example problem so here we have
an image on the left and you can see
that there are not that many gray levels
present in fact there's a histogram of
them on the right and on the histogram
you can see that there's this big
collection of black pixels another
collection of gray pixels even a little
bit bigger and what's this thing on the
right that's this huge collection of
white pixels and their exact they're
black gray and white which leads to
thinking that okay in this image there
are three regions and I would label them
one for the black two for the gray and
three for the white so the idea is that
we went from the groups in this
histogram to these segments in the
picture but of course that's on this
trivial picture here we have that clean
image what if you have a noisier image
right so here I've just added a little
bit of noise and now our histogram is
not just these straight lines anymore
but we get these distributions of
intensity so a question of how do we
break things up and the question is you
know how do we carve this histogram into
these different groups in particular we
refer to this as clustering so there's a
fundamental relationship between
segmentation which is carving an image
up and this notion of clustering which
pixels belong together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
