your instructors for college algebra
animals architecture and innovation
you'll be seeing a lot of our hands
throughout the course but we thought we
would show you our faces too so you can
get to know us better for you people out
there who don't think you are math
people we're out here to prove you wrong
recent research has shown that students
who have difficulties learning
mathematics have difficulties not
because they're not smart but because
often they've had bad experiences
learning mathematics what's even better
is that you can help your brain grow
through doing math this course is
designed to help you play around with
college algebra try stuff out make
mistakes try again just get involved
with it research also shows that making
mistakes helps with learning you're here
to learn about college algebra we don't
expect you to know everything and you're
not alone either we have thousands of
students all over the world taking this
course talking about math can actually
help you learn it better and the forum
is a great place to do this you can ask
questions about things you don't
understand or even just about cool
algebra related things this is probably
pretty different from other math classes
you've taken before it's themed based
and it focuses on inquiry learning which
means that we help you discover the
mathematics on your own and show how
it's relevant for your life we hope you
enjoy the course let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
