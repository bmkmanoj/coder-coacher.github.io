choice that we should make really sure
that we understand the problem before we
progress on trying to solve it I'll talk
next about what it means to understand a
problem and how to do that but let me go
through the other answers before it's
often tempting to start writing code too
early writing code is fun and that's
what we like to do as programmers and
computer scientists
the problem with starting to write code
before we understand a problem is we
might write the wrong code we might get
very frustrated trying to write code
before we really understand the problem
or how to solve it or we might end up
writing a lot of code that doesn't
actually solve the problem we wanted to
solve the third choice is actually a
very good answer if this weren't a
practice problem it was a practice
problem you're going to learn a lot more
by trying to solve it yourself than
finding an existing answer and then
maybe understanding the answer you'll
still learn something you learn a lot
more by trying to solve things yourself
if it weren't a practice problem and you
just want to solve this and move on to
the next thing
searching to see if someone has already
solved the problem and for a problem
like this probably there are good
solutions out there already is a better
use of your time then writing your own
solution unless your goal is to learn
something by writing your own solution
the fourth choice to start working on an
algorithm also depends on understanding
the problem until we understand the
problem well we don't know what
algorithm we need to create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
