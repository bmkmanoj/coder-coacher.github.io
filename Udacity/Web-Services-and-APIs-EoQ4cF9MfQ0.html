to request content like what's in a web
page images text video but for the apps
that we'll be riding we'll use HTTP in a
slightly different way instead of using
URLs like udacity.com we'll use special
URLs that correspond to methods like get
image data that are made available by
web services web services sometimes are
also referred to as api's but don't get
confused they mean the same thing I want
to take a look at a quick example from
the Flickr API we're gonna look at
Flickr people get public photos this
method returns some kind of image data
back to our client or an app we're gonna
look at Flickr's documentation for this
method now I posted a link in the
instructor notes so this is the
documentation for get public photos and
there's a something that I want to draw
to your attention first and that is the
use of arguments so the arguments listed
here are a lot like the arguments that
you'd see for a swift function call and
you'll also notice that some of them are
required like API key while others are
not like safe search now this is really
cool here at the bottom this is the API
Explorer not all api's have this but
Flickr does and it's extremely useful
the API Explorer allows us to test the
api's methods before using them in our
apps for this method
it shows the only required argument is
the user ID this is only a half-truth
the API key is also required but in the
API Explorer it automatically includes a
test API key for us for the user ID
argument I'll go ahead and use my user
ID that I've copied ahead of time and
then under the extras argument I'll type
URL underscore M if you read the
documentation the URL underscore M
option specifies that we want the result
of this method to include URLs for
medium images you'll see that in just a
second and last we want to change the
output type to JSON or JavaScript object
notation which we'll talk about more
later in this lesson and let's call the
method and after it's called we can see
the results below and the results we see
this information about photos and then
within photos it looks like there's a
group of individual photos in judging
the total value we see are 13 it appears
there's probably 13 total photos and for
each photo we can see this owner ID
which is the same as my user ID and we
also see an ID for the image if we keep
scrolling to the right there's more
values and here is the URL underscore n
value that we specified in the extras
argument if we copy one of these we can
paste it into the browser to see the
image huh
the URL seems to be not working and I
think it's because these extra slash
characters that have been added before
each of the forward slashes so let me
remove these and I'm removing them
manually now but normally these slash
characters will get removed when we
create an nsurl and code and let's try
this nice this is a picture of Eloise
this is my wife's cat and I'd actually
didn't really like Eloise very much at
first but she's kind of grown on me over
time back on the API Explorer let's
recap on what's happening the results
being returned by this get public photos
method is this JSON data representing
the photos in my public photo stream and
they're being returned as JSON because
that's what we specified here in the
output if we scroll all the way at the
bottom we see this really long and ugly
URL I'll copy this and paste it back
into our browser if we visit this link
we get the exact same thing that we saw
in the API Explorer in fact the URL that
we're using here is extremely similar to
the URL or Apple used to receive data
from Flickr now if we look more closely
at the URL itself we can see the
arguments that we passed in we didn't
pass in the method argument that was
implicit in the Explorer but if we keep
scrolling here to the right past the API
key we can see my user ID here and then
we can see the extras argument and the
URL underscore M there are also these
ampersands that seem to separate the
different argument values
so there's one there there's one there
and you can see them continuing on now
the ampersands themselves are part of a
standard for how arguments are sent in a
URL speaking of standards I should note
that URLs can only be sent over the
internet using the ASCII character set
the ASCII character set is a simple way
of representing characters on a computer
where character values can also be
represented using a number here's some
example ASCII characters and their
corresponding values I've posted a link
in the instructor notes if you want to
read more about them in some cases we
may want to use a URL that contains
characters that are considered unsafe
ASCII characters such as the plus sign
when this happens we have to encode or
escape these unsafe characters into
valid ASCII characters in the URL the
escape version of a plus sign is percent
2b and each of those characters the %
the 2 and the B are valid safe ASCII
characters here's another example this
is a URL that uses flickers Flickr
photos search method one of the
arguments and this method is called text
which is a string representing a text
search in this URL the text is equal to
read % to be blue this is the escaped or
encoded version of the actual text which
is red plus blue since the plus sign is
considered unsafe ASCII it's escaped
with the characters % to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
