keyboard to test out your version of me
me you may have noticed a little problem
especially when editing this bottom text
field wawa the keyboard covers up the
text field and leaves the user stuck one
can avoid this by shifting the entire
view up like so to isolate the keyboard
issue let's build a simple app here I've
got a nap with a text field in an image
the text fields at the bottom and it
gets covered up if we don't shift the
view shifting the view is simple
remember way back when we built click
counter from scratch and code to place
our views we used the frame property
that's the property will use to shift
the main view up more specifically
framed origin why the point where y
equals 0 is at the top of the screen to
move the view up above the keyboard we
subtract the height of the keyboard like
so but how will we know when the
keyboard is about to slide up this is
where NS notifications come in in short
NS notifications provide a way to
announce information throughout a
program across classes to announce
information like the keyboard appearing
or disappearing for more details see the
upcoming text note on the NS
Notification Center kind of like we
subscribe to mailing lists objects have
to subscribe to or observe notifications
in this block of code the view
controller is signing up to be notified
when an event is coming up the event you
I keyboard will show will call this
subscribe to keyboard notifications
method up here and view will appear when
the event you I keyboard will show
occurs the method keyboard will show is
called and that method shifts the frame
but right now the compilers complaining
because we haven't implemented this get
keyboard height method notifications
carry information in a user info
dictionary the UI keyboard will show
notification carries the keyboard frame
in its user info dictionary so that's
how we get the keyboard height so now
let's see this keyboard shift in action
but let's not forget just like with
mailing lists eventually we need to
unsubscribe so here's the method to
unsubscribe from keyboard notifications
and we'll call this unsubscribe method
up here and view will disappear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
