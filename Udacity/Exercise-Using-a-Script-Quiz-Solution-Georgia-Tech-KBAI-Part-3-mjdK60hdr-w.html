think apply to using a script so I chose
four of the seven is applying to using a
script so for problem reduction we saw
earlier that the script breaks down the
overall scene into smaller scenes and
then even further into smaller actions
what that means is that when we're
executing the script and it kind of gets
caught somewhere we can break it down
and see exactly where the script got
caught so we can see exactly where an
expectation was violated classification
we actually already discussed because
classification can help us identify
which script to execute in a given
situation based on what we see so if we
walk into a restaurant and see a hostess
for example we then classify that as a
specific kind of restaurant and launch
the script that goes along with it
although it would take a bigger jump I
can also imagine putting a script in
terms of formal logic especially because
we discussed before that a script can be
considered a plan that has already been
executed once and can be transferred to
new situations so if we're discussing
plans in the form of formal logic we may
also be able to put scripts in those
same kind of terms in terms of what
they're asserting is true for a given
state of the script so if we can put
plans in the form of formal logic we can
also imagine rewriting our script in the
form of formal logic that would give us
a script in terms of what different
elements of the script assert about the
state of the world at different points
of the scripts execution finally we can
also see understanding applying pretty
directly to scripts because it helps us
disambiguate similar events in different
situations so to go with a jokes example
about receiving the bill right when you
sit down the table understanding talks
about how we can disambiguate that event
based on what else has happened before
and after I didn't see the other three
as being as applicable to scripts for a
couple different reasons for generating
tests and means and analysis these are
problem-solving methods and as we talked
about with planning in the previous
exercise scripts are often used when we
already have a solution and we simply
need to execute it case-based reasoning
keeps things at the level of individual
cases that can be adapted to our current
problem whereas script serve as an
abstraction over a number of cases so I
don't really see case based reasoning
applying as much here either this is a
good day we thank you for sharing this
note the generator and test in case
based reasoning might be applicable to
the user scripts after all so one can
imagine a situation where there are
large number of available the
what has to decide which of the scrip
should I use for a particular situation
and may not be able to classify the
situation directly into scripts and with
that case the robot may pick a script
generated try it out see if it works if
it does not pick another one also case
based reasoning is connected to the
application of scripts in the sense that
both case based reasoning and script
based reasoning are extremely memory
intensive what both of them are saying
is that memory often supplies most of
the answer like we said earlier when we
were discussing case based reasoning we
don't think as much as we think we do
most of the time memory gives us the
answer the difference of course like
David pointed out is at cases there for
two instances where scripts are
abstractions over instances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
