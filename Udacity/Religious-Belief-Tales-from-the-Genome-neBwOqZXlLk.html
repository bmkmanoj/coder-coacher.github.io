there are traits that aren't very
heritable meaning that they don't have a
high heritability for example
monozygotic twins can easily be
discordant with regards to religious
belief this touches back more on what we
discussed in less than 1 when we first
introduced the idea of traits and we
discussed the idea of a learned versus
in 8 trait in this case we're talking
about a lower heritability meaning that
it's more of a learned trait it has more
to do with your environmental factors
such as which culture a person might be
raised in so in other words the low
concordance rate of religious belief
between monozygotic twins results in a
lower heritability so let's think about
it again on our scale of heritability
religious belief would be down here
because the variation we see in our
population of people who believe in
different things has very little to do
with any kind of genetic factor at all
it's all based on how this person was
raised where is it the other end of the
spectrum we have one of the highest
heritabilities for eye color because
this is largely controlled by your
genetics the environment has almost
nothing to do with this trait and then
we could have a trait somewhere in the
middle like lung cancer which we know
can be heritable due to genetic factors
but in the human population we see a lot
of variability in this trait due to
environmental components such as
cigarette smoking so remember and our
journey to better understand complex
traits when we use our twin studies to
determine or estimate an amount of
heritability we're much better off
following up genetically on those traits
that appear to have a larger genetic
component than those that don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
