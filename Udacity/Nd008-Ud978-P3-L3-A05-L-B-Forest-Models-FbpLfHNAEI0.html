version of the example we just talked
about we generated a force model in
order to predict the unknown data from
the employees who did not respond let's
apply this model to a particular
employee who lives 1.5 miles away from
work to illustrate how the force model
will work remember the trees here are
simplified to demonstrate the concept
for the first tree a random sample the
data is taken and a tree is created from
it here is the tree since the employee
we were trying to predict lose 1.5 miles
away this tree would predict that she
has a fifty percent chance of driving to
work thirty percent chance of taking
public transportation and a twenty
percent chance of walking or biking now
another tree is generated from a
different random sample here is that
tree in this tree or employee is
predicted to have a twenty percent
chance of driving thirty percent chance
of using public transportation and a
fifty percent chance of walking or
biking a third tree is generated from a
different random sample here is that
tree now in this tree our employee is
predicted to have a thirty percent
chance of driving twenty percent chance
of using public transit and a fifty
percent chance of walking or biking in a
force model hundreds of trees like this
would be creative and then the results
of each would be averaged to make a
prediction let's average based off these
three trees to make a prediction so
driving is fifty percent plus twenty
percent plus thirty percent divided by
three so it's thirty three percent
likely to be driving the public transit
was thirty percent thirty percent and
twenty percent when you divide that by
three that's twenty-seven percent likely
to be public transportation and then
walking and biking had at twenty percent
fifty percent and a fifty percent chance
divided by 3 which equals forty percent
so you can see that if we had only used
the first tree that because of
overfitting it may have had a very
different prediction than the forest
model it would have predicted most
likely our employee drove by using a
forest technique it predicted that she
most likely walked or biked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
