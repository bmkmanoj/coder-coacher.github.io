see a Rube Goldberg machine at the
science fair if our app were a Rube
Goldberg machine then an instance of a
class would be one of its moving parts a
class is a unit that we use to package
together related data and functionality
a class is made up of properties and
methods as you can see here in this
simple movie class the properties are
title director and release year and it
only has one method and an it method
we'll talk about the specifics of
initialization shortly for now just know
that every class needs an initialization
method notice that the properties are
generally defined at the top of the
class followed by the methods here's
another class you've seen before the
movie archive class this one has a
property that's an array of movie
objects and in addition to its init
method it has the familiar method filter
by year you can see that apart from the
placement of the code between these
curly braces defining properties in a
class is no different from defining any
other variable or constant and defining
methods in a class is no different from
defining global functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
