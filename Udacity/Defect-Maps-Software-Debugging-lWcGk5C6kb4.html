reports a problem in the problem
database or a developer for that matter
or anyone eventually a developer or a
team of developers will take a look at
the problem and make an appropriate fix
to the program such fixes are also
stored in a database namely a version
database where all changes are stored
such a version database is also called a
change database the repository or the
configuration management system a
version control system pick your choice
there's plenty of version control
systems around these days which helps
story these changes and the resulting
versions since using a version database
is the first thing to use in any kind of
civilized software development I will
simply assume that you use such a thing
on a daily base anyway an interesting
thing happens however when you link the
information from the problem database to
the information from the version
database let's assume the problem
database has a problem report number 347
where it says remove HTML markup fails
and let's assume the version database
has recorded a change to a function
named remove HTML markup in precisely
this location with a comment that this
now closes problem report number 347
which is a change which may well have
been made after the problem was
initially submitted we can now go and
and relate the change to the actual
problem report because the change
message has the actual number of the
problem report in here and we can use
that to retrieve the precise problem
report since we also know where the
change has been applied namely in this
part of the file we now have a link from
the problem database to a specific place
in the code this allows us for
every piece of code to identify the
problems that were associated with it
what we do is we take the piece of code
look at all the changes that were made
and look at the problems that these
changes refer to we can then for
instance find that remove HTML markup
over the history of this very course has
had three fixes until it finally worked
three fixes until a function actually
works is pretty bad we should really
worry about the quality of our coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
