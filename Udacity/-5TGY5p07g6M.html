paper is the Python standard library
imagine that this is what we got when we
downloaded Python inside Python is a
file named web browser and inside web
browser is a function called open now
this is the function that allowed us to
play the YouTube video much like web
browser
there is another file or module inside
the Python standard library it's called
time and time has several functions
defined inside of it
two of them are C time which gives you
the current time and sleep which
suspends program animation for a little
bit now here's a plot how this function
sleep actually suspends or pauses
program flow for a given number of
seconds we don't really know how it does
that behind the scenes in much the same
way how this function opened opens up a
web browser to play a YouTube video for
us we don't quite know how it does that
behind the scenes also that detail is
hidden from us and this hiding of detail
in programming is called abstraction now
this idea of abstraction is a really
powerful one in programming because it
allows us to focus on the program that
we actually want to write which is the
take a break program and it empowers us
to use these functions simply by reading
their documentation so let's read some
documentation now and see these
functions actually exist in the Python
standard library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
