wanted to find the days between dates
2013 January 24 and 2013 June 29 if we
were going to do this as a human we
might look at a calendar and I happen to
have a calendar handy and thanks my
auntie in Belfast for sending me the
calendar and we could count the days
using the calendar so let's look at the
calendar we have our starting day is
January 24 and we might count the days
between January 24 how many days we have
left in January so there would be one
two three four five six seven days left
in January so there'd be seven days in
January then we have all of February all
of February is 28 days then we have all
of March 31 days all of April 30 days
all of May 31 days and then we have June
we don't want to count all of June's
because we're stopping on June 29 so
we're gonna add 29 days from June and if
we sum all those up we should get our
answer and as a human we know how to
compute sums by entering the numbers
into Google and we get 156</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
