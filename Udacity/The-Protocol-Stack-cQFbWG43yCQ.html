protocol stacks are made of layers where
each layer depends on abstractions
provided by the layer below let's take
another look up and down that stack to
see where we are as a developer you're
usually working at one particular layer
of abstraction at a time but it's
important to know about the lower layers
because the way they work affects the
way they can fail and what strange
things can happen to your application
web applications rely on HTTP to send
requests about resources and get
responses you use libraries like flask
or requests to build HTTP applications
some ideas that are visible at the HTTP
layer include URLs for resources and
methods cookies HTTP verbs any
misbehavior of lower layers is mostly
visible at the HTTP layer as errors and
high latency requests that fail or they
take unreasonably long to complete HTTP
is implemented in browsers and in web
servers as well as in proxies and
firewalls and some other tools like that
that code uses TCP but the code that
says in order to send an HTTP request
connect to the server on port 80 and
transmit the following bytes as part of
the web browser and the corresponding
code for understanding HTTP requests and
sending responses as part of the web
server web apps don't need to reinvent
that they just make use of the features
the browser and server already implement
but the browser up here doesn't tell
your Wi-Fi or Ethernet adapter down here
exactly what to transmit to your router
the browser makes use of the TCP
networking services that your operating
system provides connecting to a server
on a port and having a reliable stream
of bytes between that client and server
is a feature provided by your OS as TCP
implementation whether you're on Mac or
Windows or Linux or something else
modern OS is provide TCP built-in user
program such as browsers just have to
use them within the OSS networking code
TCP in turn relies on the lower-level
Protocol IP to deliver packets between
hosts and to pass them through the
intermediate hops the routers an IP in
turn relies on hardware like Wi-Fi or
Ethernet and device drivers to
physically shift data between devices on
the same
physical network now not all Network
applications use TCP ping uses ICMP DNS
primarily uses UDP has to a number of
other things like the network time
protocol that keeps your time and date
in sync but all of these underlying
protocols are provided by the operating
system we'll see a lot more about these
in this lesson one more thing be careful
what layer you're talking about there
are a lot of terms in common between
them for example a Wi-Fi connection or
associating with a particular Wi-Fi
access point has nothing particularly to
do with a TCP connection also known as a
session and a TCP session has nothing
particularly to do with a web user
session identified by for instance
session cookies on a logged in user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
