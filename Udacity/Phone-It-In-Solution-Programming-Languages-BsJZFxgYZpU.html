we definitely want 0 through 9 plus to
get the first part of any phone number
what about this regular expression we
have 0 through 9 plus and then as many
times as you like we have a hyphen and
then 0 through 9 plus again as kind of a
group this actually works quite well
however if we were to put a star here
instead of a plus this one accepts
negative six x just skipping this part
doing this part once negative 6 and then
we're done so we don't like this and as
we've mentioned regular expressions
admit room for creativity what if I want
to do this interesting grouping at the
beginning what if I say you can have as
many of these 08 hyphen 78 hyphen 88
hyphen things as you want as long as you
end with some final numbers this one
also works you may remember the
hyphenated word problem we had from
before this hyphenated phone number
problem is actually quite similar but
now that we know how to do grouping with
parentheses it's much easier to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
