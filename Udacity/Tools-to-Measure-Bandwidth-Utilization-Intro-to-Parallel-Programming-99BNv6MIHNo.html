about this the way that I just described
to you right so we sort of walked her
way through we figured out what kind of
bandwidth we were getting and what
percentage of theoretical peak that was
we saw that it was really quite low and
we said why would we be getting low
bandwidth to global memory well the
first thing you always look at there is
coalescing and then we inspected the
code and convinced ourselves that yes
there's bad coalescing happening when we
write to the output matrix but I also
want to make the point that you don't
have to do this from scratch every time
right doing all these calculations is a
little bit like rubbing two sticks
together to start a fire it's good to
know how but there are tools to help you
do this the tool that we're gonna be
using is called insight this is an
Nvidia product
there's also third-party products maybe
I'll give some links to those in the
supplementary material and if you're
using Linux or a Mac like I'm using then
you'll be using the insight Eclipse
edition if you were using Windows you'd
be using inside Visual Studio edition
these are integrated debuggers and
profilers they're full-blown development
environments the part that we're going
to use is called the nvidia visual
profiler or in VPP let's fire that up
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
