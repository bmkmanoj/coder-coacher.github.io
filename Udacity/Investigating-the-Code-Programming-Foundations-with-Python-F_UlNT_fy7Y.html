anything is to google it so I typed in
Python keyword from here I scanned all
of the results that were available and
then from there I landed on this webpage
by the way the link to this website is
also available in the instructor notes
now this webpage says that pythons from
statement lets you import specific
attributes from a module so I guess it
allows you to say from module or file
name import something so I guess our
code then means that from something
called Twilio dot rest we want to import
Twilio rest client now this got me
curious about what these things called
Twilio dressed and Twilio rest client
work so then i went back to google and
tried to find out how Twilio was
actually implemented so I typed in
Twilio Python code then I looked through
these results and I got to this website
called github here I could read all of
the code that actually makes Twilio work
behind the scenes by the way this link
is also available in the instructor
notes now in the code for Twilio I found
that there was this folder called Twilio
so I clicked on it now inside that
folder is another folder called rest and
within rest there is a Python file which
if we look through we will find that
there is a class called Twilio
restclient inside it so when we write
this line of code from Twilio dot rest
import Twilio rest client what we are
telling the computer is hey inside
Twilio there is a folder called rest and
inside that folder is a class called
Twilio rest client and we are going to
use that class inside our code and if we
go back and look in our code here is how
we are using that class Twilio rest
client now you know if we were writing
this code from scratch we probably won't
have written this line of code we would
have modified it to say from Twilio
import rest now with this line of code
what we are telling the computer is hey
inside the folder Twilio is another
folder called rest import that because
we are going to use that in our program
and we know that inside the folder rest
is the class Twilio rest client so I
would now access that class by saying
rest dot Twilio rest client let me save
and run this program one more time to
see if it still works alright here's my
phone and let's see if I get a text
message anytime soon
aha there's the text message it seems
like our program still works so in the
next video what I want to do is revisit
the idea of how Twilio rest and Twilio
rest client are related with one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
