does all of this mean for Alice Bob and
Carol we have already seen that the
problems they're trying to solve are
contained in NP and so what we could now
try is to show that their problems are
actually and P complete and to do that
what we need to do is we need to reduce
sat to one of their problems and we're
going to do this with clique it's also
possible to do it with vertex cover or
independent set
but clique is actually one one of the
easier ones to see and now what we need
to show is that for any given instance
of Sat
so we're for any boolean formula if you
will we can transform it into an input
for the clique problem in polynomial
time
such that clique as a decision problem
will say yes if the boolean formula has
a satisfying assignment and now
otherwise and once we achieve this then
we know that clique is np-complete and
since we have already seen that there
are polynomial time reductions between
clique vertex cover and independent set
if clique is np-complete then these two
problems here are also np-complete which
of course will mean that not only Bob
will be very unhappy about this but
Alice and Carol will be in this together
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
