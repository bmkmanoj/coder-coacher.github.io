the quantity a squared plus a minus 1 is
correct I hope these are getting easier
we know that LCD must be a times a minus
1 since these are the only factors that
appear in our denominators we multiply
the fraction by the LCD / the LCD so we
really multiply each of these terms by
the number a times a minus 1 for our
first term the A's reduced to 1 so we're
left with a plus 3 times a minus 1 for
the second term the a minus 1s cancel
leaving us with negative 4 times a and
this is why you want to be really
careful to pay attention to this sign we
have negative for a not positive for it
and in our denominator we're left with a
times a which is a squared + 1 times n
minus 1 we add that as our second term
in the denominator if we multiply these
two together we'll get a squared plus to
a minus 3 our denominator just has the
terms a squared plus 1 a minus 1 we
combine our like terms to get negative
2a for our numerator now we definitely
want to try to see if we can simplify
this more but I know I can I can't find
factors of negative 1 that sum to
positive 1 so we're really done the
numerator can be factored but again this
doesn't help us out since we can't
cancel a factor that appears here with
one that appears here this is our final
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
