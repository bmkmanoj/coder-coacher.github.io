and I am an assistant instructor here at
Udacity and welcome to coffee break
we at Udacity think a lot about pedagogy
how our students learn what kind of
information they bring to our classes
and today I want to share a story with
you about learning and unlearning things
before working for Udacity I used to be
a great success I instill and today I
want to tell you a story from inside my
science classroom and this story is
about unlearning things I remember the
school had just reopened after a really
long summer break and we were talking
about trees inside my science classroom
and I thought to myself what better
place to talk about trees then in the
presence of some so I took my entire
class which is a group of about thirty
boys and girls took them all to a nearby
park which had a lot of trees it is
there where we saw a tree stump that had
been chopped off and you could actually
see the rings inside the tree stop my
students were very curious about the
Rings I told them that there was a
relationship between the Rings and the
age of the tree so if you added up all
of the rings in the tree stump that
number was probably very close to the
age of the tree all the students got
very busy starting to count the the
number of rings in the stump a few
months passed by and now winter is fast
approaching and imagine this I'm inside
my science classroom with thirty kids
who are sitting on chairs I'm in front
of the class and I'm using a projector
to show my students images of plants but
in the desert environment one of those
images I remember was off the saguaro
cactus I tell my students that the
saguaros cactus is native to Arizona
grows up to be really tall 50 or 60 feet
tall and that it lives for a really long
time as a matter of fact certain species
of
saguaro cactus live up to 150 years old
it was then that this boy his name is
SID he raised his hand gingerly he was
sitting in the back he stood up and he
said so does this mean that the saguaro
cactus has 150 rings in its stem Sid the
12 year old boy had developed a mental
model and of course this mental model
was developed due to past experiences
and previous instruction he had
developed a mental model in which he
believed that all plants and all trees
had rings inside of them we at Udacity
are very curious to hear from you if you
ever experienced something like that
something that Sid experienced in my
science classroom that day has it ever
happened to you that you've tried to
learn something but you had to unlearn
something from your past before in other
words has it ever happened to you that
you were trying to acquire a new piece
of information but something that you
learned in your past what was either
conflicting with or presenting
resistance to acquiring this new piece
of information we would love to hear
your story feel free to add your story
and your comments to the comments box
and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
