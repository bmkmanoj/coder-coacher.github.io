have seen zero tokens so far know when
we've seen zero tokens the red dot has
to be really far to the left currently
the red dot suggests that we've already
seen in E and A plus the plus alone
takes up one token so we can't be here
alright but could we have just seen one
token well since we've seen an
expression and a plus and the smallest
expression is itself one token we need
to have seen at least two so we can't be
here however we could have seen just two
if the input so far was in two plus
we've seen two tokens and one of our
states would be exactly this one int
reduces to or can be rewritten from E
using one of the rules in our grammar
the plus is a terminal so it always
stays the same and here's where we are
how about three this is a little
trickier in our grammar if we had seen
three input tokens our red dot wouldn't
be right here after the plus it would be
over one more under something a little
different would happen it's very hard to
have a string in the language of this
grammar where after three tokens you've
just seen a plus but surprisingly for
tokens does let's make a little room and
take a look and see why II can be
rewritten by int he can be rewritten by
int this plus stays the same so the
three of these together e plus e are
themselves one more e so conceptually
from the parsers point of view what
we've seen so far is in E and A plus
assuming we've done all these rewrites
over here on the left and we're looking
for a little more input so in fact we
could have seen for input tokens int
plus into plus and been in this parsing
state it's might seem a little
counterintuitive but remember the glory
of parsing of the glory of context-free
grammars is that a very concise grammar
notation stands for an infinite number
of strings even this very simple grammar
has an infinite number of strings in its
language so it shouldn't be surprising
that longer strings than two can have
very concise power states
five tokens isn't going to work for the
same reason that three tokens didn't
work the dot would have to be in another
place however if we were to add a few
more in this trick that I've done here
of reducing int goes to int ghost in if
I had one two three four five six tokens
I could also be in the same state so 2 4
6 8 the pattern repeats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
