feeling lucky where we wanted to modify
the search engine such that it returned
the highest ranking result we want to
create a new function that orders the
results according to the ranking now
this is now in order to do this what we
need to solve is sorting we need to be
able to sort the pages according to the
ranking this is a very well studied
problem and a canonical example of
algorithms for the purposes of this
course and the kind of reinforced
recursion we're going to use the
quicksort algorithm quicksort is
interesting because it's incredibly
elegant it's recursive and it happens to
be one of the fastest ways you can do
sorting and we're going to do it in just
a few lines of code before we get
started I'll go quickly over how quick
sort works let's say we have this list
of five elements and we're going to go
through the quicksort algorithm the
first thing we need to do is to choose a
pivot point a lot of implementations use
a random one but it really doesn't
matter if we assume that the data were
given is randomly distributed so let's
just choose the first element as our
pivot point that makes coding it simpler
and it's also a little simpler to go
through what we're going to do now is
divided the rest of the elements
according to things that are smaller
than the pivot point and things that are
greater than the pivot point so let's do
that so we have our pivot point to and
now we're going to go through the rest
of the elements and decide whether or
not they're greater than or less than
two a pretty simple operation so one is
less than two we're going to add it to
this list 8 is greater than 20 is less
than two notice how I didn't bother with
the ordering of the sub list we're going
to take care of that by recurring
quicksort onto the sub list of each side
nine is greater than two and we're done
what we have is kind of a partially
sorted list everything that is less than
two is on the left side of this
everything that's greater than 2 is on
the right side so what we're going to do
is we want to redo the same thing to the
left side the same thing to the right
side and in the end once we sorted
everything we combine them all together
and we have a sorted list so
go through that real quick so here one
is the pivot point you get 10 is less
than one here eight is the pivot point
nine is greater than eight and we're
done here we're also done here and now
we're left with single element lists we
do quicksort on each of these and a list
of one element is sorted so we're done
sorting at the bottom we now append on
the way up so the end result of all
these appending will be our sorted list
and just to finish our list let's just
say we called it conquer hopefully this
gives you an idea of what we're doing so
let's go to the code and it might become
a little clearer if you're confused so
our ordered search takes in three
parameters be index the ranking of the
pages and the key word that we're
searching for I'm going to look up the
pages that are associated with that key
word and then we want a quick sort the
pages according to the rankings that was
passed in two ordered search this is
another function that will have to
define so I'm taking in two lists the
URLs and the rankings of those URLs
which is stored as a dictionary so if I
didn't get any pages passed in or was an
empty list or whatnot then I'm just
going to not do anything and stop right
here this saves some cases that add a
little bit of complexity later on if we
take care of it now so the first thing
I'm going to do is find the pivot point
which is the ranking of the first page
that's basically how we did it in the
example I went through we initialize our
two lists the better lists and the worst
list and now we're going to go through
each page and to put them in the correct
list accordingly one thing you might
notice that I didn't go through every
page I skipped the first page that makes
the code a little bit simpler because
I've already included the page as the
pivot point once we put the pages in the
correct lists we're going to recur in
order to get the list concatenation to
work appropriately you need to put this
pages into another list and this is the
appending that I showed at the end and
this is the recurring that I showed
earlier and this is all quicksort is we
got what is it 14 lines of code 13 lines
of code and we could even save a little
bit here in the air if we wanted to but
we're just going to recur
and we're done to go through it real
quickly if we have one page in our list
or if there are no pages in our list
then it's considered sorted and return
it right away otherwise we find our
pivot point which one he uses the first
element and for the rest of them we're
going to put them in the appropriate
worse or better list if they're better
or worse ranked we're then going to
recur on each of our sub lists and once
that's done we're going to append them
all together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
