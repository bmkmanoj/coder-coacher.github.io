and I have been with Georgia Tech for 25
years before that I was an industrial
software developer both for big
companies like Bell Laboratories and
Sperry and for a startup called
interactive systems since coming to
Georgia Tech I've also worked closely
with industry both with a large
telecommunications vendor and with
several startup companies throughout I
have tried to combine academic software
engineering theory with everyday
industrial practice
I am the developer of CS 63 10 and have
taught it many times with on-site in
Atlanta and remotely in Korea and France
I also participated in the planning and
development of other software
engineering courses here at Georgia Tech
including the course on software process
that is part of the arms program and
other courses on software generation and
software requirements one thing that
characterizes these courses is their
emphasis on learning by doing
particularly for design no amount of
academic knowledge can make up for the
hard-won experience of actually building
things you will have that opportunity in
the project portion of this course you
can have a look at my teaching
philosophy by following the link in the
instructors notes for this lesson
I now want you to meet Jarod Parks you
will see him in some of the lesson
videos acting as a typical student
trying to solve the exercises and asking
questions that arise Jared can you tell
us a little about yourself absolutely as
Spencer said my name is Jared parks and
I'll be working with you and Spencer
throughout this course in terms of
software experience I've worked in a
number of different places in my career
I've worked in the telecommunications
company and there I tested and
programmed new features for VDSL routing
equipment
I've also programmed a number of small
video games and prototypes for the
biotech community and I own a web and
mobile development company with my twin
brother James more importantly though is
I want to help Spencer bring a new
exciting feel to this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
