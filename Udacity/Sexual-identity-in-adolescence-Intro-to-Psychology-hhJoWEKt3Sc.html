figuring out who they are attracted to
and who is attracted to them sexual
identity involves figuring out who we
are sexually what we like and don't like
and who were attracted to recent surveys
of American teens have reported that
around eighty eight percent of teenagers
described themselves as predominantly
heterosexual about one to two percent of
teens described themselves as
predominantly homosexual or bisexual and
about ten percent of teens described
themselves as being confused about their
sexual orientation
now the formation of your identity also
revolves around experimenting and trying
other adult type behaviors such as
drinking alcohol or doing drugs as a
psychologist Erik Erikson put it being a
teen involves forming our identity in at
least three main areas sexual
ideological and occupational we form our
identity through our relationships
that's the sexual part our political and
religious beliefs
that's the ideological part and through
career choices
that's the occupational part to put it
simply being a teenager means trying to
figure out who we like what we believe
and what career is best suited for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
