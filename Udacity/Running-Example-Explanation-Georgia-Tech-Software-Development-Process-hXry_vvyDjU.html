lesson in which we discuss the basic
object-oriented concepts and we started
to look at how to perform
object-oriented analysis in the second
part of the lesson I will introduce UML
and we will perform the object-oriented
analysis steps that we just saw using an
example a course management system so
before getting to the second part let me
introduce the example as we mentioned
before the first step is to start from a
textual description of the system that
we need to analyze and that we need to
build so that's exactly what I'm going
to do so I'm just going to read through
this description that then we will reuse
throughout the rest of the lesson the
registration manager sets up the
curriculum for a semester using a
scheduling algorithm and the
registration manager here is the
Registrar so we will refer to the
registration manager both as a
registration manager and as register in
the rest of the lesson one course might
have multiple course offerings which is
pretty standard each course offering has
a number location and the time
associated with it students select four
primary courses and two alternative
courses by submitting a registration
form students may use the course
management system to add or drop courses
for a period of time after registration
professors use the system to receive
their course offering rosters finally
users of the registration system are
assigned passwords which are used for
login validation so as you can see this
is kind of a high-level description of a
standard course management system so if
you ever use the course management
system you will recognize some of the
functionality described here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
