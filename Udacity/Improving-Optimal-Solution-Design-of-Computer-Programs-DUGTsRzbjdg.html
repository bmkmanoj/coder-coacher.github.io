just copying out the version from P win
and making sure it fits with this new
definition of the parameters so if me +
pending is greater than goal then the
probability is 1 otherwise if you wins
probability is 0 otherwise we compute
the probability of winning by rolling
and if there are no pending then we
better roll because if we try to hold
will get stuck in an infinite loop so
the return value is just the probability
of rolling if there's no pending of
pending at 0 if there is a pending then
we want to take the maximum result of
either rolling or dealing with holding
now how do we do well we've defined our
new p win to function we can call that
on the same initial state and that'll do
all the computations and cash them and
it turns out it takes just about a
quarter of a second so it's three times
faster than the previous version that
took three quarters of a second and if
you see the probability that it computes
it's exactly the same and and just to be
sure you should probably go through and
pick out a bunch of other states and
test those I actually did it for all
states and showed that all of them
compute exactly the same function then
we can look at the size of the cache and
see that that's about half as much a
little bit less than half as much and
that's where we're getting our speed up
we're only computing half as much so it
goes a lot faster and there's always a
choice when you get a speed up like this
you can put it in the bank or you can
spend it so we can put it in the bank
and say now we can do in a quarter of a
second what previously took three
quarters of a second or we can spend it
here and spending it by increasing the
goal to 60 rather than 40 so much more
computation to do then I reload all my
code so that the caches are flushed and
do a time call again and this time it's
about three quarters of a second and I
can do in the same amount of time which
I could only handle a goal up to 40 now
it can handle the goal up to 60 and note
that the probability is a little bit
lower than it was before if the goal is
farther away than the advantage of going
first is a little bit less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
