must be heterozygous for this to be true
for this to be true at all we know that
the child must have to affected alleles
i'm going to show two minuses here minus
minus so that means the father had to
have one copy and the mother had
everyone copy because neither of them
are affected but they pass it on to
their offspring so they must be
heterozygous for this for them to be
heterozygous they must have gotten it
from one of their parents in this case
each of them their parents one of their
parents related would have had to have
been heterozygous and this is when the
must comes in only one of the great
grandparents must be heterozygous right
so must be heterozygous must be
heterozygous must be heterozygous must
be heterozygous in this case in this
scenario one of the grandparents must be
heterozygous right it could be the great
grandfather or it could be the great
grandmother but you wouldn't actually
put both because they don't both have to
be heterozygous for this to be true I
know this is a little tricky and it's
getting caught up in semantics but I'm
what I'm really trying to do here is
test whether or not you understand how
these alleles are passed on how it gets
complicated when inbreeding is involved
and as a genetic counselor just as a
geneticist in general understanding what
can and can't be true and what must and
must not be true again remember that one
of the assumptions for all of these
pedigree problems is that anybody mating
in from the outside like these two males
here we assume to be homozygous
wild-type unless indicated otherwise and
in this case we had no reason to think
otherwise so we do a sooner homozygous
wild-type so the answer would be these
four individuals in one of the great
grandparents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
