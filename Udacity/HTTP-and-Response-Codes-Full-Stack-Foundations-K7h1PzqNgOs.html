tell servers what they want by using an
HDTV also known as an HTTP method there
are nine HTTP verbs in the current HTTP
specification the two most commonly used
methods for websites though are get and
post a get request can be thought of as
the client telling the server get me
some information that you have or a post
can be thought of as the client saying I
want to modify some information that you
have gets are sometimes called safe
methods since they are only used to
retrieve existing data from the database
or as posts call for data to be added
remove or changed on a server
we know that the client prefixes request
to the server with HTTP verbs so how
does the server reply status codes are
the server's replied to a client as to
what happened after a specific request
in addition to a status code a server
can also supply any requested resources
the client requested such as HTML CSS
and JavaScript and media files such as
images and audio some common response
codes are 200 which indicates a
successful get request 301 which is a
successful post request and 404 which
indicates that we were looking for a
file on the server and the server
couldn't find it in the next section
we'll put all of these concepts together
as we create our own web server and
Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
