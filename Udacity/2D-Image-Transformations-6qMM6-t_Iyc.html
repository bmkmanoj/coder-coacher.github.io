transformations again let's look at the
simple equation that we're looking at
let's say I create the simple equation
here which basically takes a scale in x
and y directions X SX and sy and
basically what that means is that this
image now would be scaled by the
parameters SX and sy and they would of
course be scaled around the origin point
of the image zero and zero I mean there
would be a linear scaling in that
direction here is an interesting
transformation and matrix what would
happen when I apply this if you think
about it basically what it's going to do
is gonna flip the image in one direction
so basically what it's going to do is
when I have the y axis going this way
it's gonna flip all of the values under
this side that is the right side of the
image to the left and all the left ones
to the right so basically that would be
a mirror operation if I put minus 1 on
both of them that would be a mirror over
the origin so basically we'll flip both
an x axis and the y axis to generate a
mirror flipped image here is another
interesting one which basically now I
put the terms on the two off diagonal
terms and we would refer this as shear
so shear in X and Sharon Y would give us
an image that would be sheared that
basically would kind of have the impact
of kind of having the top probe image
kind of move towards the left and that's
our top part of the image moving towards
the right and bottom moving to the left
will show examples of that in a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
