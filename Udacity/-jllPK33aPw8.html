movie one more time and now I am really
curious and figuring out what happens
behind the scenes when I create the
instance called avatar by providing
these four pieces of information these
by the way are the movies name its
storyline the link to the movies poster
image and the link to its YouTube URL by
the way the last two of these two things
are clearly not links or URLs they sound
more like English phrases and I did that
because there wasn't enough room on the
screen for me to add the full URLs or
links so as soon as we run this line of
code the init function gets called self
in that case is itself or the instance
being created which is avatar the
variable movie title gets the correct
value which is avatar the movie
storyline variable gets the correct
value the poster image gets the correct
value also and finally the trailer
YouTube gets the correct trailer youtube
link okay so far so good
now once in it gets called and all of
these four arguments receive their
appropriate values all of the variables
that are associated with the instance
Avatar they get initialized
appropriately so at this point if I say
avatar dot storyline the program will
print out the correct value okay so now
I'm going to take a small step back and
tie together a few pieces of information
that we've been seeing here is our class
movie and after defining the class movie
I created two of its instances Toy Story
and avatar I could have created more
instances but for now I've just created
these two now when I created these two
instances what I was really doing behind
the scenes is I was setting aside space
for each instance and within that space
each instance had their own copy of
variables these variables include title
storyline poster image URL and trailer
YouTube URL here our toy story's
variables and here our avatars variables
now because these variables are unique
to each instance of class movie these
variables are called instance variable
and that phrase instance variables is
another new word that I will add to our
list of words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
