answer this especially depending on your
age here's one way so I'm going to
define the variable age and I'm gonna
use my age in spirit which is seven and
then we'll multiply that by the number
of days in a year but let's also define
a variable for the number of days in a
year
and we could use 365 if we want to
account for leap years it would be more
accurate to use 365 and a quarter it's
one quarter of the years are leap years
and to compute the number of days that
I've been alive we can multiply those
two values and print out the result so
let's try that in the Python interpreter
so here we've defined our two variables
we have age is seven not my real age in
case you're wondering and days in year
is 365 and a quarter so well multiply
those two to print out the result which
is 2556 and three-quarter days of course
to do this more accurately we need to
use a real age and are actually just
probably not an exact number of years
unless it's your birthday today
in which case happy birthday but
otherwise you need to add the number of
days since your birthday to get a more
accurate number I'll change my age to my
real age and I will add the number of
days since my birthday which is 268 if
you're watching this on the day it's
released and then we get my age in days
is fourteen thousand eight hundred
seventy eight which seems pretty old</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
