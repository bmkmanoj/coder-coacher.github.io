the username and password with every
request that was protected by the auth
dot log and required decorator this is
inconvenient and can be seen as a
security risk even if the transport is
secure HTTP since the client application
must have those credentials stored
without encryption to be able to send
them with these requests when rendering
HTML pages with flask we had the ability
to use a login session object to store
information about the state of the
client between requests flask did this
by creating an encrypted cookie for us
that the browser could have pin to each
HTTP requests but since our restful api
may not always work with a browser or a
client that can securely store and
transmit cookies we need another method
for storing and communicating
credentials a popular solution to this
problem is to create tokens a token is a
string of the server generates for the
client that can be passed along inside
an HTTP request the idea is that the
client application exchanges
authentication credentials for an
authentication token and in subsequent
requests just sends the token when the
server receives the token it can then
look up the credentials of the user and
determine whether or not it is
authorized to the information it is
requesting tokens are usually given out
with an expiration time after which they
become invalid and a new token needs to
be obtained the potential damage that
can be caused if a token is leaked is
much smaller due to the short lifespan a
server can easily determine if a token
is too old and decide to reject it if it
doesn't view it is valid so how do we go
about creating tokens a straightforward
implementation is to generate a random
sequence of characters of certain length
that is stored with the user and the
password in the database possibly with
an expiration date as well the token
then become sort of a plaintext password
in that it can easily be verified with
the string comparison plus a check of
its expiration date a more elaborate
implementation that requires no
server-side storage is to use a
cryptographically signed message as a
token this has the advantage that the
information related to the token namely
the user for which the token was
generated is encoded in the token itself
and protected against tampering with a
strong cryptographic signature flask
uses a similar approach to
secure cookies this implementation is
based on a package called it's dangerous
in the next video we will use the it's
dangerous library as we take on adding
token generation and verification to our
user model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
