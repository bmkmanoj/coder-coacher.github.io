or the min or the second largest or the
second-to-last smallest these are all
examples of what are called order
statistics so statistics some are
summaries of the values in a list that
depend on the order if they were sorted
so this notion is generalizing min and
Max so the min can be expressed as order
statistic 1 the second smallest element
of the list is sort of statistic - the
median is order statistic again over to
say floor the second largest is order
statistic n minus 1 and the max is order
statistic n so to give you a chance to
play with this idea a little bit of
order statistics I'd like you to write
some Python code to find the second most
popular name so I'm going to give you
the the list of the most popular names
given to babies in the US born in 1995
it's why OB for a year of birth 1995
text and take a look at the file you
should be able to so download this and
take a look at the format it's pretty
simple it's the name and and the sex and
the number of essentially a measure of
how popular the name is and what you
want to find is the second most popular
female name given in the u.s. in 1995
once your program is completed it should
be able to help put the name and I want
you to just check off the name that your
program returns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
