engineering which is the field within
software engineering that deals with
establishing the needs of stakeholders
that are to be solved by the software so
why is this phase so important in
general the cost of correcting an error
depends on the number of subsequent
decisions that are based on it
therefore errors made in understanding
requirements have the potential for
greatest cost because many other design
decisions depend on them and many other
follow-up decisions depend on them in
fact if we look at this diagram which is
again a qualitative diagram where we
have the cost of error correction over
the phase in which the error is
discovered we can see that if we
discover an error in requirements it's
going to cost us 1 if we find it in
design it's going to cost us 5 and so on
and so forth and the cost grows
dramatically as we go from the
requirement phase to the maintenance
phase why because of course if we
discover a problem here we'll have to
undo a lot of the decisions that were
made before to correct the error whereas
if we find an error here we can correct
it right away and we don't affect the
subsequent phases so how can we collect
the right requirements traditional
requirements engineering does so through
a set of steps the first step is
elicitation which is the collection of
requirements from stakeholders and other
sources and can be done in a variety of
ways and we will discuss some of them
the second is requirement analysis which
involves a study and a deeper
understanding of the collected
requirements the third step is the
specification of requirements in which
the collected requirements are suitably
represented organized and saved so that
they can be shared also in this case
there are many ways to do this and we
will see some of these ways when we talk
about the requirements engineering in a
dedicated lesson once the requirements
have been specified they can be
validated to make sure that they're
complete consistent non redundant and so
on so that they satisfy a set of
important properties for requirements
finally the fifth step is requirement
management which accounts for changes to
requirements during the lifetime of the
project and here I talked about steps
kind of giving the impression that we
are just going from the first step to
the fifth one and that this is sort of a
linear process in reality as we will see
this is more of an iterative process in
which we'll go and we cover the
different phases in an iterative fashion
we will discuss extensively requirements
engineering
