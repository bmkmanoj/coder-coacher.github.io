condition and invariant can be a hard
task under tools that help us doing that
this is the idea of inferring invariance
having a tool that automatically
provides data invariants preconditions
and postconditions I'm going to show you
how such tools work and we're going to
explore how to build one the daikon tool
by Michael Ernst and colleagues is a
tool that dynamically detects invariants
from programmer the idea is that you do
have a set of executions here's one
execution here's another one and here's
five execution what daikon does is it
analyzes these runs and checks whether
there are any properties of variables
that hold for all observed runs for
instance it could determine that the
variable X is odd whenever the function
f is being called how does that can do
that first thing it does it gets traces
a trace is a listing of all functions
that were called and all values of all
variables very much like the sister set
trace function in Python which we have
used to trace through programs what
daikon has built in is a so called
pattern library a pattern library of
possible invariants here's such a
pattern Dola one equals zero here is
such a pattern we have a placeholder
which equals zero daikon now takes the
Train looks at all the variables and
checks which variable satisfies this
pattern that is it replaces the place
holder with every single variable found
in the trace so it checks whether x
equals zero whether y equals zero
whether Z equals zero and so on and only
those patterns that match are being
retained those that don't match are
eliminated x and y are not zero and
they're eliminated this one is retained
daikon checks these patterns for every
single invocation of a function and only
retains those that hold for all
invocations of the function which means
that over time the set of instantiated
patterns becomes smaller and smaller
it's like a sieve at the end if this in
sensation is found to hold for all
invocations of a function
then it's actually retained and finally
reported as an invariant daikon has
hundreds of these patterns and it tries
them all out one by one on all variables
at all invocation yes this takes a bit
of time so if by applying the pattern
library daikon has found out that X is
always odd when F is being called it
reports this as an invariant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
