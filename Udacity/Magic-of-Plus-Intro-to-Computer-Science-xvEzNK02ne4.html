in Python is there's nothing really
special about it it's just a short way
of calling a magic method what that
means is when you have an expression a
plus B what's really going on here is
that you're calling a function and it's
the function that you get by looking at
the type of a for the attribute
underscore underscore add underscore
underscore which is a function that
takes two inputs and a and B are those
inputs so the only thing that's magic
about plus is that there's a special
syntax that makes it easier to use when
you start defining your own types which
we'll get to pretty soon well you can
define a plus operator for your own
types so what that means is that you can
actually make plus work for your own
types by defining an ADD method and
we're getting a little ahead of
ourselves so we'll get to that later but
that's something to look forward to that
you'll be able to define your own types
and give plus whatever meaning you want
for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
