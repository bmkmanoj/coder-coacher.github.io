quick things earlier on we were talking
you made it kind of often comment about
or maybe I made a Norfolk comment about
the fact that because we're doing this
little prisoner's dilemma thing and we
have this sort of wall here we're going
to end up in this little bad place right
with the minus six minus six and there
was this kind of notion that what if we
could hear each other would that make a
difference and the answer was no not
really because whoever goes first is
going to lose and if you try to get
people to go at the same time well in
some sense that's the same thing as
having a wall and you can't hear each
other if you have to go at exactly the
same time right does that make sense I
didn't quite understand why does the
person who goes first lose because if I
can find out whether you're going to
cooperate or defect then I will just
then do the thing that makes sense so if
you do anything but the fact I will
defect and then I win and you will lose
whoever goes first runs the risk of the
other person screwing them over so
unless that person defects right but if
that person defects the other person is
going to defect right so but you don't
lose any more than you would have that's
true and but you still end up in this
kind of unfortunate place so one course
you might have there is well yeah but
that's just because you can only do this
once but what if you could do this twice
so let's imagine we're going to be in
this situation today and then we're
gonna be in this situation tomorrow
because you know you keep leading me
astray so whatever happens today I can
use this information for what I might do
tomorrow so if I decide to go ahead and
cooperate this time and you defect and I
know you're the kind of person who
defects and so when we're in this
situation again I am definitely going to
defect so maybe in that situation it's
in your best interest to go ahead and
cooperate because then we can keep
cooperating together and in the end it
sort of works out so maybe this notion
of not just playing prisoner's dilemma
once but playing prisoner's dilemma
twice or three times or four times or
five times
might come to a different result yeah
that seems plausible I mean I can
imagine saying to you through this
channel in the wall something that says
you know cooperate with me or yeah right
or I will I will stop cooperating with
you and so you get more reward if you if
you cooperate with me right so my
question to you is what does happen
exactly
in this set where I have two versions to
the consecutive games of prisoner's
dilemma to play what am I gonna do okay
well now I mean like we can turn this
into a game right and this that's what
you were teaching us how to do yes so
now the game has four well I don't know
I mean so one way to do it is to say a
has a choice to make on the first step
and and that could be cooperate or
defect and then the second step could be
cooperated effect so there's four
possibilities Roby has the same four
possibilities but maybe we can actually
have a be responsive to B so a has two
things to do on the first step and then
two things to do on the second step for
each thing that B did on the first step
for a total of eight combinations well
we may be the 8 by 8 matrix we should be
able to solve it right so that's pretty
easy to do you just kind of draw an 8 by
8 matrix in you know that many
dimensions and it you don't you end up
right here what's it thinking about that
many dimensions I just thought like the
normal kind of matrix but okay oh my 8
so that's kind of a pain right so 64
cells and I guess I guess we don't want
to fill that out yeah but you know what
we could fill that out but I'm gonna
help you out here by pointing out you
know what it's not gonna make a
difference
oh so here let's see if I can walk you
through why it's not going to make a
difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
