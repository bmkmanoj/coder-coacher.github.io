quick things earlier on we were talking
you made it kind of often comment about
or maybe I made an off a comment about
the fact that because we're doing this
little prisoner's dilemma thing we have
this sort of wall here we're going to
end up in this little bad place right
with the minus six minus six and there
was this kind of notion that what if we
could hear each other would that make a
difference and the answer was no not
really because whoever goes first is
going to lose and if you try to get
people to go at the same time well in
some sense that's the same thing as
having a wall and you can't hear each
other if you have to go at exactly the
same time right does that make sense I
didn't quite understand why does the
person who goes first lose because if I
find out whether you're going to
cooperate or defect then i will just
then do the thing that makes sense so if
you do anything but the fact i will
defect and then i win then you will lose
so ever goes first runs the risk of the
other person screwing them over so i see
it looks unless that person to facts
right but if that person defects the
other person is going to defect right so
but you don't lose any more than you
would have that's true and but you still
end up in this kind of unfortunate place
so one course you might have there is
well yeah but that's just because you
can only do this once but what if you
could do this twice so let's imagine
we're going to be in this situation
today and then we're going to be in this
situation tomorrow because you know you
keep leading me astray so whatever
happens today I can use this information
for what I might do tomorrow so if I
decide to go ahead and cooperate this
time and you defect and I know you're
the kind of person who defects and so
when we're in this situation again I am
definitely going to defect so maybe in
that situation it's in your best
interest to go ahead and cooperate
because then we can keep cooperating
together and in the end it sort of works
out so maybe this notion of not just
playing prisoner's dilemma once but
playing prisoners delimits twice or
three times or four times or five times
might come to a different result yeah
that seems plausible i mean i can
imagine saying to you through this
channel in the wall something that says
you know cooperate with me or yeah right
or i will i will stop cooperating with
you and so you get more reward if you if
you cooperate with me right so my
question to you is what does happen
exactly
in this set where I have two versions to
two consecutive games of prisoner's
dilemma to play what am I going to do
okay well now I mean like we can turn
this into a game right and this that's
what you were teaching us how to do you
so now the game has four well i don't
know i mean so one way to do it is to
say a has a choice to make on the first
step and and that could be cooperated
effect and then the second step could be
cooperated effect so there's four
possibilities ruby has the same four
possibilities but maybe we can actually
have a be responsive to be so a has two
things to do on the first step and then
two things to do on the second step for
each thing that be did on the first step
for a total of eight combinations right
we may be the 8 by 8 matrix we should be
able to solve it right so that's pretty
easy to do you just kind of draw an 8 by
8 matrix in you know that many
dimensions and it you don't you end up
right here what's it thinking about that
many dimensions I just thought like the
normal kind of matrix but okay oh i see
is it I mean I ate so that's kind of a
pain right so 64 cells and I guess I
guess we don't want to fill that out
yeah but you know what we could fill
that out but I'm going to help you out
here by pointing out you know what it's
not gonna make a difference oh so here
let's see if I can walk you through why
it's not going to make a difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
