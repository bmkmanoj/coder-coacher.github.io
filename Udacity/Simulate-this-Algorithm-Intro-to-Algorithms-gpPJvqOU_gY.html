carelessly you might say that the first
number that goes into E is the length of
the shortest hop path from A to E which
in this case would be well there's two
ways to get with distance 11 two here
and two hops and then another seven so
you might have said 18 but in fact it
won't expand d into e until it knows the
shortest distance to D and the shortest
distance is going to be 10 because we
can go this way for plus 1 is 5 and 5 is
10 so it should be 17 but let's actually
simulate it and see what happens so we
expand out a into C and B and once we've
done that the shortest non completed
distance is the one to see so we're
going to lock that down and then we
expand from that node see there's two
edges to incomplete nodes C to D and C
to be the C to B has a length of 1 plus
the length of four we already had so
that actually improves this one to five
and a new node joins the picture D and C
to D is seven on top of the four we
already had for a total of eleven all
right of the non completed nodes be
indeed the one with the smallest
distance is be with distance of five we
can lock that down and look at the
outgoing edges from B which is just this
one that goes to D which has a length of
five plus the five we already had for a
length of 11 and B which improves our d
which improves d 10 and is the only node
that we can read to this point that we
haven't completed yet so we can lock it
down expand out its neighbors which are
f and e f gets 20 and e gets a 17 and
not only is that the first number
written in E but it is the final one
because the very next thing we lock down
is ease distance we don't lock down f's
distance until we actually discover that
there's a shorter path a 19th path 19
link path alright so I think you
understand this well enough that we can
try to code it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
