conduction of heat along the wire now
we're in a position to put some
mathematical meaning to it as time goes
on the value of the temperature changes
by the length of the time step times
this expression so this expression has
to be the rate of change of the
temperature with respect to time T dot
eight if you will each time zero of
course we're always dealing with
estimates here even though I'm writing
an equal sign but now let me know about
central difference formulas we have
another interpretation of that term it's
one millimeter squared Delta x squared
times the second derivative of our
temperature of course I'm again cheating
a little here we only know the
temperatures of the different
compartments don't have any curve of
which we could form the second
derivative now we are going to write
this equation in a professional fashion
let's do this right temperature depends
both on space and time it changes along
the via that is both position and it
changes with time we see temporal
evolution what we need here is the rate
of change with respect to time and the
way to be writing this is this it's
called the partial derivative of the
temperature with respect to time it's
not written with the lower case letting
d but with this curly type of D this
derivative of the temperature with
respect to time equals 10 / one second x
1 millimeter squared and this one is the
second partial derivative of temperature
with respect to position written like
this note how this is being written the
curly d is squared not the complete
expression in the numerator even though
in the denominator everything is being
squared we're going to discuss partial
derivatives in the next segments so bear
with me this equation is called the heat
equation in this case it describes the
conduction of heat along a wire along
one dimension and it's a partial
differential equation pde is the
technical term it contains partial
derivatives that is why the differential
equations we have seen so far are
ordinary differential equations Oh des
pdes partial differential equations are
typical for problems in space or
problems in space and time the constant
involved here is often called a
alpha the thermal diffusivity the name
already hints at this being a diffusion
equation the heat diffuses along the
wire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
