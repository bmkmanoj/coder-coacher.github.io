when you find yourself in this situation
where you need to get creative you're
probably going to need to scrape data
from a website in my experience this is
most often the case when the data is
provided by a government agency of some
kind or maybe a small grassroots
organization in this case the example
I'd like to look at is from the US
Bureau of Transportation Statistics so
imagine we have a need for among other
things to get statistics on how many
flights individual carriers have to and
from the airports in the United States
okay now this particular page provides
us with a way of getting at that type of
flight data that is how many flights say
Virgin Atlantic has into and out of
boston logan airport but in order to get
it we have to go through a lot of work
and a lot of manual effort if we want to
pull all the data for all the carriers
so this is a great example of a
situation where we would
programmatically deal with this problem
okay now I've got the zoomed in big
enough so that we can see what's on the
page and as a result of layout is
falling apart a little bit so bear with
that so let's take a look at how we
would use this site now right now this
is providing for us the number of
domestic and international flights for
all carriers usn foreign with a
destination of any airport so if I want
to get just the data for Virgin America
and all of the flights for virgin into
logan airport in boston i can make those
selections and click Submit and here we
have just that data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
