paragraphs here's the first one they're
all so different bullying talking about
the shape of my foot he noticed once
even before he was introduced when I was
in the DBC with Paul D laughing and
trying to listen I was waggling my foot
we both ordered to tease and plain bread
and butter and I saw him looking with
his two old maids of sisters when I
stood up and asked the girl where it was
what do I care with it dropping out of
me and that black clothes breeches he
made me buy takes you half an hour to
let down wedding all myself always with
some brand new fad every other week
here's the second one this creation in
which we live began with the dominant
nature as an identification body with a
completed evolutionary strong material
creation in a major body resistance
force and is fulfilling the nature
identification in a like weaker material
identification creation in which two
major bodies have already fulfilled
radio body balances and embodying a
third material identification embodiment
of both so what do you think about these
two paragraphs is either one creative or
both or neither check whichever one you
fill is creative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
