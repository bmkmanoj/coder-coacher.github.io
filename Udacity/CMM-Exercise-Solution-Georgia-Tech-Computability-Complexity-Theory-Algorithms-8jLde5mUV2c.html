diagonal the first one is easy since
it's just the cost of the pairwise
product next we'll consider this entry
here corresponding to the product of ABC
first consider breaking it up as a times
bc that would be zero for computing a
plus 9 for computing c plus 6 times 3
times 3 for computing the product for a
total of sixty-three the other partition
a B times C has cost 18 for a b 04 c + 6
times 1 times 3 4 combining the products
for a total of thirty-six that ends up
as the smaller of the two possibilities
so we'll go ahead and write that
information in the table here now we
move on to the the other entry along
this diagonal the one for the product
BCD will consider first computing this
as B times C D that costs 04 be 24 for
CD and for computing the product 3 times
1 times 8 for a total of forty-eight the
other partition bc times d has cost nine
for bc 04 just grabbing d + 3 x 3 x 8
for the product for a total of eighty to
48 is the minimum cost and the better
partition is B times the quantity CD so
we'll record that information in the
table now for the last entry consider
first the partition a time's the
quantity b c d the cost of a by itself
is 0 the cost of BCD was 48 and the cost
of the product was 6 times 3 times 8 for
a total of 192 the products a B times C
D costs 18 for a b-24 for CD and 6 times
1 times 8 for combining these products
for a total of ninety lastly we have
this partition
the quantity ABC times d ABC cost 36 d
by itself cost zero and the products
cost six times 3 times 8 for a total of
180 the middle one here is clearly the
best so we record that fact and that
gives us that partition which we can
write in these squares like so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
