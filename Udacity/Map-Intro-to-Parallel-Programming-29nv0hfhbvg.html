just did we have two ingredients here
that are going to lead to an interesting
and crucial abstraction called map first
we have a set of elements that we'd like
to process in our example this set is an
array of 64 floats second we have the
ability to write an arbitrary function
that runs on one element in our example
our function squared each of its input
elements producing an output element
generically what we did was apply our
function to each element in the set this
is a powerful parallel operation so to
be precise when we talk about this we
say that we have a traction named map it
takes two arguments a set of elements
and a function that will be applied to
each of those elements map is a key
building block of GPU computing many of
the problems you will solve as a GPU
programmer and certainly many of the
ones in this class use map operations
GPUs are good at map for two main
reasons
one GPUs have many parallel processors
the GPU is efficient at delegating the
computation of individual elements to
those processors we're going to find out
more about that soon second GPUs
optimized for throughput rather than
latency so as a programmer you're
probably more interested in optimizing
the rate at which entire map operations
can complete instead of the time it
takes for any individual element to
complete and the GPU agrees with you
let's also take a look at the
communication pattern for a map
operation Maps model is straightforward
one element in one element out with the
computation of output element number n
only dependent on input element number n
this is a very simple and
straightforward communication pattern
other computations might require a more
complex communication pattern and we'll
learn about those patterns over the next
few units so to make sure we understand
map let's do a little quiz check the
problems that can be solved using a map
operation on an input array
sort add one to each element in the
array sum of all the elements in the
array or compute the average of the
elements in the input array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
