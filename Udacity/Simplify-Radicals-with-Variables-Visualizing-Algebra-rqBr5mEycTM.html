found even one of those for the first
one we want to list all the factors of
our radicand we know 2 times 2 times 3
equals 12 and then we have three X's
multiplied together and two y's
multiplied together we're taking a
square root and the index is a two here
so we want to find factors that repeat
twice we have two twos two x's and two
y's so we can pull one two out one x out
and one y out this three and this X are
factors that need to stay underneath the
square root symbol and it's because
they're not paired this leaves us with
our final answer 2xy times the square
root of 3x for the second one we want to
find factors that repeat three times
since our index is a three we have three
threes and three C's so we can pull out
one three and 1c from a radical these
factors don't appear in a triple so we
have to leave them inside of the cube
root well I've 2a squared times C and
our cube root this gives us our final
result keep in mind that this 3 is the
index on the group it's not the exponent
of the C so be careful when you're
writing your expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
