two attendees I see music and Johnny
concert yeah I get it we want to add
this like column or this field on to our
attendee object I want to just add a
field but I feel like something special
has to happen to get it to talk to you
know I know about festival sir well
that's what's so great about creating
relationships in Salesforce it's just as
easy as everything else we've already
been doing so you can go to the object
setup and just create a new field you
feel yeah okay is this where the magic
comes in and choosing the field type
right and there's two types of
relationship fields in Salesforce look
up a master detail we can go into more
detail about that later but why don't we
choose master detail just for now okay
you will tell me later I will I promise
so master detail relationship
relationship makes sense I like that and
next ah okay so I'm guessing yeah I'm
gonna relate this to festival okay um so
what's all this about so again this is
just gonna create the label for this
field that'll be on the record detail
page this is like our column name over
here just like the column name exactly
and so festival is good okay Auto did
that that was nice so description the
name of the festival the attendee is
going to write okay what's this one all
about child relationship name so again
that's just a unique API name that's
gonna live in the database it's more for
the code side of things or if we were
trying to build something off of child
records and then should I just leave
everything else leave everything else is
default I will add the fields of the
page layout so it's gonna automatically
add it to the page layout because it's a
required field so what's going on with
this add custom related lists so what
this is gonna do is it's gonna add a
list of attendees to the record or the
festival record just like how on
attendees you can see which festival
they're going to go to when you go to
the festival record you'll see a list of
all of the attendees that are going to
this festival cool
making it safe uh-oh it's getting mad at
me so it's throwing this air because
with master-detail when you create this
relationship it becomes a required field
and since there are already too hard
field means like the attending needs to
have a festival exactly and since there
are already two attendees that were
created and they aren't related to a
festival you can't create this
relationship so it's like protecting us
from having all these attendees that
don't make sense anymore yes okay and so
the way to get around this is let's
create a lookup relationship first
because in that case it won't be a
required field and then we can add them
and then change it exactly okay so let's
go through that one more time but choose
lookup relationship this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
