process related mistakes and also in
this case this kind of mistakes can be
due to many reasons and are of many
types one typical example are scheduling
issues which are due to the fact of
being unable to come up with a realistic
schedule so to have an overly optimistic
schedule and this can be because we
underestimate the effort involved in
different parts of the project because
we overestimate the ability of the
people involved because we overestimate
the importance for example of the use of
tools but no matter what the reason is
the result is typically that the
projects end up being late which is a
very common situation so this is somehow
related to planning and in general
planning is a fundamental factor in
software processes and in software
development mistakes in planning such as
insufficient planning or abandoning
planning due to pressure usually lead
inexorably to failure and speaking of
failures often there are unforeseen
failures such as failures on the
contractors end for example that might
lead to low quality or late deliverables
which ultimately affects the downstream
activities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
