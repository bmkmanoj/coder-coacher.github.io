are three receptors that are absorbing
light results in what's referred to as
the Tri stimulus color theory the idea
is that it's three inputs and you know
here it says the spectral response of
each of the three types of cones unlike
the previous one where we're showing you
the relative sensitivity of each of them
what this graph is showing you just as
it says this is the percentage of light
absorbed by each cone actually by each
cone type the reason that even though
blue is so much more sensitive down here
because there are so few blue cones the
amount of light down here absorbed by
the blue cones compared to the amount
absorbed by red cones and green cones is
approximately equal because there's so
many more green cones and red cones than
there are blue cones this or the
question then is is can we how it's just
kin but how would we use the outputs of
these three types of receptors in order
to see color in a particularly like
spectral color and what I mean by
spectral colors you're all familiar with
this red orange yellow green blue indigo
violet you probably learn that somewhere
along the way is the colors in the
rainbow well what it really is is these
are different wavelengths of light
and those are the colors that you see
when those wavelengths are put out okay
and I'll we'll see a little bit more
about what we mean by that all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
