time trying to get an intuition of what
this M matrix is so the best way to
think about what an image moment is an
image moment is a particularly weighted
average of image pixel intensities and
it could also be a function of those
intensities and it's using to basically
give our certain specific property at a
point within an image so at any image
shown by this rectangle here at any
point I want to be able to kind of find
some properties that are kind of
descriptive and something I can actually
find about that image and of course what
we will leverage here is information
driven by the derivatives at that point
so if the derivatives of course can be
measured using various types of things
we've looked at and from that I can find
a gradient vector the magnitude of that
and the direction the second moment
matrix is specifically a matrix derived
from the gradient of this function that
could be actually at this point and it
summarizes the predominant directions of
the gradient in a specified neighborhood
of that point so around that point it
basically now gives you more information
about the direction and the magnitude
one additional thing that's important
about at the moment second moment matrix
it also gives you a little bit more
information about the coherency of the
directions in that neighborhood so let's
look at the equation of how we would
compute the second moment matrix
basically again it is the intensities in
X are sorry the derivative of the
intensities in x and y direction and
then the mixtures of these X and Y's on
the diagonals are off diagonals and
compute it over any neighborhood point
on the course the neighborhood search is
this region here so again simply put if
I had an image like this basically I can
use the second moment matrix to at any
point and the neighborhood around that
point find description using the
gradients that is unique to this point
and actually I want to use this to
understand more about what's happening
in the region and that could be used to
now compute the information about if
there's a corner and what kinds of
parameters associated with that corner
in that image thing to note of course is
and we've talked about this is the
importance of the ellipse and the
eigenvalues again something we've looked
at before
of course when you have certain bits of
information and again if you think about
it this way with the moments it's kind
of giving information what's the best
possible rotation around these two
different axes and of course we use this
to define two major axes or sorry one
for this ellipse a minor the C and the
major axes and this kind of gives us
what's the most dominant direction for
this region and that's what we're
interested in here is at any point in an
image finding these types of ellipsoids
and using these ellipsoids to find the
dominant directions and of course recall
that eigenvalues provide us with this
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
