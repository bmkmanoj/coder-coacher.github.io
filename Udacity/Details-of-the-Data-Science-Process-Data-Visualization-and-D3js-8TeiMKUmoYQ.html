often think of as the first part of this
process acquiring and munging data and
often this is what takes the most time
on the right been places interactive
data visualization which is typically
what people think of as the final
product a pretty chart or graphic once
all the hard work has been done been
places the domain
he thinks most naturally fits above each
stage the first of which being computer
science in the larger context of data
visualization or data science as a whole
the acquire and parsing stages are often
concerned with data ingestion via web
scraping log collection database
accesses etc and building scalable
extract transform and load pipelines or
ETL the second group here of filtering
and mining represents what is often most
associated with data science and many
people consider the most exciting this
includes modeling data mining and
exploratory analysis an applying
statistical and mathematical theory to
discover insights because of this Ben
Frey labels the second stage as
associated with statistics and data
mining well people often think the
second stage is so to say where the
magic happens and the models are built I
really want to stress the importance of
the process as a whole after all if you
didn't have any data in a readily
accessible form you couldn't model it
and even once you have a model if you
can't present and communicate your
results they might as well never have
happened
the third stage here focuses on the
visual representation of your data and
how you present it graphically thus is
most associated with the fields of
graphic design and visualization theory
it is in this third stage that we
experiment with different visual
encodings to present our data in the
most effective manner and the fourth
stage here is concerned with how a
reader or your
audience might interact with your
visualization techniques from the field
of information visualization and
human-computer interaction apply here to
determine how best to design your
graphic or visualization such that
enables your user to potentially
discover insights for themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
