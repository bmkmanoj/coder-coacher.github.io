in 60 dad's end up raising a child that
doesn't belong to him so non paternity
is obviously an issue at fairly high
prevalence in the United States and
general possibly the world in general
how does 23 me deal with issues of non
paternity well I've heard estimates
similar to that and a big range of
estimates from two percent to ten
percent of kids are not aware of who
their biological fathers so this is
certainly a big issue for 23 me because
it's one of the most high impact results
that someone who signs up from 24 23 me
can get and before people sign up it's
very important that they consider the
possibility of making a discovery about
biological relationships in their family
that they didn't previously know about
and so and that's why when we launched
the service from the very beginning we
in our Terms of Service we said be you
should be aware that you may learn
things about yourself that you find
uncomfortable that are disturbing
including that your biological father is
not your biological further the person
you know to be your father is not your
biological father so we were very
explicit from the very beginning that
this is the possibility and so that the
people are aware that that is something
that can come out of DNA analyses and so
our people do you find many people not
aware that the personal genetic services
offered at 23 I mean is essentially in a
way can be like a paternity test well
many organizations that do official
paternity testing are doing it in a way
that it the evidence will hold up in a
court so it's a bit a day of a different
process so for 23 Emmy customers it's
more like something they just discover
but when they're exploring their data in
the main way that people discover normal
tourney is if they find that their
genetic relationship to another family
never it's not what they had anticipated
that
that they are instead of being a full
sibling with someone I think there's
their sibling there a half-sibling
because they have different fathers so
that's not an unusual and one a resource
that we provide is we provide a forearm
a discussion forum where many of our
customers put out their questions to
other members of the 23 me community and
that's where we've seen evidence of
people discovering opportunity and very
often they have questions like how do i
check without what to find out whether
this is the two or not how do I handle
conversations with other members of my
family and other members of the 21-day
community often come forward with advice
on you know who else should be tested in
the family how do you know approach um
yeah other family members and I've seen
people reporting cases where they said
I'm not going to tell my dad that I've
discovered this because he's been my dad
all my life and um and there's no need
for us to change that sure I'm not
imagine and so people make these big
personal decisions once they get this
this information no is there any way for
23 me to actually track this discovery
rate or is it just sort of an organic so
we do not do any formal tracking it's
really if someone comes forward with a
story and sit and tells us and set and
tells us that they've made this
discovery that's the only way we
actually find it out so it does happen
we have seen people coming forward with
stories about discovering that their
father is not their genetic father um
but it sort of the two sides of the coin
we've also had cases where people
discovered their father's not the
genetic father but then they've actually
gone on to discover their biological
father so it becomes sort of a story of
discovery not just right al awesome
that's right they've actually found the
biological relatives through DNA as well
and
so it's all part of the big picture that
you know DNA is all about families and
you can discover that relationships
aren't as you think they are and you can
find new relationships that you didn't
want aware up for four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
