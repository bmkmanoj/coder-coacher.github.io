today my friend Hezekiah is working on a
project where he's going to be using NBC
and he's never used NBC before or any
design pattern before so I was wondering
if you could maybe share what your
thoughts are on what a design pattern is
and why would anyone want to use one
absolutely so a design pattern is
basically a general way or strategy to
solve common software problems and
they're prescriptive in nature they
recommend kind of like best practices
common patterns to solve common software
problems could you tell us about a time
where you were maybe working with some
messy legacy code or maybe it was your
own code and you had to use a design
pattern like MVC to help clean it up
absolutely so if design patterns kind of
codify the best practices and these
templates to you know solve these
problems it's evil twin is it the anti
pattern or different kinds of energy
patterns and one of the most common ones
that deal with pretty much on a daily or
weekly basis is the quote unquote God
object and that's where you have this
very large class in object orientation
of single responsibility principle so
under the context of MVC this this god
object could touch the model so it could
be touching the database in certain
layers it could be touching the view so
it could be messing around with a
template and it can also be making these
transactions with the controller so it's
it's has its hands in different buckets
and it's not responsible for just one
thing I deal with that on a daily basis
sometimes this code that I wrote
sometimes it's code that other people
wrote and one of the challenges there of
dealing with a god object is that
because it touches so many different
things it has all these coupled
dependencies so if something breaks in
one location it'll break everywhere so
when we refactor these god objects what
we try to do is to really adhere to
single responsibility principle so if
it's a class that should only exist on
the model layer or the only bridge
posture for business logic we try to
abstract away all the other
responsibilities to other objects I
think sandy Mets
she made a very excellent example or
kind of analogy where she recommended
that your classes you want them to be
these tiny isolated islands with small
bridges or a limited number of bridges
connecting them so that you have you
know one or two classes that do one or
two things very very well and they have
very super simple api's and they talk to
other classes through their simple API
as well and at the end once you factor
God objects into good object-oriented
design you have a very clean stable API
that anyone can really jump on to and
it's clean you know where everything is
it's very simple you know that this
class only does you know two or three
things and you're good to go nice do you
feel that using separation of concerns
or using design patterns in MVC has
changed how you work collaboratively and
a team at all yeah absolutely so if you
have if you have single responsibility
principle and you know separation
concerns and one of your co-workers
writes a class that you know take for
example is responsible for some type of
presentation logic so maybe it's like a
component like a banner or something on
the front end you can reuse that
anywhere else because you know that it's
well tested and it only does that one
thing and one thing very well great
great thank you for coming to speak with
us today yeah absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
