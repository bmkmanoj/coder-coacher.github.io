far to solve quadratic equations we
first started by reviewing factoring
then we looked at the root method and
finally we completed the square factor
means perhaps the easiest method if we
can factor a quadratic equation if we
can't factor it then we'll want to use
one of these two approaches in order to
get our solutions and if none of these
three methods were work we have one last
method that will always work that method
is the quadratic formula there are some
advantages and disadvantages to this
method let's see what they are for any
equation written in this form we can
find the solutions to it by doing
negative b plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac all divided by 2a
this is our quadratic formula and it
only requires that we know the values of
a B and C a is the coefficient of the x
squared term B is the coefficient of the
x term and C would be the constant term
I mentioned the pros and cons for this
quadratic formula well the pro is that
it can solve any quadratic equation so
long as we have the a B and C and the
left-hand side is set equal to zero we
could also have the equation reverse the
left-hand side could be 0 and the
right-hand side could be this for the
cons it's actually very easy to make a
sign error in two places here we need to
take the negative value of B so if to
change the sign the other place that we
might make a sign error is underneath
the radical B squared should always end
up being a positive number and then we
have minus 4ac now depending on the
values of a and C the second term might
end up being positive or it might stay
negative you'll want to pay close
attention to how many negative signs you
have here to determine this number and
finally another drawback to the
quadratic formula is that we have to
simplify will need to simplify this
radical and then we'll also need to
simplify this fraction if we can
sometimes this result will end up being
integers and sometimes it will end up
being fractions keep in mind that we
could get imaginary solutions if we have
a negative radical here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
