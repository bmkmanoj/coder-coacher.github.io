cryptography and the reason for that is
they all involve secrets let's go
through each and turn so the first is
opening a door with a mechanical key
what's the secret there well let's look
at a key so the secret is actually the
shape of the key now that I've shown you
this key there's no secret anymore if
you can look at the ridges on the key
well you know the secret you can make a
copy of the key and open whatever door
this opens hopefully it's not something
very important since I've just shown the
key in a public video and it's actually
possible to do this from a fairly large
distance there was a group of students
at University of California San Diego
that showed that from taking a picture
several hundred feet away you could
learn enough about a key to create a
replica that would open the same door
playing poker certainly involves secrets
it wouldn't be much of a game if
everyone would see everyone else's cards
logging into your audacity Udacity
account involves entering an email and
password and I'm not going to actually
type my password now because one of the
things I hope you'll start to understand
from this classes even if you don't see
it because of the stars here the fact
that you can hear the audio of my
keyboard would give you a pretty big
clue about what my password is and the
number of characters and unlike the key
that I showed you this protects
something really important so I'm not
going to expose my password we will talk
in one of the future units about how to
manage passwords correctly this involves
a lot of encryption your password of the
secret but you also want to manage
passwords and check them in a way that
doesn't require storing those secrets
you don't want to store passwords in a
way that could expose them easily and
we'll talk about that more in unit 2 the
final option doing a search using Google
comm is an interesting one this actually
changed about a year ago whether or not
that involves encryption and if you try
it today you'll note when you enter
google.com what happens is you actually
get redirected to http google.com and
you can see the lock in the browser
this means it's using a protocol called
TLS to encrypt all the traffic between
you and Google so both the key words
that you're typing
are not exposed on the Internet as well
as the search results and we'll talk
more about that in a later unit in a
class that involves both asymmetric and
symmetric encryption there's lots of
interesting things about the protocol to
protect web traffic that we'll talk
about later in the class so the key
point is that secrets are all around us
that they're very useful for solving
problems you're using cryptology all the
time every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
