write accesses all throughout the
program towards a single location is
rather uncommon there are languages
however where any function that executes
can access any part of the memory on
purpose and sometimes by accident this
particular true for languages in which
memory is under control by the
programmer languages such as C and C++
to illustrate wine languages such as C
and C++ memory management can be a huge
problem let me show you a short piece of
C code that can cause lots and lots of
trouble in C and also C++ you obtain
memory by calling a special function
which is called Mallik for memory
allocator when you work now log you give
us an argument the number of bytes that
you'd like to have for your data
structure strictly speaking it's the
number of characters but let's keep that
the effect of this statement is that you
will be getting a chunk of bytes and you
will get a pointer that points to the
beginning of this allocated memory what
you actually have here is an array of 10
characters you can write this character
one by one for instance in location
number five let's store an X in C as in
other languages every start with an
index of 0 so 5 is actually the sixth
element in the array we can also read
elements from the array for instance we
can access the tenth element of the
array and store the resulting character
in why the only problem is there is no
10th character the array has only 10
elements and this would be the eleventh
eleventh element the behavior of a sea
program at this moment becomes undefined
that isn't anything can happen it is
possible that some completely random
value is stored in why this is actually
the most likely outcome it is also
possible that the program immediately
stops it is also possible that your
program all of a sudden transforms into
an adventure game and allows you to
explore the colossal caves that's a very
unlikely outcome but keep in mind that
in one release of the glue compiler
the new programmers had some fun and
stating well in undefined behavior
anything can happen so let's simply go
and make this again this was not very
appreciated by the programmers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
