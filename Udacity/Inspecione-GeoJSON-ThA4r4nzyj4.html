especially once we load it in with d3
just as with the previous charts we
simply set up our margins are within our
hive and we append an SVG element this
time with class map to our page and now
we can put in a debugger so we can pause
execution and inspect what geo data
looks like and the structure it has as
you can see here we've loaded our globe
HTML file that we were just looking at
in the browser and execution has paused
at line 22 in the debugger looking at
what geo data is we can see here that is
a JavaScript object with top-level keys
type with value feature collection and
features the corresponds to an array and
again another one of the benefits of
using geo JSON is that it's simply a
JSON file that we can pass around like
any other in this case we can even load
it in with d3 standard JSON data loading
function and when we inspect it in our
console you can see here the chrome web
console treats it like any other JSON
and gives us this nested structure to
inspect through we can see here that in
the features array there's 177 items
each of which itself is an object that
has a geometry key and the properties
key the properties in this case as a
single key value pair that's the name of
the country in this case the first one
is Afghanistan what makes geo JSON
unique is its shape extensions here we
can see each country has a geometry key
the corresponds to an object that both
has coordinates and the type in this
case the geometry of a country is a
polygon as we can see here and
coordinates is an array of values or
rather an array of arrays of two
elements or pairs of coordinates
representing the longitude and latitude
of the country one thing to note here
and it's not explicit is that longitude
actually comes first in this case what's
labeled with zero and latitude comes
second what's labeled as
here and that's just a quirk of the
format and this geometry object that has
coordinate points and the type polygon
represents the border of a country in
this case Afghanistan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
