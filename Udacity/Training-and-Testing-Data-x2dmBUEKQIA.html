eighty eight point four percent correct
for naivebayes
eighty eight point four awesome guys
well does that mean that your
self-driving car only crashed eleven
point six percent of the time it'll
crash occasionally yeah it's not good
enough for cars but it's great for this
course it is very good it's much better
than guessing one of the things that you
did in that example maybe you didn't
even realize you were doing it was you
trained and you tested on two different
sets of data and that's actually really
important in machine learning we always
train and test on different data if you
don't do that what can happen is that
you can over fit to your training data
you can think that you know better
what's going on then then you actually
know that's really important because in
machine learning you have to kind of
generalize to new data that's somewhat
different and I wouldn't we'll just
memorize all the data test it on the
same data as training I would always get
your hand a percent but have no clue how
to generalize to new data that's right
so what you should always do and what
we'll always do in this course is you
should save maybe ten percent of your
data and you use it as your testing set
and that's what you used to actually
tell you how much progress you're making
in terms of learning your patterns and
your data so when you open your report
the results to yourself and to your boss
or the client use the test data result
because it's a much better fair kind of
understanding of how they are doing than
your trainer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
