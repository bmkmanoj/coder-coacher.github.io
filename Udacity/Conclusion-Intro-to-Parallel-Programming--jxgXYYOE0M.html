lessons from this unit if you've made it
this far good for you
there's a lot of material in this unit
advanced material that's pushing the
frontiers of the field but that's why
you took this class right so here's some
of the lessons we learned along the way
dents in body we learned two main
lessons here one is the importance of
minimizing global memory bandwidth and
the second reducing parallelism by
increasing the amount of work per thread
might reduce your overall communication
cost and hence your overall runtime
sparse matrix vector multiply the right
data structure can make a big difference
and the keys to high performance with
our implementation was reducing load and
balance between threads keeping all of
our threads busy and optimizing to use
the most efficient communication
possible breadth-first traversal
choosing the most efficient parallel
algorithm is perhaps the most important
thing you can do for large problems a
superior problem in terms of asymptotic
work complexity will nearly always be
even an optimized more expensive
algorithm and the real challenge in our
optimized algorithm was handling the
irregular expansion and compaction at
each step scan is the natural primitive
to handle these operations list ranking
this is a good example of a problem that
is not inherently parallel to solve it
well on a GPU we use the important
technique of trading more work for fewer
steps and once again we see the power of
scan to address a problem that at first
glance seems difficult to paralyze and
the hash table the key insight and the
hash table implementation was
recognizing that a serial data structure
was the wrong fit for this problem
instead we used cuckoo hashing which was
much more parallel friendly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
