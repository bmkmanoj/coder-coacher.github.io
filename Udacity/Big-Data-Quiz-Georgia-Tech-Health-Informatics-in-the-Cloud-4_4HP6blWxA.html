in exponential rates people have even
coined the term Big Data to refer to
this phenomenon but can't quite agree on
what that means
what separates big data from what I
guess you could call everything else
little data Caesar Hidalgo at MIT Media
Lab says that to qualify for this
distinction data must be big in size
resolution and scope to reframe this
idea in a way that is directly relevant
to transforming healthcare delivery
systems data must represent many
patients and providers must do so in
great detail and must be combined with
other data to give the context within
which that care is delivered and the
external rules and policies within which
that delivery system must operate the
data must in summary be sufficient to
represent the behavior of the complex
adaptive healthcare system we've been
discussing we're in the health IT
landscape might you best go to find big
data as we just defined it for health
care with that being an enterprise EHR
for a major Health System all of the
installations of a specific EMR in a
state or region a service area health
information exchange or none of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
