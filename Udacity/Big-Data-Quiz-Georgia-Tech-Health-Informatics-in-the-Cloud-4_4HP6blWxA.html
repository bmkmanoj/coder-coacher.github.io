in exponential rates people have even
coined the term big data to refer to
this phenomenon but can't quite agree on
what that means what separates big data
from what I guess you could call
everything else little data Cesar
Hidalgo at MIT Media Lab says that to
qualify for this distinction data must
be big in size resolution and scope to
reframe this idea in a way that is
directly relevant to transforming
healthcare delivery systems data must
represent many patients and providers
must do so in great detail and must be
combined with other data to give the
context within which that care is
delivered and the external rules and
policies within which that delivery
system must operate the data must in
summary be sufficient to represent the
behavior of the complex adaptive
healthcare system we've been discussing
where in the health IT landscape might
you best go to find big data as we just
defined it for healthcare would that be
in an enterprise EHR for a major health
system all of the installations of a
specific EMR in a state of region a
service area health information exchange
or none of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
