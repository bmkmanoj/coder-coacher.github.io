with the interview again it's not
important that you get everything right
I think he hit all the things that I
thought were important in the interview
so being able to have knowledge of like
intense and services and those things
were important and maybe sound so we use
every day and all your applications but
at least he has a good knowledge and a
graph of that his solutions I think
sometimes when you ask people these very
open-ended questions they freeze so he
had some creative solutions I think when
I kept kind of probing in like what else
could happen he did a great job there I
would have liked if he followed up with
more questions like I made some
questions very big and he asked some
follow-up questions but I think there
was plenty more to kind of touch on
again it's just important when when you
don't have a very well-structured
problem there is structure but the
interviewer and has that knowledge and
some of the concepts you could tell he's
used in the past like there's some
things about Android that he's used but
he didn't quite understand like maybe
the names or some the concepts so I
think kind of making sure that you can
resolve like this thing that you've done
an Android to the name of it isn't
important as well but overall I think
Sam did a great job and he's a type of
developer wheeler tyre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
