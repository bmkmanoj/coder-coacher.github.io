play on words that Andrew glassner made
up back in the 1980s it succinctly
captures a kernel of truth about
computer graphics the more you can
determine about how light moves through
an environment the better your results
will be I've talked a bit before about
light and how it bounces around a scene
eventually reaching the eye the idea is
that each light often called an emitter
sends photons out the fate of each
photon is that it's absorbed as is or
reflected an object can absorb light and
in fact almost everything absorbs at
least a little light not even the
highest quality mirror reflects one
hundred percent of the light hitting it
the numbers are usually more in the
ninety to ninety-five percent range
along the way photons can be absorbed by
dust water droplets or other particles
in the air or the inside of translucent
objects themselves this simple photon
model ignores various effects such as
polarization in fluorescence but that's
generally fine an interactive computer
graphics things are complex enough we
can see objects precisely because
photons ultimately travel from them to
us the reason objects have different
colors is that each varies in how much
it reflects various wavelengths of light
where we do have some choice in computer
graphics is what light pads we follow
the two pads we've used so far are light
to surface and surface to I we've been a
bit more elaborate with surface to eye
and that we've allowed transparent
filters along this path to modify the
color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
