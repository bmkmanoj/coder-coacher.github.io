it into parts and this question really
is two parts the way I see it first we
have an energy part when I squeeze the
spring i'm adding elastic potential
energy into our system when i let this
go and release it well that elastic
potential energy is being converted to
kinetic energy and so from that i should
be able to find the velocity at which
the mass leaves the table how do i do
that well I say that all of the
potential energy and this is the
potential energy in a spring what all
gets converted to kinetic energy and
solving out the algebra which I've done
in a few steps here tells me that the
velocity with which it leaves the spring
in there for leaves the table is equal
to x times the square root of K over m
plugging in our values well X is 0.25
centimeters remember not meters times
the square root of 350 / 1 but over one
doesn't change anything so square root
of 350 and this gives me a velocity of
four point six eight meters per second
okay phase one of the problem is done
now we can just think of this problem as
a block being thrown horizontally with a
velocity of four point six eight meters
per second and now we use our standard
two-dimensional motion skills to solve
this well first I want to calculate the
time spent in the air since there's no
vertical velocity initially my equation
of motion simplifies to this there's no
v-0 T term this time I know Delta Y is
equal to H so manipulating this around
moving the two up dividing by GI find T
squared is equal to 2 h / g which means
the time the objects bends in the year
it's just the square root of n 2 times H
is 2 meters so two times two is four
over G which is 10 gives me time of 0.6
three seconds and now well I'm almost
done we know that vertical and
horizontal motion are independent in
free fall and we're moving at this
constant velocity of four point six
eight meters per second horizontally
40.6 three seconds so d is just equal to
this v wall called zero X now the
initial velocity in the x-direction
times this time and when i plug in these
numbers i get a distance of two point
nine six or we'll just round it to three
meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
