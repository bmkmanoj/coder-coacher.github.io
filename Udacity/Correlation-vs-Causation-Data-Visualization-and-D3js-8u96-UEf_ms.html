correctly interpreting data stems from
the difference between correlation and
causation if we use some logical
notation borrowed from math a
correlation can simply be stated as both
a and B either go up or down you could
also have an anti correlation where when
a goes up B goes down the difference
with causation is typically one event
happens before the other in this case if
a then B in this case causation is often
a much stronger assumption in effect
than merely a correlation to make this a
little bit more concrete I want to go
through a simple example let's say that
as the number of movies produced in a
year increases the observed incidents of
cancer in a population increases as well
now you might be able to say that as the
number of movies produced increases
people go to the movies more often and
thus exercise less increasing cancer
incidence in the population and while
that may be true an analyst might
conclude a stronger relation between the
number of movies produced and cancer
incidents in a population to be a
causation instead perhaps leading to
some serious actions being taken
erroneously if the relation between
movies produced and cancer is completely
spurious and the true cause of the
cancer incidence increase is due to some
completely separate event if the results
that the analyst found are presented
either on potentially wrong media let's
say an academic paper rather than simply
on their personal blog or maybe in an
article some serious consequences might
be taken based off of again the spurious
correlation let's say the doctor sees a
paper published based on this connection
in relation that some
analyst found and then decides to
recommend to all of his patients to stop
watching all movies in TV because it
increases cancer incidents by
misinterpreting a correlation to in fact
be causation could lead to many
misleading conclusions and thus serious
consequences that others might take
based on those conclusions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
