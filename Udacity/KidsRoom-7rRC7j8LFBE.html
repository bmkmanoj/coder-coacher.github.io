that this does it's very easy to
construct the mhi for one towel from the
other so you can go from Tyler T 2 tau
15 and that's basically a linear scaling
right so I have an action that can go
fast or go slow that's okay it's not
okay for an action that goes the first
half of it is fast and then the second
half is slow we're at to do something
more serious on more serious dynamic
time warping or something like that the
whole idea is that we have these atomic
primitives that can be performed quickly
or slowly but they don't have lots of
parts to them it's very it's recursive
so it's very fast what's interesting is
and I've had conversations with some
people who do work and vision from the
neural side or from computational vision
from biology you could imagine building
something like these mhi detectors from
very simple neural hardware basically
filters with slow responses and the fact
that these can work from very low
resolution images which I haven't shown
but because it's just a global pattern
you don't need a lot of pixels it means
that out here in your peripheral vision
where you have hardly any resolution at
all when we do the human vision lesson
we'll talk about how you think you can
see out here but not really you're just
making it up all right but what it means
it was a very low resolution you can
recognize things so I'm not going to
claim anything in terms of biological
reality I'll just say that there's some
biological plausibility to to this kind
of work and there's a reference in Pammy
which sort of talks more about this we
actually use this system to build a
couple things here's Jim Davis when we
were both much younger building a
aerobics a system where you would be
taken through aerobics by the system and
it would watch you and it would know
which aerobic you're doing I mean which
one you're supposed to be doing it tells
you so it could recognize it was real
easy we did have this cool little thing
that the music and Jim was very clever
making this happen the music was
actually midi control so we can control
the tempo right wasn't just pre recorded
so that means we could watch you and we
could always make the music go just a
little faster than you're going so we
could sort of just play with your head
the speed you up and make you sweat more
but it was cool that the thing we just
recognize uh the system uh a more
compelling use of this technology we
built this thing called the kids room
and it was an interactive play space for
children the original intent was to just
illustrate how computer vision could do
some interesting cool stuff and uh was
interesting is nice article about it in
presence but some folks came by I
remember exactly how it was that they're
at the media lab but um they really
liked it and they ported it to the
Millennium Dome so they built this big
thing called the Millennium Dome in
London at the turn of the century the
millennium and they had all these
pavilions and they were looking for
interesting technologies and this is one
of them that they put in there so I have
a little video here that shows you first
of all temporal templates being used so
the monsters teach the kid these moves
and then which is good because we if we
wanted to we could actually get training
data from the actual kids that were
there but the system was robust enough
that we can use training data from just
a couple of people that we trained on
and would work for everybody we also use
temporal templates plus there's a little
extra stuff that we used it's all in the
paper if you wanted to read about it the
the president's paper and then there was
a little interesting cool thing in
interact well here I'll just get this
started okay so here we have the last
bit where the monsters are teaching the
last two of the moves there only four of
them first he teaches the kids to do a
crouch and then she does her crouched in
response and he's praising how well
she's doing these crouches and that's
great we go to the point where he's
teaching her to do these flapping
motions and you can see he's pleased
with her and he's giving her lots of
good feedback and then I think the last
one he's going to teach her how to do is
how to spin says something like Shirley
loved her to a spin and ready spin dude
there he goes he's spinning and now she
starts spinning and complements her on
that and when the music changes
basically they're supposed to do their
own moves and the monsters will follow
them but it takes him a little while to
catch on and from now on he's following
her now one of the things that we did in
order to make this room look a lot
smarter the monster would say what
you're doing
right and when it would recognize it but
it only did that when it was sure it was
right if it was closed maybe you're
spinning maybe you're flapping it would
just do whichever one it thought was
right but it would only say it if it was
sure and the reason is if a monster goes
and does something that's not what
you're doing the but what do you do you
say oh he wanted to do something else
you just described intentionality to the
character but if he says oh really cool
spin and you're flapping he just looks
stupid so the way you avoid this
interactive system from looking stupid
is it only speaks when it's sure and it
acts all the time because you'll ascribe
intentionality we wrote that up in the
paper it was kind of a cool insight in
terms of how to build interactive
characters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
