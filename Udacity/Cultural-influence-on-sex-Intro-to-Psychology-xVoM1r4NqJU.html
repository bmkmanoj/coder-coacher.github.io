revolves around kind of these sexual
scripts which are those sexual response
cycles that I see couples come in with
and it's almost like they have this
preconditioned idea that this is the
story I'm supposed to have for sex and
if it doesn't go this way then there's
something wrong and so I have to talk
with them about you know what that's
just the story that we have in the
United States mainly from this medical
point of view but you can write your
sexual script any way you want so it
doesn't have to end an orgasm it doesn't
have to start out with this massive
building up of desire and excitement it
can go any way that you want it to and
and that's really what's important as
people need to understand that they
really own their sexual response cycle
and they own their sexual script and it
really can be written and rewritten
anyway that's that's comfortable for
them so we know that there's a
difference in sexual response depending
on the culture but do women and men have
different orgasms even though a lot of
people orgasm whether it be through self
stimulation self love or partnered or
partnered experiences many people do
orgasm however there are large
percentages of people who do not again a
lot of times that does tend to be women
who experience more difficulty orgasming
on average the orgasm kind of experience
is the shortest part of a sexual
response cycle unless of course you're
you know a pig in which case it's like
thirty minutes long but humans are a
very short cycle for their orgasm but
that really varies from person to person
as well so for some people an orgasm
might last like 30 seconds for other
people can ask last a matter of minutes
and actually women tend to have longer
orgasms than men or a capable of longer
orgasms women when they do orgasm are
also able to have multiple orgasms
pretty consecutively in a row pretty
easily compared to their male
counterparts so once a woman kind of
figures out how to have an orgasm she
actually has more opportunity for longer
orgasms and more of them in comparison
to men however in general more women do
struggle to kind of learn how to orgasm
and I say learn how to orgasm because
one of the biggest difference
is just it's an it's an anatomical
difference right so men they have
basically all of their equipment right
in front of them on the outside you know
their penis is right in front of them
their testicles is right in front of
them so it's it's very easy to kind of
self explore and figure it out what to
do right with women most of the
equipment is internal so it's very
difficult to kind of figure out what
what your body's doing what something
feels like I mean and there's a
difference between a clitoral orgasm and
a graph and burger spot orgasm or a
g-spot orgasm and a lot of women it
takes a lot of exploration before
they're really able to have an orgasm in
either location and a lot of the hold up
for women is just that's many societies
pretty much across the globe many
societies have put restrictions on women
social restrictions moral restrictions
religious restrictions where they're
they're kind of sent this message that
sex is something that they're not
supposed to enjoy and doesn't really
their needs really aren't all that
important in terms of desire arousal and
orgasm and so it's very challenging to
for women not only because of anatomical
differences to orgasm because they have
to learn but they also have to tear down
kind of this societal block or wall that
has been created in their mind around
not being able to orgasm so a couple
things I recommend for people when I see
clients especially women who are
struggling to have an orgasm and they
want to have an orgasm it's okay if
people don't want to orgasm to that's
fine but what I recommend when they do
is a lot of self exploration so getting
to know their own body and then a lot of
just cognitive behavioral therapies to
work on the fact that it's totally
normative and natural to have sexual
feelings and to feel good when you're
engaging in certain behaviors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
