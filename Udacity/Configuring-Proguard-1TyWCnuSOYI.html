of your app by stripping out unused code
and resources it does this with the help
of a tool called ProGuard ProGuard can
do a lot of interesting stuff including
obfuscating your code by giving all your
classes and methods meaningless names
though that's mostly of interest if
you're really worried about your code
being reverse engineered for our
purposes the properties we want to
configure on our build type are minify
enabled and shrink resources in this
project we've declared a dependency on
Google's mobile services library but
we're not actually using anything from
that library pro-gard is smart enough to
figure that out
we'll strip out the unused code from our
apk the mobile services library also
includes many resources like drawables
for sign-in buttons turning on shrink
resources will strip out any unused
resources we've configured to new build
types one of which has turned on
minification and resource shrinking and
one of which has not let's check out the
relative sizes of the APK is generated
by each build type let's run the
assemble task to generate both apks if
we then go find our apks and app build
outputs APK we see that our big APK is
2.9 megabytes
whereas our shrunk apk that was using
minification and resource shrinking is
only 1.2 megabytes there's a lot more
you can do to optimize your apk using
ProGuard we've included some resources
in the course code where you can learn
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
