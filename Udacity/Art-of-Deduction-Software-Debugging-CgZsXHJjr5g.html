make an excellent program debugger if he
were living these days the problem in
front of us can be stated as follows
something impossible occurred and the
only solid information is that it did
occur so we must think backwards from
the result to discover the reasons quote
from Kernighan and pike the practice of
programming thinking backwards from the
result this is the art of deduction
applied to debugging let me illustrate
this how this works
using a familiar example here again we
have a function to remove HTML markup
just as a reminder what this function is
supposed to do is to take HTML input
such as this one a foo text enclosed
into HTML tags 1 to switch on bold
rendering and want to switch off bold
rendering and to turn this into a text
in which the HTML markup has been
removed for this it makes use of a
number of variables tag checks whether
we currently are processing a tag that
is during these three characters tag
should be true and only if we are not in
tag mode do we actually add the
characters to the out variable and the
out variable at the end is being
returned so while we are processing this
code tag would be true for these three
for these three characters then tag
would be false
f oo would be added to the output and
then finally we would have four more
tech characters which would not be added
in the end what we get is this string
foo now let's practice the art of
deduction on this example simply from
the observation that this final
assertion has failed so all we know is
that indeed this code can produce an
output in which HTML markup is still
present this is the observation from
which we start let's go
and think backwards how the assertion
possibly could have failed what we know
is that out contains an opening tag that
is a less than character the only place
where this character could have been
added to the outer variable is here in
order to reach that line number of
conditions must be fulfilled all of
these conditions cannot have held
whereas this one must have held let's
focus on the tag variable here what was
the value of the tag variable when the
less than sign had been added over to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
