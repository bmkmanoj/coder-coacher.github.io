gave you we can figure out which one
belongs to the prey population and which
went to the predator population by
considering the signs of the various
constants in the information that we
gave you we told you that the prey grows
at a constant rate of 0 point 5 per year
so since population growth is of course
positive and depends on the population
already present we can see that this
term a X of T should be part of the
equation dealing with the prey similarly
we told you that the Predators die out
similarly we told you that the Predators
have a fixed life span of five years
this means that the rate of change of
the predator population will have a
negative component that is also directly
proportional to the total population at
a given time this matches this term
right here negative C times y of T so
now that we know that X represents
predator and y represents prey let's
talk about these terms that include an x
times y vector this factor of x times y
represents predator x prey and this is
proportional to basically how often
individuals of the two species meet we
know that whenever a predator meets its
prey the situation ends up being pretty
advantageous for the predator but not so
great for the prey this is shown in our
equations by the fact that this
interaction term in the equation for the
rate of change with a predator
population has a positive sign in front
of it whatever the predator meets its
prey this population can grow and the
opposite is true for the prey population
since this interaction will lead to
members of the parade dying determining
these constants a b c and d should
actually remind you a bit of dealing
with our SI our model problems in unit 3
our coefficients dealing with life span
and growth rate correspond to the
different time constants that we used
for moving people in mosquitoes between
infected recovered and susceptible
populations that since we've already
matched a with the growth rate of the
prey population we can write down a
equals 0 point 5 per year in the same
way since C corresponds to loss in the
predator population we can set its value
equal to 1 over the predator lifespan or
1 over 5 years in order to calculate B
and D the other two constants need to
make use of the last piece of
information that I gave you that our
ocean populations will reach an
equilibrium situation when there are
five times ten to the six tons of prey
and one times ten to the six tons of
predator if we do some simple algebraic
manipulations of the
equations that i showed you above and
also plug in 0 for the rates of change
of either population showing the
equilibrium situation we can solve for B
and D by simply in putting the values
for a and C that we just decided upon
this results in B equaling 5 times 10 to
the negative 7 1 over year times tonnes
de equaling 4 times 10 to the negative 8
1 over a year times tons we plug all
four of these values into base values it
can move on to the next part of the
problem in the function food chain we
implement the forward Euler method using
the rates of change that we just figured
out using our differential equations of
course you've plugged in pray in the
place of X and predator in the place of
why and finally we move on to our
sensitivity analysis to account for the
lower limit of values we make a copy of
the base values dictionary and multiply
each value corresponding to each key by
point nine and we do the same thing for
the upper limits by multiplying each
value by 1.1 these lines down here
select the most critical parameter based
on which parameter has the greatest
difference between its high results in
his low results however we can also
figure out the most critical parameter
by just looking at the plots that we get
we run the program our first plot shows
the amount of prey and tons versus time
and the second shows the amount of
predator in tons versus time the colors
dictionary which you may have seen
toward the top of the code paired each
parameter that we're looking at with a
different color remember we're
interested in seeing which of these
parameters has the greatest impact on
the maximum value of the prey so in
order to pick out the most critical
parameter we need to compare the maximum
amount of prey graph by the upper and
lower curves of either Series in this
top graph we can see for example that if
we look at the yellow curves their
maximum values here and here are not
really that far apart if we look at
every pair of curves that are the same
color we can see that this one that is
cyan or the light blue has the greatest
distance between it speaks looking back
at our colors dictionary we see that
cyan or C is paired with D let's look at
our final graph again for just a little
bit more analysis we can see that both
graphs exhibit a periodic behavior it
looks almost like we have a cosine and
sine function initially our prey
population increases which leads to an
increase in the predator population
shortly afterward this however it leads
to a decrease in the parade population
and so on and so forth back and forth
upon closer inspection
you can see that these are actually not
perfect sine and cosine functions in
fact the forward Euler method leads to a
blow-up of periodic functions over time
we'll see a very clear example of this
explosion of amplitude if we increase
the end time and the step size let's see
what our plot looks like now this is a
very interesting looking plot we can see
that in the predator population we start
with a peak to peak height approximately
60,000 tons and after 200 years have
passed who have peak to peak height
approximately 150,000 tons that's a
pretty dramatic increase if we use a
symplectic Euler method instead of the
forward Euler method here we can prevent
this expansion and amplitude just as we
talked about in our earlier problems
involving mechanics we can see that many
methods prove useful in very different
situations whether dealing with diseases
or fish populations or pendulums great
job on unit 4 and get excited for unit 5
we're going to look at something totally
different how any lock brake systems
