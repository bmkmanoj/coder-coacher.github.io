freedom to samples and populations let's
say these are values in a population we
can pick any n values from this
population to have a sample of size n if
n is 5 let's say we pick these 5 there
are 5 degrees of freedom if we pick a
sample of size n we have n degrees of
freedom but then we have to calculate
the sample standard deviation and to do
this we need the sample mean to find the
mean we add up each value in our sample
divide by the number in our sample and
then we get X bar that means that the
sum of all the values in the sample has
to be X bar times n this is just like
that example you did before where you
have n values that must add to 10 in
that case you had n minus 1 degrees of
freedom and the same applies here in our
population when we need to pick a sample
of size n we now have a restriction the
nth value has to ensure that they add to
X bar times n in other words n minus one
of the values may vary as long as the
nth value results in that same sum to
get the same average n minus 1 is called
the effective sample size since the
sample standard deviation depends on X
bar there are n minus 1 degrees of
freedom
you might ask well why do we divide by n
with the population standard deviation
if that also uses X bar well with a
population we can't replace certain
values with other values like we can
with samples because we already have all
possible values of the population
degrees of freedom are the number of
pieces of information that can be freely
varied without violating any given
restrictions think of degrees of freedom
as the number of independent pieces of
information available to estimate
another piece of information only n
minus 1 values are independent after we
know the mean as the degrees of freedom
increases the T distribution better
approximates the normal distribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
