introduce to you dr. Yusuf Khaleel
Yousuf as I call him graduated from
Georgia Tech in 1989 and and then after
he graduated from Georgia Tech with a
PhD in computer science and I'm very
proud to say that he was my first PhD
student he went to work for sun
microsystems where he was developing
multiprocessor operating systems and
then at some point of time microsoft
found in and he moved to microsoft and
while he was at son he was a CTU of the
Solaris MC product and some of which we
saw in our own discussion of structure
of operating systems early on and and
then he moved to Microsoft and Microsoft
he developed the peril he developed the
current cloud platform which is called
the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and
that's the one that he's been leading he
was a distinguished engineer at Sun
Microsystems and then now he is a
distinguished engineer Microsoft and so
it's a great pleasure to have you Thank
You Keisha for having me and I just
wanna say that Kishore was a great
professor part the tougher faster and I
wanted to tell tell that to my students
even though I'm sorry but that's the
truth so use of its it's a pleasure
always to meet you and see you and and
the thing that is really exciting for me
is being able to bring you back to this
interview because this is interview is
going to be part of the course that I'm
developing I in advanced operating
systems and and and you contributed a
lot to that and so what I want to do is
first sort of rewind back to the the mid
to late 80s when you were a PhD student
and and you developed as part of your
dissertation work the clouds distributed
operating system and then fast forward
to 2013 you're hitting the cloud
as your platform at Microsoft talk to us
about your journey and and if you can
connect the dots from what you did back
then to what you're doing now you know
in many ways things have changed and
many other ways things have not changed
at all so the fundamentals are the same
the structure of an OS the way you layer
the system the basic concept of security
isolation all these separation policy
and mechanism simplicity of design
recovery from failures on the like all
these concepts still apply by the same
time things have changed quite a bit
give you an example the product you
mentioned at you and I worked on clouds
and from 85 86 289 to the distributed
system true but we had exactly three
machines growing it grew to four or five
machines later on that was it I mean we
had to manage three four fire machines
lots of algorithms which are very
similar today but the scale wasn't the
same fast forward today I can't even
tell you how many machines how many vm
is run in a public lot millions millions
of VMs on all over the place so the
scale have been going up by order than
orders of magnitude so the fundamentals
are the same but the problem at hand
have changed and of course the physics
and the how the industry moved before I
give a machine was what vax 11 750 this
is an old machine now of course not well
I mean been many many students may not
even know about back 77 you fight them
in a hit in history museum correct way
to severe as big as up and the company
doesn't exist that movement is gone the
machine is gone but was the best machine
over there is for a while as big as this
and probably my watch or my phone has
order of magnitude more power than this
so you know okay this is just how the
agency moved so again the concepts are
the same the fundamental are the same
some of the papers that will now teach
and learn from are the same ones that
were written back then even before but
their application now have been applied
to a much much bigger scale so the short
answer here
and the skill of course you see
everywhere all of us have some devices
some smartphone or some machine or a PC
and the like and all these services out
there are using the better conductor the
connectivity that computing the power of
the collective if you are that's new as
one before we used to apply all these
concepts in the small to again a machine
to a server now we apply them to a
collective so is it fair to say that
some of the techniques that were
invented in the 80s and the 90s are
still applicable today it is just that
the scale of Ghana very much so I mean
the fundamentals of distributed
computing replication algorithms
consistence leader election
synchronization all these are of course
the bread and butter of their what we do
that's a given but at the same time
since things have changed when we scale
changes by one two three orders of
magnitude some algorithms break so we
have to think of terms of maybe lose
consistency is it a very absolute
consistency you will need to think of
handling failures in a different way
optimized for me come to recovery versus
making it perfect the first time through
so um in as you know a couple of science
we think changed by this much there some
things have to move but the fundamentals
are the same lecture really comforting a
piece of news for the students because
some of the papers that we read are from
the 90s and the 80s and their classic
thing what did I tell them why they are
the classic even go before that as I
know exactly somebody said that was
wasn't me that nothing has been invented
in our field for the last 20 years or so
and again they're partially right The
Phantom it is all the same so you have
to start with the basics and you belong
top of them right right so I want to ask
specifically with respect to Microsoft
Azure it uses the platform as a service
model for the cloud now discuss why that
model is the one that you chose and what
are the pros and cons of that that model
be sure so just really tell you we in
Azure we have a whole spectrum now let
them at the service infrastructure has
service all combined to build basically
services so called software the service
first I want to start by telling you I'm
a fan of these terms they're not
technical at all today you know the
industry at time is want to put things
in this separate segments separate
segments but but you know the definition
of them are left my service you
typically have api's and services out of
which you compose other services whereas
infrastructure service who typically
just compelled VMs virtual machines and
you accentuate them real life of course
is more complex than that it's a
combination and Azure like other systems
support both the long-term direct
direction though many applications are
not a tea from scratch anymore you
compose existing components there was a
time before I was in this field you know
people destroyed machine language then
assembly language the Euro spank me B&amp;amp;C
and so forth and you start with a
program out to scratch from nothing now
fast forward to today everything is
composed so you may have some storage
services some database services some
cashing services some identity services
and you compose the application after
them and that's we had the way to go
from now on and then you compose things
out of those compositions to restful api
is under like so in this spectrum I
that's why I'm not a very fair on those
terms you know yes they have a
definition yes you can look at them and
apply them but what's more interesting
is to have a very large scalable
reliable platform with rich services
that allows you to run if you want to
VMS all the way to compose abs are very
high level so in that sense what I'm
hearing you say is that these
distinctions are not that important
architectural easily whatever for our
feet I don't think it serves more of a
marketing marketing or our way to
simplify concepts okay remember cloud
computing instance of early on and if
which feeds are early sometimes people
have to define terms just to build to
reason about the concepts to me speaking
for myself I really think it's far more
important to look at the actual services
API as you have
and what can you do with them to make a
lot me to develop applications and to
run them reliably at scale now students
get to know about these giant scale
services and how cloud computing is
enabling these giant scale services what
do you see is the future evolution of
system structure for providing
distributed services is it going to be
same more of the same or is it going to
be drastically different in the future
to be honest if I knew exactly I will
probably like we nobody knows exactly
but we can look at a trend and the trend
has alluded to shift it from the old
days where we used to have three
machines in our data center you and I
you have three machines way we used to
have me frames bigger than this room
were in at the moment it's shifting to
more of a scale-out model where it's
built out of smaller servers of the
shelf components and many many of them
that's dictating a trend in application
structure and format that's different
than before you are no longer looking at
big S&amp;amp;P boxes and apt optimizing a big
SME box looking an application that you
may have multiple cores in a box but has
to live across boxes across servers and
has to deal with failures and has to
deal with the network as a as a reality
latency is there and so forth so the
shift will be more and more towards
scale out horizontal scaling which is
scale up and mod Frank towards
simplicity we're failures will happen
and you have to optimize for recovery
from failures and to be forward progress
said differently old all our apps today
are what you know back back in service
to your phone to your PC it your laptop
your pad etc they expect the network to
be always there the expected service
will be always there of course it's not
true but you have to design it as it to
make sure it can handle failures for it
to appear to be always there so
disconnected operation of the network is
important cashing in
and the whole stack is important and
when a component fails you need to have
to state somewhere else the truth has to
be in the network not anywhere else so
those I think trends will only
accelerate exactly what they're going to
be in they need from now I'm not sure
five years probably like I described now
so I think you started touching on this
already in your answer so what do you
see changing in the data centers for
catering to these kinds of future
evolution of distributed services number
of things are changing a data center
first given the econ Z scaled we have by
having the horizontal model you have an
increasing concentration of computing
power in a effectively in a flat network
so when you said horizontal model
perhaps you an elaborate okay so in a
horizontal model if you want extra
capacity you end up adding more servers
to our network so you may start with one
server with maybe one cpu with multiple
cores automotive memory if you want more
capacity like extra memory or extra of
course you don't open up the box and add
to it there's nothing to add to open the
box is closed you add more boxes and
being figurative here but you don't want
to make me so this is as the contrast
how it used to be in the password you
bought one big mainframe one big chassis
and he added more stuff inside it to
make it bigger so you have two new
networks if you do know distributed
systems it's a fact of life basically so
the trend is basically go that way if
you should go to a modern data center
now a truly modern one you're going to
find a network which is fairly flat
network where it caters both to South
East traffic and west east-west traffic
which in different words it can do well
to take requests send and send them back
out all to do traffic within the network
meaning computation the computationally
and data replication okay so that's a
trend that's definitely happening so
scale-up model of many many servers
typically commodity servers they're
fairly small the increase of course with
Moore's law but still look really small
and network which is fairly flat so you
can do a lot of traffic between them
an application that are basically laid
over that network and what the app
itself is mostly mostly structure in a
way can withstand any piece going down
and the state replicated and different
theaters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
