we've alluded to already you have a
complex system it has multiple pieces to
it and that means that a piece might go
down or it might be overloaded okay at
some particular point and how does the
rest of the system respond to that
overall we can call that a reliability
question that is what percentage of the
time is the overall application
providing the services that it should be
providing typically you learn about a
reliability problem when some message
that is sent is not delivered or at
least you don't get an acknowledgement
back from it when strategy is to try
sending the message again the danger
there of course is that the recipient
receives two copies of the message and
does whatever action is doing twice
which also may be a problem this is an
example of a classic reliability
performance trade-off that is whenever
you use replication that's going to take
more time and more resources as well as
as compromising the integrity of the
system you can do it faster but it may
not be as reliable various policies for
dealing with reliability issues have
arisen such as the client making its
best effort the clients saying it will
do at most once as far as message
sending at least once exactly once and
so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
