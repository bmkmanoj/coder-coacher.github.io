milestones are a series of projects that
are built to introduce you to the major
paradigms major ideas and machine
learning we're going to start with a big
picture we're going to start with some
materials that cover the entire
landscape machine learning and
artificial intelligence then we'll get
into model building and validation
machine learning is really about
building models that describe data and
then validating them against some
metrics are comparing them against one
another then we'll get into the nuts and
bolts of machine learning will cover
supervised learning unsupervised
learning and reinforcement learning
these are different tools in your
toolbox can be used to address different
kinds of problems and that's important
because machine learning isn't just
about being able to use a certain
algorithm or do a certain technique it's
about knowing when to do it and how to
evaluate the results those are the real
learning goals we want you to come away
with this we want you to know how to do
certain machine learning techniques but
we also really want you to understand
when to use them and toward that end at
the end of the nanodegree program you're
going to take on your own project you're
going to take on your own problem that
you want to address use some of the
techniques that you've learned you're
going to decide what is appropriate for
this kind of problem what is appropriate
for this question what technique should
I apply and how do I evaluate the
results that I get out of it because
you're choosing that project yourself as
well you'll come away with a standard
agree program was something that no one
else can claim a contribution that no
one has made before a real testament to
your mastery of machine learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
