things that didn't matter like the
background color of a specific button or
the specific experience when a user is
clicking back but is not logged in all
kinds of like side things that it won't
move the needle and I that's really
metal and it's very important to to make
sure that the experience is perfect and
you're nailing it on the first time but
you need to make sure that the product
is right and not the buttons need to
make sure that the general flow and the
problem that is being solved with your
product is like and not the specific
background color or the perfect logo or
the responsiveness of the website
because that that's optimization you'll
do that in the a/b testing part to do
that after you nail your MVP but we did
that we for win8 the MVP and we wasted a
lot of time on that and I wish we hadn't
it will not happen again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
