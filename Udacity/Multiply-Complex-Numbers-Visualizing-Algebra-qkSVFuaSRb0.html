and the second answer is 22 plus 49 if
you figure either one of these out great
work we start this first one by
distributing 4i 22 and 23 I 4i times 2
equals a tie and 4i times 3i equals
positive 12 x squared this is just kind
of like x times X we know x times X is x
squared so I times I is I squared okay
here comes the important part we want to
substitute I squared with a value of
negative 1 so here's an I squared so
I'll replace it with negative 1 this is
the key step to multiply complex numbers
you already know about distribution and
you already know about combining like
terms but you might not have known about
that substitution this is how we get a
result of positive 12 less a tie for
complex numbers we usually list the real
part first followed by the imaginary
part this is why I put the negative 12
here we either have a plus bi or we have
a minus bi these are the two forms that
we'll see for our second problem we
start by distributing this positive 3 to
the 4 and 2 negative 2i next we want to
distribute the 5 I to our second
parentheses well have 5i times positive
four and 5i times negative 2i we can
clean up our multiplication to get 12-6
i plus 20 i minus ten i squared we have
like terms of I so negative six side and
20 i equals positive 14 I the other
terms stay the same next we have I
squared so we need to replace that with
negative 1 this means we'll have
negative 10 times negative 1 which will
equal positive 10 whenever we have an i
square term it essentially makes the
number negative like here we had 12 i
squared and we get negative 12 whereas
here we have negative 10 i squared and
we get positive 10 now we're ready to
combine our final like terms of 12 and
10 to get our final result now again
don't worry if you struggle with this
one you have a chance at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
