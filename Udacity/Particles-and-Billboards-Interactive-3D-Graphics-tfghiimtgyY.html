square that has a transparency map is to
create a bunch of these and have them
move around when a large number of
objects like this move around we call
them particles this demo has 100,000
particles one particularly useful way to
display particles is as if they're 2d
objects flat on the screen the objects
are actually in a 3d world however as
the camera moves these objects are
reoriented so that they always face
forward in this example we see squares
moving about with each square always
facing the viewer you can then apply a
texture with an alpha channel to get an
interesting look by using transparency
mapping you can put whatever you want on
a particle here are a bunch of dots
moving around an advantage of particles
is that they can directly represent 3d
scan to data for example here's some
movement data captured using a Kinect is
displayed with particles some
researchers and developers are actively
looking at how to use particles as basic
building blocks instead of triangles
here's an example for Marcus shoots on
his poetry org site that shows a
realistic view made entirely of
particles this data was captured by a
laser scan system by Faro Technologies
one advantage of particle systems is
that the data can be captured by a
scanner and then directly viewed no
processing is needed to reconstruct any
triangles or meshes this program is
running in the browser with more
particles flowing in and filling in the
gaps the longer you view it that's one
advantage of particles you can stream
them in as you wish a bit by bit with
triangles you tend to send in either
some simplified mesh or the whole object
causing objects to pop into existence
the particles themselves can be made to
look more realistic you can use any
texture you want when you're doing
transparency mapping by using a sphere
texture instead of a circle these
particles are more convincing as 3d
objects weather is a common use for
particle systems for making snowflakes
or rain drops for phenomena like rain
particles can have a lifetime where
they're created fall through the sky and
when they hit the ground they disappear
particles usually face the viewer this
idea of having objects always face
forward is called bill boarding it
allows us to make 2d textures seem more
like 3d objects as we've seen this demo
shows a popular use for transparent
textures on billboards simulating clouds
this demo is by the main author of three
j/s in fact larger billboards of cloud
shapes are combined and overlapped to
give the
illusion of puffiness I have to conclude
with one of the cliches of computer
graphics the lens flare it's so easy to
add this effect that it's been in many
games though there probably have been
more games with crates the sparkling
patterns that simulate interaction of
light with the cameras parts are all
transparent textures whose positions are
computed on the fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
