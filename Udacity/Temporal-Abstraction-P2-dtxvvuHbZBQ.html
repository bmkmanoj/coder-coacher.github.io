appreciate you giving me credit for
thinking this idea but the the reality
of it is you you kind of forced my hand
by not like I couldn't said right right
right right right right down because I
don't see the low-level grid positions
so I don't know if it's a hundred or a
thousand or sixty or anything but um but
cool I mean that gives me credit for
something that I don't really deserve
well but I did give you I did tell you
that you can go up down left right if
you'd said well I tell you to go right I
just would have moved right a little bit
and you would have seen where it was and
you got to keep going right keep going
right keep going right and yeah I could
have made that as granular as I wanted
to but it has to be fairly granular
there's no way to get from here to
through the doorway through one of the
doorways what you absolutely have to do
so let's let's be a little bit more
concrete so let's write down exactly
what that action was I don't know what
it is but you created a bunch of actions
that I'm gonna say or things like go to
doorway and we can even name those
doorways let's call them X and so that
would be one two three four more actions
which are gonna allow me to say possibly
many many steps so let's think about
that what if I had started here what
would you have told me well in principle
the plan that I gave you could still
work this go to the doorway to the east
and then go to the doorway to the south
right and by the way well go ahead well
I just it seems like the room layout
that you have makes it possible to go
the kind of a southerly route as well
right there's some point where going
east in the south is not as good as
going south and then east so and I don't
know exactly what that point is but I'll
make it easy for you by drawing a dot
there what would you tell me to do there
I would totally tell you to go east and
then south right so east to the doorway
south to the doorway and down right so
for a whole bunch of states inside of
this room no matter what I do the action
is the same even though I'm in different
states I should still just go here I
take one action for one particular state
so the plan itself and sort of what I'm
searching over is actually much simpler
and that would be true for I think
probably any space inside of this room
your answer would be should go to the
south door right and you know not to
drive the point home too much but what
about from here well you I think it's
obviously telling me to go here from
here you tell me to go here from here
you tell me to go here at some point
there's a switch off between
they're going through this door going
through this doors the right thing to do
but there you go and then once you're in
the room well then you're gonna have to
take I guess sort of baby steps towards
the goal but regardless I'm gonna claim
that this is an easier kind of space to
reason over than having to live in the
original action space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
