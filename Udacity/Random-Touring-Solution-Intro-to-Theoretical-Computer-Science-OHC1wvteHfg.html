don't know that the shortest tour for
the input graph has length 1056 that's
the smallest one that we happen to have
found but if we ran the algorithm
numerous more times then we might find a
smaller one and the only thing we know
for certain is that the minimum vertex
cover is at least 618 because of our
factor two approximation we also don't
know that the random algorithm is likely
a factor three approximation again
because we would need to run it many
many more times to really be certain of
that now we have found a tour that is at
most one point seven one times as long
as the optimal one because we found a
tour of length 1056 and we know that the
optimal one is at least 618 which is
1.71 now we have not found a tour that
isn't most one point four three times as
long as the optimal one and if we plug
that into our previous equation and we
solved for X then we would get x equals
1 point 4 3 times 6 18 which is about
883 which we didn't find a tour of 883
so that is not true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
