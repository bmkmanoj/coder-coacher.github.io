what you were doing so I thought I would
verify that by giving you a very easy
quiz it doesn't look so easy it is easy
so here's the quiz to help you I've
ridden up both the Bellman's equation
and the update that we would give to
utilities
I'm the collected to write the little
hats and everything because I just don't
think you need that but these are the
two equations that you need to be able
to think about this is just what we've
written up before and I've written down
the grid world we've been playing with
the entire time and I want you to figure
out how value duration would work from
the first iteration in the second
iteration for this particular state here
that I've marked with an X okay okay all
right and they're a little more
information you need to go gamma in this
case is going to be equal to one half
mainly because it's easy to do the math
if you do it that way
the rewards just remind you for all of
the states except for the two goal or
absorbing states is going to be minus
point zero four and my initial arbitrary
utilities for all of the states is going
to be zero except in the two absorbing
States where I already know the
utilities are one and minus one
respectively
okay okay you got all that I think so
you're sure and I feel confident that
I'm going to slip ups but okay yeah I
think I can take a stab at this all
right so gammas 1/2 rewards or minus
point zero for arbitrary starting
utilities at time zero zero except here
at the absorbing states tell me how the
utility here will evolve after one step
or one iteration and two steps or two
iterations
okay then go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
