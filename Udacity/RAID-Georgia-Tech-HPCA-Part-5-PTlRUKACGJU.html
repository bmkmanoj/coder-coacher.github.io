independent disks and effectively with
raid we have several disks that play the
role of only one disk in different ways
they can either pretend to be a larger
disk or they can pretend to be a more
reliable disk or they can pretend to be
the disk that is both larger and
reliable than when one of the disks now
it's important to note before we go into
explaining raid that each of the disks
is still detecting errors using codes so
each of the disks will know whether it
has an error and in the overall rate
scheme we will know which of the disks
have an error so we don't have to have
raid figure that out we know that
because each of the disks still has a
code at each sector that is capable of
both fixing some errors and also
detecting even more errors on that
sector so what we want from raid is
better performance and we want normal
read/write accomplishment basically
service accomplishment as far as disk is
concerned even when there are things
such as bad sectors on some disks or an
entire disk fails for example because it
can no longer span and things of that
nature so things that a basic error
detection and correction code that is
attached to each sector cannot fix
anymore possibly because we can no
longer get to that sector on the disk
not all of the raid techniques will
improve both of these some improve only
performance some improve only
reliability some improve both and these
rate techniques are numbered so there is
raid 0 raid 1 etc and we will look at
some of these techniques</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
