so you might have been tempted to choose
the first one here because it's the
shortest because you're trying to
respect the fact that Debbie is on the
go and she's busy and doesn't have a lot
of time to engage with your application
but actually she'll have to spend more
time if you use a notification like this
she actually has to press the
notification and go into the app to see
what book is overdue and for how long it
actually doesn't really tell her
anything so in the end this is actually
a really bad choice the second one might
look tempting because it does give her
some more information but she still has
to either launch a navigation app if she
doesn't know where the library is she
might be really far away or if she wants
to extend the books let's say that your
application allows her to do that she
still has to go into the M and that's
not really respecting her limited time
and her split attention at the real
world so the best one is the third
option because in one glanceable
notification she can completely engage
with your application and not actually
have to enter it and she has these nice
contextual actions where she can extend
the book or navigate there with just one
button press that was awesome I did
notice one thing debbie is holding her
phone with a single hand ah yes that
brings us into our next mobile
constraint which is handedness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
