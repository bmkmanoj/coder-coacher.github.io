and reaction time experiment the
caffeine group is called the
experimental group and the no caffeine
group is called the placebo or control
group we just mentioned the mean which
is another statistical tool that we use
in psychological experiments the mean is
the average of all scores so for our
caffeine and reaction time experiment we
took each individual's reaction time and
got an average so for our experimental
group the average or means score on
reaction time was zero point three five
to seven seconds and for our control or
placebo group our average reaction time
was zero point five six to one so what
does this difference mean we ran another
statistical test and we found that the
difference between the experimental
group and the control group was
statistically significant but what does
that mean it means that it is highly
unlikely that the scores we observed
were due by chance so again in this calf
een and reaction study we can say that
the significant difference between point
three and point five seconds occurred
most likely because of the caffeine and
not because of some other variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
