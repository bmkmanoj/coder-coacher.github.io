first chocolate cake I've split it up
into thirds are three equal pieces I
have one third of it covered in
strawberry icing for the second cake I
have half of it covered in vanilla icing
one half but I don't have to separate
cakes here I just have one cake covered
in all that frosting so here's what
these pieces would look like together on
one cake so I have half of it covered in
vanilla and a third of it covered in
strawberry if I compare the frosted part
to the two fifths part I can easily see
that this is more than two-fifths so you
said more than two fifths nice work it's
not that obvious but if you draw
diagrams it can definitely help support
your reasoning so let's try looking at
this with some math I had half of the
cake vanilla icing and a third of the
cake and strawberry icing many students
think that adding fractions together is
the same as adding numbers or integers
together they would say one plus one
makes two + 2 + 3 makes five many
students sink one half and one third is
two-fifths but when i look at my diagram
i know that can't be right i already
have half of the cake and vanilla icing
and a little bit more in strawberry
icing I know this much is frosted and
that's way bigger than two-fifths so we
need another way to add these fractions
together this won't work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
