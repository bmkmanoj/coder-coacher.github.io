business problem is business
understanding some questions you can ask
to help understand the business issues
are what decisions need to be made what
information is needed to inform those
decisions and what type of analysis can
provide the information needed to inform
those decisions typically developing a
mental model of the business issue helps
a great deal in structuring the
potentially relevant information needed
to perform the analysis let's review a
specific business problem to help
illustrate business issue understanding
how much electricity capacity does a
utility company need to supply for any
given hour tomorrow first let's discuss
what decisions need to be made in this
scenario we're looking to answer this
question so the organization can decide
how to supply the needed power they'll
need to predict whether or not they'll
have enough capacity so they can
determine which plants they can bring
online or if they need to purchase
electricity in the marketplace the
critical information that needs to be
known is how much electricity will be
demanded in each hour of the day
tomorrow
unfortunately this information is not
known at the time decisions need to be
made so the demand for each hour
tomorrow needs to be predicted which
will allow the company to make
appropriate decisions about what plans
to turn on and if they'll need to buy
extra electricity or not therefore we
know that we need a predictive analysis
to help us obtain the data to inform the
decision we need to make we don't have
enough information at this point to know
the type of predictive analysis without
a better understanding of the data that
is needed and the data we have available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
