but what points lie on this function
let's figure it out here's a table for
you to fill out that we can organize
this information well however in order
to do this you're probably going to need
to use a calculator since the numbers
are going to get really big really fast
if you don't own a calculator it's easy
to find one online by searching for
scientific calculator and if you do have
your own scientific calculator it should
have a button that makes evaluating
exponential expressions very simple in
fact Google makes a calculator that's
very easy to find and very easy to use
here it is it comes up right when you
search scientific calculator on Google
this is what i'll be using today to do
our calculations as you can see this
calculator has a button that says x to
the y on it now if i want to calculate
six to the third power for example i
would press six then I oh press X to the
y and then I would press three you can
see that the calculator is showing us 62
the third when I press equals that gives
me the number that's equal to which is
216 let's try another one maybe I want
to find 4 to the negative fifth well I
press four then our lovely x to the Y
button and then I type negative 5 great
ic 4 to the negative fifth which is what
we're looking for pressing enter tells
me that it's this long exponent let's
practice using that button on our
calculator to find different points on
this function for each value of x I've
written here please fill in the
corresponding value of H of X in other
words find 5 to the X for each of these
X values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
