function to tell a story the story I
want to tell is for overall the state's
let's group the states in terms of the
number of pending points in that state
and then for each of those number of
pending points say all the states for
which there are 10 points pending how
many times did max winds decide to roll
versus how many times did max disks
decide to roll and just to consider the
ones in which the to differ so throw
away all the states in which they take
the same action let's see what that
looks like let me just describe briefly
what I do so I start off I have a
default dictionary and the default is
that I have two values 0 for max wins
and 0 for max diffs then I go through
get the two strategy functions to apply
to the state if they're differed figure
out what pending is and increment the
pending count for the person who decided
to roll and then I just go and print
them out and here's the result and it
does tell a story look what's happening
when I have a small number of point
spending most of the time the two
strategies agree but when they differ
it's the max diff strategy that's
deciding to roll but has the number of
points increase the number of pending
points increase we see its max wins
who's willing to roll and max disc not
at all so that's a perfect segregation
between the two in this crossover point
around between 13 and 16 we're here max
wins is rolling all the time with with
very high pending amounts but max diffs
is never willing to do that so what must
be happening here is you know here are
three hundred times max wins has 24
pending points and he's willing to roll
it must be because the opponent is just
about to win and he says even though I'm
risking 24 I still want to win the game
so I gotta roll back stiff says are you
crazy I got 24 points on the board I'm
going to reap them right now and yes I
may lose but i'm really going to cut
down that differential so look what the
story told us i thought that this man in
the arena who is playing the max diff
strategy was going to impress the NPA
scouts by playing aggressively and it
turned out that the story was completely
different so what does that tell us well
first it tells us that
there's an interesting distinction about
how we wrote our function to maximize
differential note that the way we wrote
it is we completely separated the what
which is the rules of the game for how
big is is played from the how of how
does it make decisions and that was the
perfectly general best actions so we
didn't go in and say we're going to
write specific rules for pig to say if
you're in such and such a position do
such and such rather we just said here's
how pig works here's what I'm trying to
do maximize differential you do the rest
and so the results that came back were
surprising to me because I didn't really
understand how the what and the how
interacted but I was still able to write
a program that maximized the
differential even though I didn't
understand what that program was
actually doing and that's the power of
breaking up these aspects into what's
happening versus maximizing and the
second part that's interesting here is
that I was able to do exploration so it
wasn't just that I built a monolithic
program that could do one thing is that
i built a set of tools that could
explore the area and when I wanted to
understand something that was different
from what I originally did I was able to
do that because I had the tools around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
