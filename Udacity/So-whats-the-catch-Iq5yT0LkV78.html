are certainly some downsides to be aware
of by definition a library is reusable
and generic if it was custom-built for
your app it would be easier to call it
your code that means that libraries may
include more than what you need and
bloat what could be a lean app or maybe
not even cover the cases you need and of
course libraries are built by developers
and that means there may be bugs
architectures that don't work well with
your existing app or trade-offs such as
quality versus memory consumption that
you may not be able to control in
addition not every library ages
gracefully they may not be a taking
advantage of the newest api's hampering
your ability to build the best user
experience or they may have been in
bandon entirely leaving you stranded
when faced with an issue or bug goes to
show picking the right library might be
the most important stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
