David Kibby
president and CEO of direct trust and a
senior adviser to the American Academy
of Family Physicians the largest primary
care physician organization in the
United States so good morning David
and thank you very much for taking the
time to be with us today
good morning Marc it's a pleasure to be
here so at this point the students are
aware of direct trust and the role it
plays in establishing trust across HISPs
but of course with with health IT
adoption is always an issue so where is
direct trust in terms of adoption at
this point yeah well we've made a lot of
progress mark in the last year your
students are I'm sure aware of direct as
a protocol on a set of specifications
they're probably not aware of the extent
to which direct service providers have
been active in this sector of the
industry direct trusts membership has
grown from about 50 members this time
last year to over 135 members we now
have 33 health ISPs or HISPs who are
providing services to a range of
customers and clients including
electronic health records and of course
the electronic health records are
providing direct to their customers who
are provider organizations and
individuals in those organizations we
also have hie s some federal agencies
now and a growing number of personal
health records who are involved so right
now that network serves approximately
6,000 to 7,000 healthcare organizations
there are over 250,000 direct addresses
that have been provisioned for those
parties in those organizations and those
numbers have been doubling every three
months so we think that by the beginning
of 2015 there will be approximately 200
electronic health records depending on
direct
Trust accredited service providers and
approximately a million direct addresses
being supplied within the provider
community nationwide well that's
certainly impressive in health IT right
up there with adoption is his use cases
the purposes to which technology is used
to improve care you've told me about a
very interesting example in hospitals
that have transitions of care where
patients are leaving the hospital and
going to a long-term care facility could
you tell us a bit about that yeah
certainly you know a couple things to
keep in mind is that we're clearly
seeing a network effect per the hockey
stick curve of adoption is growing very
quickly but we're also seeing that
there's a long tail here in terms of use
cases the primary use case that's
driving the adoption of direct exchange
right now is of course stage 2
meaningful use as hospitals and medical
practices seek to meet the transitions
of care and patient engagement
objectives in stage 2 meaningful use
which require direct exchange hospitals
are probably the most active now in
terms of using direct exchange to send
referral documents in particular
transitions of care clinical summary
both to provider organizations on
discharge of the patients or just before
but also to skilled nursing facilities
so we have a growing number of skilled
nursing facilities and rehab centers
that are strictly speaking not
meaningful users but they are endpoints
for meaningful users and are starting to
see that the need for them to have
direct exchange capabilities I would add
to that the claims attachment is a
growing use case again not related to
meaningful use and the federal agencies
have referral needs to replace facts and
eFax and mail with direct exchange and
that's also growing quickly another
interesting example I believe it was in
Tennessee in Kentucky is they used to
direct by Health Department
to collect a very patient specific data
about those patients with sexually
transmitted diseases can you tell us a
bit about that yeah that's a that's a
really exciting grassroots use case and
we've seen several like this around the
country in rural areas of the country
and this is this involves a clinics
public health clinics in two states
Kentucky and Tennessee using direct
exchange for patients who they refer to
one another or see in common and those
are patients with STDs as you mentioned
they are also involving a in army base
Fort Campbell that has its own clinic
and just been contacted by the
Department of Defense we have a meeting
next week to talk about how we can
provide how they can provide direct
services at their installations within
the coming months well so the use cases
we've talked about so far our provider
to provider the students are familiar
with view download and transmit the VDT
requirement meaningful use to that would
seem like a role for direct what can you
tell us about about that the use of
direct exchange by providers and
patients to communicate protected health
information is it an enormous potential
we have about 15 companies indirect
trusts who are what I call
next-generation personal health records
these are personal health record
companies like healthy circles that are
contemplating or actually implementing
now direct services for their customers
who are primarily patients and consumers
not providers so that that could grow
very quickly but it requires first that
the provider to provider infrastructure
be in place I don't expect to see
large-scale use of direct exchange in
the provider excuse me in the consumer
space until 2015 because the it's it you
know if you want to communicate with
your provider using direct which is
wonderful idea
secure messaging with attachments or you
want devices to send direct messages to
your provider organization the provider
organization has to be capable of
receiving those messages than
attachments first and we're very much in
it still in that building phase on the
provider side Jay you mentioned
something that I hadn't really thought
about before are the device
manufacturers the companies that are
hoping to put devices into patients
homes so that patients for the disease
for example can be monitored more
continuously are they sing direct as the
technology they want to build into these
devices yes without question there's you
know one of the things that gives me
real confidence that direct is a
disruptive innovation is this effect
you're starting to see where of course
we're talking about s/mime / SMTP email
messages with attachments but there's a
lot of innovation occurring around use
of that very simple technology to
replace interfaces of various kinds
including device to device interactions
or device - server interactions and
connections that innovation is sort of
quiet at this time there's not a lot of
noise around it but there's significant
interest on the part of device
manufacturers and also the payers for
example who believe that Direct can be a
last mile from the device or from the
data center to some endpoint which could
be the provider providers Inbox
well one final question no you know of
course there are always challenges it
sounds like the exciting times for
direct and direct trust but what do you
see is the most significant challenges
that have to be overcome in them next a
few years for direct to really achieve
its potential you know it always goes
back to some payment or business
rationale right now the incentives for
provider organizations to exchange
information with one another easily and
affordably
using standards like direct is it's not
strong it's growing with the movement of
a cos but I think we still have
hesitancy on the part of providers to
move data when they're getting paid for
duplicating care for example I also
think that we have to overcome the
stigma of patients asking will providers
their providers and the provider
organizations for that information
they're still as hesitancy on the part
of many institutions to make it easy for
patients to get their information having
a standard in place of course helps but
it doesn't motivate people standards are
not motivators standards are enablers
well David I thank you again I
particularly thank you for your final
comments which just emphasize again
something I tried to get a course in
this course which is that without the
right incentives all the technologies in
the world won't change healthcare that's
I would agree with that statement very
strong remark thank you for the
opportunity to speak with your with your
audience with your class and if there
are individuals who want to contact me
