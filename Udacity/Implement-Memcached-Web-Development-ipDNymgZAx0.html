that you're writing memcached and at the
heart of memcached is a dictionary it's
a big hash table so what I'd like you to
do is implement these four main memcache
functions we just talked about three of
them set get and delete and I'd also
also like you to write flush let's go
through what each of these should do so
set takes two parameters key and value
and it sets the value of key in cash to
equal value and it returns true after
setting the data the importance of this
will become apparent in the next quiz
yet takes a key and if the value is in
the cache it returns the value and if
it's not in the cache it returns none
delete takes a key and it deletes that
key from the cache and flush takes no
parameters and clears the entire cache
and so the behavior you should see after
you've implemented this so if you were
to set X to 1 it would return true if
you were to get X it would return 1
because we just set it to 1 if we were
to get Y which doesn't exist we would
see none and if we were to delete X and
then get it we would see none none of
these functions should be particularly
complicated go ahead and give that a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
