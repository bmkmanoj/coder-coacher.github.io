small screen this might seem like the
most obvious mobile constraint and it
basically means that we can't fit as
much on a really small smartphone screen
but there's two really awesome
techniques that we can use that will
help us optimize for our small UI yeah
they're called combination and reflow
and we're gonna talk to an Android
designer developer called Nick butcher
he's on the Android team about how to
make this work in your applications so
Android is not a one-size-fits-all OS it
comes in many different sizes and shapes
from small phones to large tablets TVs
and beyond the great news is that
Android has been built from the ground
up to embrace this variety and give you
tools in order to deal with it so from
the very beginnings Android has allowed
you to scale your user interface up and
down between different devices the
problem is that scaling approaches will
only get you so far so I'm going to take
you through some of the common pitfalls
we see with this and relying on scaling
approaches and then I'm going to go
through some alternative ways of dealing
with this so the first problem we see
commonly is one of having an excessive
line lengths so in this application the
texts and images are running the full
width of the devices screen on a smaller
phone size device this might be fine but
as you get beyond a certain size this
becomes uncomfortable when you
especially your look when you're looking
at line lengths of text you want to be
aiming for between 45 and 75 characters
of text in order to maintain a
comfortable reading experience the user
can easily scan across it in this
application where you can see that this
is clearly exceeding that the next
problem we commonly see is one of
unbalanced content so in this example we
can see there's a lot of content
clustered up in the top left of the
screen and then leaving huge amounts of
whitespace across the rest of the screen
this leads to a very kind of unbalanced
feeling which makes your application
feel completely an optimize for this
device and the last problem we commonly
see is more of a missed opportunity or
most of not making the best use of the
real-estate available to you so in this
example we might have an application
which shows many photos and as we can
see that these tiny little thumbnails or
group
to one side it really is a shame not to
make the use of these beautiful big
screens and went all this extra real
estate when it is available to you and
so you want to be avoiding this so those
are some of the common pitfalls we see
in relying on scaling approaches and the
answer to dealing with these problems
really is to adopt a responsive mobile
design to respond to the devices and
characteristics so here are three
techniques you can use in order to do
this so the first technique is simply
one of combination this is if you have
an extra room combining things from
different screens onto a single screen
in order to make up to fill up the space
so in this example we've got a typical
master detail view which on a phone
would be on two separate screens so
clicking through from a list item for
example might show subsequent details on
the larger device with sufficient width
we might show both of these things at
once and this will avoid the problem of
having those excessive light links and
make better use of the screen real
estate the second technique is one that
we call macro reflow so this is taking
the major building blocks of your
application and reflowing them or
rearranging them on the screen in order
to make better use of the space so in
this example we've simply moved
something like a large header image and
a body text instead of being vertically
stacked above each other to be
horizontally stacked next to each other
so give the image more space to kind of
them to show off on the the larger
amounts of screen real estate as well as
avoiding this excessive line lengths and
when it's in a landscape device so this
is not only useful for different size
devices you can also use this kind of
trick when changing on the same device
between different orientations and the
last technique I want to go through is
something we call micro reflow so this
technique really focuses on the
individual blocks within your design and
it delegates responsibilities to those
individual blocks to optimize themselves
given a certain amount of space so a
couple of examples of doing that on
there on the left here we have a list
type application which given sufficient
space might lead to those excessive line
lengths or very unbalanced views
so instead of that each individual list
item knows that given a certain amount
of space how to draw itself so once it
gets over a certain size a certain
amount of width available to the device
and it will change its representation
instead of being a list item like change
to say a grip grid representation so
this will allow you to have a you know
fill the space better the second example
is if you you can't kind of visit it is
simply no way to introduce more content
you can introduce a margin point instead
so in this form type application on the
right when we go beyond the phone and
past a certain size when there just
isn't any more content we can show on
screen we simply introduce a margin
point so it doesn't end up being
excessively long or excessively
unbalanced so Nick just talked to us
about some really awesome UI techniques
for small screens but so the small
screen affects a lot more than just a UI
it actually really affects the UX of
your app yeah simply taking a web or
desktop app and shrinking it down so it
fits into a small screen is probably not
the way to go
you really need to think mobile first
and optimize your flow for the
smartphone so how do we do this while
you're framing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
