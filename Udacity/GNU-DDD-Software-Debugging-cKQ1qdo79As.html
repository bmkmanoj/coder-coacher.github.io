tool that would take a program and
visualize this in various graphical
forms it will produce correctly
formatted text flow charts or NASA
Schneiderman diagrams and you'd even be
able to edit these in an editor later I
went on pursuing my PhD which I
completed in 1997 on a topic named
configuration management with feature
logic the idea was to use the scripting
logic to model changes in variants and
to detect inconsistencies this was
pretty cool but the problem was that
apparently no developer was willing to
learn description logics plus
configuration management was essentially
solved so was disappointed that's when a
student of mine no hotel Utica house
came along and we developed the idea to
use my old library for visualizing
programs to visualize data structures
rather than programs finally I would be
doing something useful the resulting to
became a debugger named EDD for data
display debugger this is what did he
look like he command-line interface so
you could enter arbitrary commands you'd
also see the source code you would be
able to set breakpoints and see the
current execution position the
interesting thing however about DDD as
the name says data display debugger was
the ability to show data structures
furnaces up here we have visualized that
pointer list and now I can double click
on the pointer to see where it points to
this is the element the pointer points
to I can check out what self points to
obviously points to itself I can look up
the next value again look up self and
again look up the next value and see
that the whole thing becomes actually a
linked list needless to say as I keep on
stair
I think through the program and as the
values change the display would be
updated automatically just as well
DDD eventually became free software and
was even adopted by the GNU project so
it became new DDD and it became very
popular with C and C++ programmers today
there's even Python support built into
DDD but I'm not maintaining this anymore
so I don't know how well this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
