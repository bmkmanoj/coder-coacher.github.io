applet and you've seen how the sampling
distribution changes when we have larger
sample sizes but try one more applet
this time we have an actual population
distribution rather than just the values
1 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 like we did with the dice
so this time you can start with a parent
population being normally distributed or
you could start with the uniform
distribution for the population or
skewed or custom you could draw a
bimodal distribution and then you can
simulate taking for example five values
from this population finding the mean
and graphing it so i clicked animated
here and it found five random values
from this population and then plotted
the sample mean let's do that same thing
1000 times so here's the distribution of
sample means and you can even calculate
the standard deviation of this
distribution because here we have the
population parameters so the standard
deviation of this distribution should be
7.88 the population standard deviation
divided by the square root of 5 try it
out do you get 3.5 for you probably get
something pretty close and that might be
because this standard deviation is
treating this as a sample so it's using
Bessel's correction that means that this
standard deviation would be slightly
bigger than if we were calculating it
treating this as a population but that's
besides the point play around with this
this will really help you get to know
sampling distributions and we're going
to use sampling distributions throughout
the rest of the course the important
thing to take away here is that you can
have any population of any shape and
then if you plot the distribution of
sample means you'll get a normal
distribution and it'll be more and more
normal as n increases remember though if
n is
one then the distribution of means is
just going to look like the population
distribution we don't just need to use
computer applets to demonstrate the
central limit theorem we can use real
materials to professor's laraway and
rogers prepared the following example
