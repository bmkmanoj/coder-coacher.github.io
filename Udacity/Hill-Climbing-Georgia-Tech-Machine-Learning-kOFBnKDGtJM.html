probably either already know about or
would be able to come up with rather
quickly which is the idea of hill
climbing so if this is the function that
we're trying to find the maximum of then
one thing we could do is imagine just
guessing some X I don't know say this
one which has some particular f of X
value and then to say okay well let's
move around in a neighborhood around
that point and see where we can go that
would actually improve the function
value so we here the neighborhood might
be you know a little to the left a
little bit to the right on the x axis
and what we find is that one direction
it's going down the other direction is
going up so what hill climbing says is
find the neighbor that has the largest
function value this is steepest ascent
hill climbing and if that neighbor is
above where we are now has a higher
function value than we are now then move
to that point
otherwise we stop because we're at a
local optimum so what this is going to
do is it's going to iterate moving up
and up and up and up this curve always
in a better and better and better
direction until it hits this peak here
then it's going to look on both sides of
it the neighborhood everything in the
neighborhood is worse so it just stops
there and this is the X that it returned
which is you know not a bad answer it's
not the best answer but it's a good
answer hmm what if you had started out
just a little bit more to the left see
on the other side of that a valley
Oh like here yeah hmm so then well let's
see what would what would it do we start
there we take a step we say what's the
neighborhood the neighborhood are the
points just a little bit to the left
just a little bit to the right one of
them is an improvement so it takes the
improvement and again it keeps finding
it more and more improved and then it
gets this top of this little bump and it
says okay both the points in my
neighborhood are worse than where I am
now
hurray I'm done hmm so that's not even
the worst of the local optima it could
actually get stuck here as well which is
even lower well I could smoke anywhere
well in any peak yes exactly right and
that's the lowest of the peaks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
