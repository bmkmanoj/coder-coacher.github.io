this point in this lesson we're going to
work with a collection of tweets now I
need to make clear that since this is a
collection that was gathered some time
ago it does not reflect the state of
Twitter feeds as they look right now
it's a small snapshot in time
so our tweets have the following form so
you can see that there is a unique
identifier there will be text for the
tweet itself and then an entity's field
now the entities field is broken down
into user mentions URLs and hashtags and
we actually took a look at one tweet in
the last lesson so this should be at
least partially familiar to you the user
mentions URLs and hashtags represent
that type of data and where it's found
in the text of a tweet it's been
extracted for us and stored in these
individual fields okay and then with
each tweet there's information about the
user at the time the tweet was made as
you will see our tweet documents
actually contain many more fields we're
representing those by the ellipse as you
see in this example as with the other
datasets we've considered this type of
data is representative of what you might
work with as a data scientist many data
scientists are employed in spaces that
work heavily with social media Google
Facebook and Twitter are some of the
most prominent of thousands of firms
actually that employed people to analyze
this type of data now just for a moment
imagine the types of analysis we might
want to do on tweets common for this
type of data is to understand the
behavior of users and the networks
involved there are lots of ways we can
do that now one of the most powerful
things about putting our data in a
database is that most databases provide
some analytics tools built-in that
enable us to explore our data a bit and
get a sense for the story to tells in
MongoDB the built in analytics tools
take the form of what we call the
aggregation framework while not a
replacement for MapReduce in a lot of
situations it does provide a powerful
tool for exploring our data and
exploring it whether we're auditing
the quality of our data or doing some
analysis and with each major release of
MongoDB this becomes a more powerful
tool there are several really valuable
feature enhancements actually in the 2.6
release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
