angular component directives now we've
looked at a couple of them already ng
app to bootstrap the entire application
ng controller has a controller and scope
to an element an ng include which
fetches compiles and includes an
external HTML template directives are
fun to work with and as we've seen with
these directives they can be very
powerful but what is a directive exactly
angularjs is documentation says that
directives are markers on a Dom element
that tell angular's HTML compiler to
attach a specified behavior to that Dom
element or even transform that Dom
element and it's children so a directive
is something you place on an element to
tell angular to do something we've
already used ng app and ng-controller
but angular provides a ton of other
directives there's ng-show ng class ng
model ng repeat ng source and ng-click
just to name a few to see a complete
list of directives check out the link in
the instructor notes the ng if directive
is simple but very powerful it either
creates or removes an element based on
the validity of its expression in our
template we display the rating here if
the rating for a menu item is higher
than 4 then this expression is true and
we see this text so if I change the
rating down here to 4.3 then everybody
will know that strawberry pudding is
fantastic ng class is a very cool
directive it can accept several input
types but I'm passing an object with the
key of warning and a string value if the
menus rating is greater than 4.5 then
the highlight class will be applied to
the element if i set the rating to 4.6
then the text will have the highlight
class you can also combine multiple
directives on one element both of these
directives are on the element but only
one of them is being applied since the
rating is 4.3 another directive that
you've actually used before is ng model
this directive is applied to input
select and text area elements to see
this in action let's add a new section
for reviews here's the text area where a
customer will write a review down here
is where the info will appear we're
using ng if to display some text while
the review box is empty typing
something in the text box will create a
new property on the menu object in the
scope ng model has a lot of moving parts
to it and can do a lot so definitely
check out its documentation linked in
the instructor notes this next directive
ng-repeat is incredibly useful if you
need to loop over items in an array I've
updated the single menu item in the
controller to an array of menu item
objects back in the template we can now
loop over this list of items using
ng-repeat when angular compiles the HTML
template it will loop over this section
once for every menu item it will also
apply a new scope object for each one
every time we loop through the list will
reference the menu item as just item
since we're using item instead of menu
now we need to update our expressions
and there we go just this little bit of
template code is used to make this
dynamic view how awesome is that let's
now transition this image from text to
the actual image file we'll do it with
another directive because angular
expressions are compiled after the HTML
is downloaded in parsed by the browser
just sticking an expression in here
would make the browser look for an image
at this path the ng source directive
waits to add an image until after the
compilation step and here are our images
ng if class source and repeat all work
with existing data to actually interact
with a nap we use the ng-click directive
let's add a couple of new buttons for
changing the rating ng-click for this
button will call increment passing it
the current menu item this button will
decrease the rating here are the
functions that get called i'm using this
crazy calculation instead of this one
because javascript doesn't handle
mathematical calculations with decimal
numbers like we expect increasing a
rating will add a tenth of a point while
decreasing it will remove it what's
really cool is that all of the
directives work together perfectly if we
increment this item over 4 then the
message appears over 4.5 and the class
gets added I just love directives and
they make building powerful apps
effortless
we've only looked at a handful of
directives so make sure you know all the
ones that angular ships with and how
they're used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
