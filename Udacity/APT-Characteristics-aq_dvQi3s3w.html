those that use and zero-day exploit or
especially crafted malware a zero-day
attack exploits a previously unknown
vulnerability and therefore there is no
patch or fix for the vulnerable system
and most likely there's no prevention or
detection signature for the attack that
is a zoo they exploit we will succeed
and go undetected likewise especially
crafted malware is usually designed to
defeat the signatures and behavior
patterns in a detection system that is
it also has a very high chance to
succeed and go undetected apts are
catalyzed by its ability to not only
evade anti-malware and network intrusion
detection systems but also full even the
most sophisticated users for example an
apt can be designed to first compromise
an internal network router or server and
all it does at that point is to learn
about the valuable individuals that is
the apt will first learn who's emailing
to whom on what topic and with what kind
of attachments in the email with such
knowledge the apt can then Forge email
from a person to another and this email
can appear to be very legitimate this is
so-called spearfishing because it is
targeted to a specific individual and if
the internal network router or server
has been compromised the apt can play
man in the middle to make such social
engineering attacks very successful and
very convincing for example if the email
recipient is not certain about the email
attachment and he sends an email to the
sender and asking hey do you send this
the apt campaign men in the middle to
intercept such inquiry and send answer
back to the user to say yes I send us
apts are also designed to plan in with
normal activities to avoid detection
even if that means he has to go low and
slow for example if an apt is designed
to forge a document it will not do so
unless the user is also authoring
another document similarly if the apt is
designed to send our document it will
not do so unless the users also sending
our document as another example if the
apt is designed to change this
setting of a controller in a nuclear
plant the apt does not make the changes
or at once instead it will make
incremental small changes over time to
accomplish the eventual attack goal for
example the famous Stuxnet falls into
this example and you can search and
learn more about it and because apt
activities are designed to plan in with
normal activities and go low and slow it
is very hard for an anomaly detection
system to catch an apt apts are often
designed to stay in the compromised
organization for a long time for example
always looking for more valuable data to
steal for example an apt can include a
number of steps and at each step you
only focus on a subset of the users and
only part of the network and at each
step he may actually use a different
version of the malware and when it moves
from one part of the network to another
he may clean itself from the 0 part that
is an any given time it's only present
at the specific target in other words
its footprint remains to be very small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
