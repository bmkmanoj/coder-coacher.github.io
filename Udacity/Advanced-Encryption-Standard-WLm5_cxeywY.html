encryption algorithm the advanced
encryption standard or AES recall that a
major shortcoming of DES is that the key
length is only 56 bit and that is
considered to be short in other words
the key space is relatively small an
attacker can use brute force to find the
key using the power of today's computers
of course we can use two pas des to
increase the key length but that would
mean running deaths three times and
that's not the most efficient way of
doing encryption therefore there was a
need for new encryption algorithm that
can take longer key lengths but also be
efficient so in 1997 nist
put our public call for new encryption
standard to replace des after four
rounds of submissions and reviews AES
was finalized and it became a new
standard replacing des like des AES is
also a block cipher well as in des the
input plaintext block is 64 bit in AES
it is 128 bit in DES the key length is
only if it is expend in AES it can be
128 192 or 256 bits these killings are
considered long enough to defeat put
force attempt to search for a key
here is a high-level view of AES the
encryption process is as follows
again the plaintext block is represented
as a square matrix we call it a state
array and we first XOR with a key again
the key is also represented as a square
matrix then the stay array go through
multiple rounds of encryption at each
round it goes through several operations
that represent substitution and
permutation and also the param key is
XOR to this day array the operations at
each round include subsidy to buy
this involves using a table referred to
as an sbox to performed by two byte
substitution of the block shift Rose is
a simple permutation that is performed
row by row mixed columns is a
substitution there alters each byte in a
column as a function of all the bytes in
the column and then the result is exhort
with a parent I D operations of the last
round in cruz substituted bytes shift
rows and add parent key and the result
is the cipher text in AES the decryption
process runs the algorithm in the
reverse direction this means that each
of these operations must be reversible
let's take a look now adding ronke
involves the XOR operation and the XOR
operation by itself is reversible the
other operations meaning substitute
bytes shift rows and mixed columns an
inverse function is used in a decryption
algorithm by using this inverse function
we can reverse the action of substitute
bytes that was performed in encryption
likewise we can reverse the effects of
shift roads and mixed columns in the
decryption process therefore each of the
operations are reversible as a result
when we run the algorithm in the reverse
order we can decrypt the cipher text
back into the plaintext</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
