assumption that simple operations take
only one time step is rather unrealistic
because in a real computer you have lots
of differences between simple operations
and also loops such as ifs and whiles
can take very different amounts of time
depending on where and when they are
executed the second one we have as much
memory as we need that might be
debatable for some cases given that
memory is actually not that expensive
anymore but there's still lots of
problems where you can run out of memory
and so that is still a real issue so I
would also say this is rather
unrealistic memory access being free in
terms of times that is very unrealistic
because in a real computer you really
have to watch out what kind of memory
you're using so for example if you're
using registers and a processor that is
memory that almost comes for free that's
very fast but when you have to read and
write to your hard disk that is going to
take very long so memory access being
free is really unrealistic finally a
unit of memory not being able to hold an
arbitrarily large number that is very
realistic because your computer
depending on how many bits each unit of
memory can hold if it's 30 32 or 64 and
there's always a limit of how much you
can store in the single unit of memory
and then you have to go to the next one
so given that there's lots of
unrealistic aspects for the RAM why are
we using it in this course well there's
basically two reasons the first reason
is that it's a very simple model to use
so if we had to consider all of those
aspects as well our analysis would get
even more complicated than in the simple
example and the second thing is that
when we are running or analyzing
algorithms on the RAM the general
behavior of the algorithm how it behaves
on various inputs and how the running
time changes with various types of
inputs still is rather realistic even
though we're not really taking into
account these aspects so when you have
to implement an algorithm which is
something that we're not doing in this
course then of course you have to take
care of these things and see for example
if the types of operations you're using
is making your algorithm run faster or
slower or if you need to take care of
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
