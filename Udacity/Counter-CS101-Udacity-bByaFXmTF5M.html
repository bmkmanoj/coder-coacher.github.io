meaning that speakers of the language
will understand we could define words as
just what's in the dictionary and then
there would be a clear answer for that
but certainly there are lots of things
that are words that aren't in the
dictionary and the important thing about
words is we have rules for making new
words for example we have a rule that
says if we have a word we can make a new
word by adding counter in front of the
old ward I'm using the same notation
that we used back in unit 1 this is the
BNF replacement grammar if you need a
refresher on this please go back to the
video that introduced that in unit 1 but
the basic property is that we can
replace what's on the left side with
what's on the right side so anytime we
have a word we can replace it with
counter word and the meaning of the new
word is something that goes against the
original word so if we started with the
word intelligence and I mean this in the
sense of spycraft not in terms of smarts
well then we can use the rule we could
make the word counter intelligence
intelligence was a word we added counter
in front of it to make
counterintelligence and that means
trying to thwart intelligence from the
enemy we can use the rule again so now
this is a word and we could replace this
word with counter in front of that word
and we get counter counter intelligence
and that would be trying to thwart the
enemy's counterintelligence that's
preventing you from getting intelligence
and we could keep doing that we could
have counter counter counter
intelligence and so forth and these are
words that once we get up to at least
three counters it's not something that's
used before but it's still something
that has a sensible meeting and we could
do this further words so we saw that one
of the very long words was this hippo
paw Thomas monstrous to psycho follow
phobia and if you knew that this word
meant fear of long words and even if
you've never seen the word counter in
front of that before so now we can make
the new word counter hippo
pato monstrously paid a lil phobia quite
a mouthful but even though you've never
seen that word before and I expect most
of you have never seen that word before
well you could guess that this is
something that goes against the fear of
long words maybe there's some new
medication that cures people of this
phobia and you could also figure out
well if there was a counter counter
hippo and so forth phobia well that
would be something that counteracts the
counter hippo and that might be
something where this new drug doesn't
work if you have too much coffee then
coffee would be a counter counter hippo
so forth phobia so the point is because
English has this rule that allows us to
make new words from old words there's no
such thing as the longest word we can
always make a longer word starting from
any word that we have if you remember
how BNF grammars work then you should be
able to answer the next quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
