when our losses was encoded by position
Y or orientation scoring margin was
encoded by position wire length World
Cup winners were indicated by a shape
and time was encoded by position X let's
see these on the graphic we can see that
the country is encoded by the color of
the bars or really each country has its
own panel of data so Germany would be
read Brazil would be green Argentina
blue and the Netherlands orange each of
these bars represents an individual game
and the scoring margin for that game so
whether or not a game was a winner loss
depends on the Y position or the
orientation of the bar bars that point
upwards indicate wins for Germany all
the bars that point downward indicate
losses for Germany the actual scoring
margin for each game is the length of
the bar in this case it looks like about
positive 3 we also accepted position Y
since the scoring margin could be
positive upward or downward negative
time is encoded horizontally along the
x-axis for each of our small multiples
and then finally whether or not a
country was a World Cup winner is
encoded by shape or a star which we see
for Germany in 1954 1974 and 1990 now I
think this visualization is quite
successful and what's incredible is that
there's even more going on in it such as
the annotations that you see here and
the alternation between this white and
light tan background encoding the years
if you find other things that you like
about this visualization share it on the
discussion threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
