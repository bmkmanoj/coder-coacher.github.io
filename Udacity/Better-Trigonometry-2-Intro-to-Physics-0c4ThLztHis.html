by using either a calculator or a
computer and in fact we can go the other
way so what if I told you I have an
angle and the tangent of that angle is
0.93 - so maybe a way to write that
would be tangent of some angle I don't
know what it's equal to 0.93 - well
you've had some practice in this you
could go to your table look up tangent
0.93 - and see at the angle we're
talking about is 43 degrees what we're
doing here is sort of the opposite of
computing a tangent instead of looking
at an angle and calculating the tangent
we're looking at the tangent and
calculating the angle so what we're
doing is the inverse tangent it's the
exact opposite of taking a tangent the
way we specify this inverse tangent as
we say arc tan or sometimes ten to the
negative one I'll be using arc tan for
now so if you went into Google right now
and you typed arc tangent or arc tan of
0.93 - remember this is exactly the same
step as looking up into the trig table
there is an angle whose tangent is 0.93
- arc tan we'll find that out so if we
enter this into Google our ten of 0.93 -
what we'll get is the following answer
zero point seven five something
something something radians now this is
strange this is a unit you may have
never seen before or maybe you have but
this is just another way of measuring
angles the radiant it's another unit
just like the stadium is another unit of
distance now this is a fine measure
radians is a wonderful unit but it's not
the unit we want so actually Google will
allow you to specify the unit you want
I'd like you to go to google and type in
arc tan 0.93 - in degrees this will tell
Google hey I want the answer in degree
is not radiance and entering the result
you get here I just go to two decimal
places should be fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
