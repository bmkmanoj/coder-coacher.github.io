three if you thought that the health
situation is started to look grim and
the last problem we dealt with waning
immunity this time circumstances have
become even more dire there's no
immunity at all instead of the typical
SAR model people simply switch back and
forth between susceptible and infected
we're assuming that no people are lost
in this scenario so that means that the
total number of people which i'm going
to call n stays constant since every
person is either in the S group or the I
group we know that at any given moment s
plus i equals in here once again are the
standard SAR model equations you'll need
to change these to reflect the new
situation similar to what you had to do
in the last problem start by reducing
this system of differential equations to
a single equation that contains only I
and n but not s then solve this equation
numerically using the trapezoidal method
which in case you forgot i will show you
right now remember that the trapezoidal
rule finds the value of a quantity after
an additional time step by taking the
original quantity and adding to it h
times the average of its rate of change
at the two points in consideration now
use notation here that probably makes
sense but just to be clear X sub n is
just equal to X measured at the nth time
step and x dot n is just equal to the
time derivative of X at the end time
step now once you go through using the
trapezoidal method I want you to solve
for us and they convert your equations
for I and us into Python right now the
supplied code contains expressions for s
and I that come from the forward Euler
method before you fill in the program
with a trapezoidal rule run it as it is
right now try it first with H set to 10
as it is here and see what happens then
change h 2 equal point 5 or in the
program and compare the difference
between the plots when you've changed
the code as we've asked you to see how
each of these step sizes works with the
trapezoidal method instead after you're
done with everything set H to 10 and
press submit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
