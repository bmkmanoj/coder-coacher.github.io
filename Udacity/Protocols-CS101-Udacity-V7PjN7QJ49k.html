is a protocol and what a protocol is the
set of rules that people agree to that
tell you how to entities can talk to
each other so for the web the protocol
gives rules about how a client and a
server talk to each other the client is
the web browser and the server is the
web server so that might be udacity.com
the web browser is what you're running
at home and what the protocol says is if
you want to get the server to do
something the client has to send a
message in a particular way the protocol
that we use on the web is called
hypertext Transfer Protocol which is
abbreviated as HTTP when you look in
your browser almost all the URLs that
you use start with HTTP that indicates
that the protocol that you should use to
talk to the server that you're
requesting a document from is this
protocol called hypertext Transfer
Protocol and it's a very simple protocol
there aren't too many messages there's
actually only two main messages and
there's only one we'll talk about that's
the message called get the client can
send a message to the server where the
message says get and then the name of
the object that you want to get so
that's all the client does it sends the
message like this and if you remember
the Python code forget page well it's
calling some library function that
actually does this it's sending the get
message to the server the server will
get that message it will do some run
some code on it it will find a file that
was requested it might run some more
code to get the result take the web
application course to understand more
about what the server does but what
matters to the client and what matters
to us and using this is what happens
after that the server sends back a
response which is the contents of the
requested object so that's the whole
protocol that's what's going on whether
you send a web request using your
browser by clicking on a link well then
the browser's doing a lot of things to
figure out what you requested and then
it's sending a get message to the right
web server that was the server specified
by the URL to know which server it is
and then it's getting a response and
it's doing processing on that response
to render it
if you want to understand more about
what the web browser is doing take the
programming languages class that focuses
on how to build a web browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
