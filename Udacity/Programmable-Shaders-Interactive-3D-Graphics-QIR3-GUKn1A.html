with a vertex shader and a fragment
shader
once upon a time both these stages were
not programmable they were handled by
what was called the fixed function
pipeline transistors in the GPU were
specifically dedicated to the transform
and rasterization processes the
programmer basically set a bunch of
switches and values that control the
flow of data however there's no real
program ability involved the Nintendo
Wii was about the last to use this type
of architecture in 2002 GPUs started to
appear that included vertex and fragment
shaders a shader is truly a programmable
piece of the pipeline in other words you
actually send little or sometimes large
shader programs to each of these units
these programs are written in a C like
language if you know what C or C++ looks
like up to this point we've been having
three J s do the programming for us when
we create a material three GS actually
creates two small programs one each for
the vertex and fragment shaders when the
object with that material is to be
displayed these shaders are loaded with
their programs the triangles are then
sent down the pipeline and the programs
are executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
