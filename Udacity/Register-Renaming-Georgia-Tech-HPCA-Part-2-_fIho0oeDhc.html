all the register values that have ever
been produced is a problem so we will
look at register renaming which is
another scheme that can provide relief
from false dependencies but in a way
that actually is more manageable how
does the register renaming work so
register renaming separates the concept
of architectural registers which are the
registers that the programmers and the
compilers use so this is when you write
an instruction like add R 1 R 2 R 3 the
R 1 R 2 and R 3 that you are referring
to are the architectural registers in
register renaming there is also a
concept of physical registers which is
all the places that we can actually put
a value in the processor so there is of
course a place for kind of the latest
value of R 1 for example but there could
be additional places where we could
potentially store values that should be
going to R 1 and then what we do is as
the processor reads instructions and
figures out which registers they are
using and remember the program is
referring to architecture registers as
it's fetching instructions and decoding
them it also does register renaming
which pretty much means that it rewrites
the program to use the physical
registers so basically if it sees add r1
r2 r3 it's going to rename that into you
know add R something else and so on in
order to basically refer to the places
where it has actually put those values
and how does it know where the values
are well it uses a table called the
register allocation table or rat and you
should remember this because we will be
very frequently referring to the rat
because it's used very very often what
the rat is is a table that says which
physical registers has the value for
which architectural register so for each
of the architectural registers there
will be an entry in this table and it
will say what is the current location in
the physical registers where the value
for that architectural registers can be
found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
