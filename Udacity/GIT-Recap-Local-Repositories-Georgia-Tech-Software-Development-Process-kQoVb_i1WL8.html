operations that we can perform on local
repositories I'm just gonna list them
here and go through them by separating
them into three main categories the
first one is commands to create a
repository and notice that not all of
these are good commands that for example
to create a repository we normally want
to create a directory which is exactly
what we did in our demo we want to go to
that directory and then execute the git
init statement which initializes that
directory as a git repository
the second category includes commands
that they will use to modify the content
of the repository we saw that we can use
git add to add a specific file or a
complete directory to our index so to
the list of files that will be committed
that will be considered in the next
commit then we can use commit to
actually commit the changes that we made
to those files to our locker repository
and we can also use git move and get RM
or git remove to move files around and
to remove files finally the third
category is the category of commands
that we can use to inspect the concrete
of the repository and this set includes
git log then we can use to see the log
of the repository git status that can
give us important information about the
status of the files in the repository
git diff that we can use to see the
differences between for example our
local files and the remote files and
finally get show that will show us
information about our last commit what
we committed what were the changes and
so on and again we saw most or all of
these commands that in our demo so let
me also remind you of a possible
workflow which again we already saw but
it's always good to go through it once
more and remember that this is just an
example it's just a possible workflow
you can do many different things you can
have many different workflows with get
this is just that to illustrate some of
the things that you can do so you might
do some local editing execute git status
to see what files you changed and you
might run a git diff on the files to see
what are these changes and then you can
run git commit - a - commit your changes
and in case you want to specify the
commit message right away without having
to go through an editor you can also add
the - M parameter and specify the
message here on the same line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
