you give some examples of how Bacchus
noir form is used in practice
for example being a formal way to
describe a language it seems that BNF
might find some use in creating
compilers or interpreters or other tasks
involving teaching a computer to
understand text also BNF lets you go
from the abstract form to the concrete
form but it seems like in practice
you'd more often want to go in the
opposite direction for example given a
concrete example of a Python statement
you'd want to know how the interpreter
passes it so Dave how would you do this
thanks for the question Tracy that's a
great question we're using BNF in this
class to understand languages to see how
we can construct the expressions in
Python
what grammars are also used by the
interpreter to break the strings that we
put in into their parts so when you
write a Python program and you run that
in the interpreter the interpreter has
to figure out what the things are it has
to figure out is this an assignment
expression is it a variable are these
parts of a number is it a string all the
things that we've seen in unit one and
in later units are constructs in Python
and we need the grammar that's built
into the interpreter to break that
string into its parts so that is part of
what's implemented and when people
implement interpreters or compilers they
usually do it by starting by writing a
grammar and then there's a tool that
takes that grammar and turns in a
program that will break the string down
into its pieces and if you take the
follow-on course to this if you take the
CS 262 programming languages course that
tells a lot more about how interpreters
actually do that there are lots of other
uses of grammars besides just breaking
down programming languages into pieces
and some are in the generative sense
where you start from the grammar and
produce strings an interesting example
of that is guessing passwords there was
a group of Florida State that looked at
how to create passwords first you learn
a grammar from a set of passwords you
might have and then you can create more
passwords and you can use this as a way
of guessing passwords or if you want to
measure how strong a password is to
estimate how hard it would be to produce
that
berg from this grammar there are lots of
interesting uses of grammars to produce
strings the more common use in
programming languages is where we use
the grammar to break an input which is
all one long string of text that's your
Python program to turn that into the
components of that program using a
grammar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
