real world it is usually used to mean
the feel of cloth or perhaps the
roughness of a material in computer
graphics the word texture refers to any
pattern or image applied to a surface to
change its color shininess or just about
any other part of its appearance in one
sense adding a texture to a surface is
another form of modeling you're
specifying the color or roughness or
reflectivity of the object based on its
surface location the most popular way to
add a texture to a surface is to use
images any 2d image can be applied to a
surface in these lessons will delve into
how these images are attached to objects
and the various ways to control their
display another important use for
textures is to act as surrounding
environments while it can be expensive
to attempt to have objects reflect other
objects in a scene it turns out to be
extremely fast to reflect textures
representing a whole environment there
are some limitations but surfaces can be
made to look much more realistic and
visually rich by this simple addition
even an approximation of refraction can
be done with this type of technique in
this unit I'll provide you with the
basics of how various forms of texturing
works also be taking you on a tour of
some of the major effects achievable
with textures I won't be explaining all
of these in detail the good news is that
code for almost all the dentals you'll
see are part of three j/s this gives you
the ability to easily prod and poke at
these various effects and see what makes
them tick I strongly encourage you to do
so I did this myself in creating some of
these lessons and it was a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
