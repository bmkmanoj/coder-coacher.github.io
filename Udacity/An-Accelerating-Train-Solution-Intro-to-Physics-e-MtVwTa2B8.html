appeared move backwards now this was a
tricky one but you can verify it for
yourself if you drive or if you know
someone who does get in the car take an
apple and wait at a red light once that
light turns green accelerate forwards
and drop the Apple you'll see that it
actually appears to land behind where
you release the Apple from so when we
accelerate this way the Apple appears to
move backwards when we accelerate that
way likewise the Apple moves backwards
of course if you're gonna do this make
sure you're safe about it and make sure
your car has wheels what's really
interesting about what we found here is
that acceleration seems to be somehow
important objects at rest behave in the
same way as objects moving in constant
speed but acceleration is important
things no longer behave the same one
what we call our reference frame starts
accelerating we also saw that
acceleration was somehow special when we
looked at Galileo who found that all
objects fall at a constant acceleration
clearly acceleration is a very important
quantity and by the end of today you
will understand it very deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
