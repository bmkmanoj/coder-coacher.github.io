things that we think should be private
we should be able to exercise control
over who can learn about them and who
can use that information but the other
things that are clearly not not private
for example where I live my address you
buy a house or some it's recorded the
deed is recorded and by your local
government or whoever and you know
anyone can go see that book where that's
done am I register to vote and the US
this information is public its you don't
have the right to to say well it
shouldn't be collected or shared with
anyone else and some more surprising
things may not be probably I as a
professor Georgia Tech which is a public
university my salary is is public
because the state of Georgia said
actually this is the good point the
context is is extremely important as
well so we talked about communication
emails well as employees of the state of
Georgia we subject to Georgia Tech it
subject to the public university subject
to open records requests the other side
of privacy we're going to see is your
village to access information so privacy
limits it so there's certainly sort of
trade off and what you and I view as
private some things are clearly private
versus non private but obviously in
other cases we may have different
opinions and and those opinions may have
informed by who we are our cultural
backgrounds and things like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
