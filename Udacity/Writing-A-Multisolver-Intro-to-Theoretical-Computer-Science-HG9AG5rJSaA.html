something similar to what we've done in
a previous homework where you are given
a magic function to use for a reduction
so you're provided with a function solve
VC which solves vertex cover for a given
graph represented as an adjacency matrix
as we've seen previously now it returns
a minimum cover of the graph as a list
of zeros and ones where one means the
corresponding vertex is in the cover and
zero means that it is not now what you
should do here is use solve VC to write
a function multi solve which takes as
its inputs and adjacency matrix and a
string the adjacency matrix is simply a
graph and the string is either vertex
cover independent set or click and it
returns a list of zeros and ones which
are assignments of the vertices where
one means the corresponding vertex is in
the solution to the corresponding
problem and zero means that it is not
now you can feel free to use any
additional functions you might feel are
necessary but to be graded correctly you
have to use solve EC in the solution to
your problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
