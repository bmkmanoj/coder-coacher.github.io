want to arrange my ten sticks of gum
with one pack per column so if I bought
two packs of gum with five six each I
would have two columns and each column
will have five sticks of gum so I can
just rearrange that a little bit and
it'll look like this I now have two
columns of gum one column for each pack
and five rows of gum so five pieces in
each pack to find the total number of
sticks of gum i can multiply the number
of packs of gum which is to buy the
number of sticks per pack which is five
and that gives 10 so if 10 sticks of gum
but if i had instead bought five packs
of gum with 26 each i would have five
columns and each column would have two
sticks of gum that would look like this
see five columns one for each pack and
two rows one for each piece I still have
10 pieces of gum they're just arranged
differently these two arrangements are
equivalent we've just reversed the rows
and the columns switching the order of
the rows and the columns does not change
the results this is the main
characteristic of the commutative
property the commutative property states
that changing the order of the terms
does not change the outcome of the
operation so which operations follow the
commutative property addition
subtraction multiplication division
please select all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
