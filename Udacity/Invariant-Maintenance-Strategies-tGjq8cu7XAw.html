the analysis and design is how we are
going to maintain these invariants what
maintains means is how once the
invariant is broken you will propagate
the knowledge of the break to the
appropriate components so they can take
steps to reestablish the invariant we
can call these invariant maintenance
strategies or you can just say how are
you going to implement this and in
particular we're going to have examples
of three invariant maintenance
strategies the first one is aggregated
responsibilities that is a single
component is going to be responsible for
managing this process even if it has to
invoke or make use of several other
components that single components
responsible for handling the external
events and for delegating the invariant
maintenance to the appropriate
subordinate components that's strategy
one strategy to is the opposite
distributed responsibility each
component knows about the dependent
components in anything that is
responsible for managing and invokes
them when it's state changes and the
third variant main is strategy which is
called the mediated responsibility or
mediated strategy okay it involves a
special implementation element called a
mediator and it's provided was one
mediator for each invariant the mediator
knows all okay it knows about the both
the independent and dependent
participants in the invariant the
independent one is the one that gets
informed when the initial event takes
place and the dependent ones are the
ones that have to respond to it three
strategies aggregated in one place
distributed or a new component a
mediator responsible for dealing with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
