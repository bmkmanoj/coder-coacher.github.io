what we know n is any positive integer
and I is zero well we do know that I is
less than n because 0 is less than any
positive integer and this loop runs
while I is less than equal to n and
every iteration I increases by 1 we know
intuitively that eventually I will
become greater than n because n is fixed
so we can say definitively that this
loop always finishes like the previous
loop let's look at what we have we have
a positive integer n I which starts at 1
and here a while true loop it will
continue forever until we trigger the
break so let's look at the inside I at
every iteration doubles an N at every
iteration increases by 1 and the point
in which we break is when I becomes
greater than n one way to think about I
is that it's an exponential function
every iteration it doubles in size n is
linear every iteration increases by 1 so
we know I starts at 1 but every time it
doubles and however it can start at any
positive integer it can be anywhere on
here but we do know that it increases
very slowly in fact it's guaranteed that
eventually I will profess n I'll leave
the mathematical proof to you but you
can take my word for it for now
considering all that eventually I is
going to be greater than n we know that
we will eventually break which proves
that loop to always finishes so let's
look at this last loop it's pretty
simple code we're given an integer n
which is any positive integer and while
that that integer is not equal to 1 if
it's even we divide by 2
otherwise we multiply by 3 and add 1
this is pretty simple however in order
to figure out whether this loop
terminates you have to solve an open
mathematical problem you have to
determine whether or not the Collatz
conjecture is true the Collatz
conjecture states that given any
positive integer n this code will
terminate it's an open mathematical
problem and no one has solved it this is
just an example of why
a really simple loop like this is really
hard to determine whether or not it
terminates as mentioned in the lecture
it's actually impossible for a computer
to solve this problem in general the
correct answer this is unknown to anyone
in the known universe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
