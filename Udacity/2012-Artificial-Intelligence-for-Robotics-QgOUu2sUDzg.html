Google car we're now using multiple
methods to use history methods and
particle methods
the main difference to what you've
learned so far is twofold
the main difference of what learned so
far is the robot model the vehicles
actually model as a system with two non
steerable wheels and two steel wheels
that's often called a bicycle model
because half of it this thing over here
acts like a bicycle the big difference
is the sensor there instead of using
landmarks we give this video laberd word
map and then we take a single snapshot
and we match that snapshot into the map
and the better the match the higher the
score and then on top of if you have
additional sensors like GPS
you also have inertial sensors I'm not
going to go to those at all but the
methods I I taught you are rich enough
to handle these additional sensors so
you've just learned about the gist of
the method in which the Google car is
able to find erson where it is and where
other cars are when you build a system
you have to dive with these more
elaborate methods but I think it's very
much doable it's very easy to replace
the current simple motion model with a
slightly more sophisticated for what's
called a bicycle model and it's easy to
write a correlation function hooks into
map data and computes normalized
correlations of measurement images and a
big pixel map I leave this as an
exercise so if you want to hack your own
car and make a drive itself have fun I
just want to congratulate you you've
actually in these three classes learn
pretty much as much as any of my
Stanford student learns in my
specialized AI classes on robotics when
it comes to reward perception in fact
you've learned pretty much what there is
to know to become a successful
practitioner in robotics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
