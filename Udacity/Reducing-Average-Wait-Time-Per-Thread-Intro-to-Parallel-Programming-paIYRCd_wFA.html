our tiled per element kernel and this
sink threads is the problem remember we
have a thread block of K by K threads
and at the moment k is set to 32 so we
have a thread block of 1024 threads and
if you think about it each thread is
doing very little work it's reading a
single word into shared memory and then
it's waiting around at the barrier until
all the other threads get done with
their job and then it's writing a single
word to memory so most of the threads in
this block are spending most of their
time waiting on the sink threads call
waiting on this barrier for everybody
else to get there and the more threads
in the block the more time on average
they spend waiting so for a simple
kernel like this most threads spend a
large chunk of their lifetime simply
waiting at this barrier until the last
few threads complete the read operations
so what can we do to reduce the average
wait time per thread should we eliminate
the sink threads call should we reduce
the number of threads per thread block
or should we increase the number of
threads per thread block or perhaps
increase the number of thread blocks per
