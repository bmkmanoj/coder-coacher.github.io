looks like this there are client
workstations which are called virtues
and these client workstations are
connected by unsecure Network links to a
local area network and through the local
area network they can access servers s1
s2 s3 and so on and these servers are in
a secure environment or in other words
accessing the servers from a client
workstation uses insecure links but once
inside the boundary of the servers the
servers can talk to one another exchange
information and grab data from the disks
and so on this communication that
happens inside this server environment
is a secure communication that's part of
the reason they've named the server
environment as vice and the client
environment where you're accessing
information from the secure servers as
the virtue workstation and the important
thing to note is the fact that the
clients have to access information from
the server over unsecure links what that
means is that in order to make sure that
information that is sent on the wire to
the servers or received from the servers
to the clients they have to be encrypted
since anyone can sniff the packets that
are flowing on these wires but inside
the Vice the communication that happens
among the servers because it is secure
there is no need for information
encryption the client workstations run
some flavor of UNIX operating system so
inside each client workstation there is
a special process called Venus and this
process which runs on the virtue
workstation is for the purpose of
authentication of the user and for
client caching of files that the user
may fetch from the Vice
servers into the workstation that
they're logging into the user will use
RPC in order to get the files that they
want to work on on the workstation and
this is where Venus comes in Venus is
the one that authenticates a user
walking up to a virtual workstation to
the server and then acting as the
surrogate for the user in fetching the
files that he or she wants to work on
from the file server using RPC and since
I mentioned that the link that is used
to communicate between virtue and vice
is insecure
the RPC has to be a secure RPC in other
words the RPC messages both passing the
parameters and receiving the results is
going to use encryption on the data that
is being sent and received between the
virtue and the Vice file server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
