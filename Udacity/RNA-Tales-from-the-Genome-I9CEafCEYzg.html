incredibly similar they're not exactly
the same while DNA is made of
deoxynucleotides because it's ribose
sugar is missing an oxygen and here the
ribose sugar is this black Pentagon here
RNA is made of nucleotides which I'm
showing in this sort of light blue
Pentagon meaning that it has an extra
oxygen so this is how I'm going to
distinguish them from here on out
whenever we have this kind of structure
here now nucleotides have nitrogenous
bases just like deoxy nucleotides do you
can see the colorful structures and the
DNA and any RNA and long sequences of
these nucleotides can be strung together
one right after another in DNA as well
as RNA but there's one big difference in
the four letter alphabet of nitrogenous
bases between DNA and RNA just making a
few comparisons here I want you to see
if you can answer three questions for me
I want you to look at the strands and
tell me what DNA letter is missing in
RNA I want you to tell me what new RNA
letter appears and I want you to tell me
what letter that new RNA letter might
base pair with go ahead and see if you
can answer those three questions in the
text boxes here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
