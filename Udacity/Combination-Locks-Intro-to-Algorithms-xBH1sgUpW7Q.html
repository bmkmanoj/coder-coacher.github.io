and then I calculated all the other ones
where I couldn't count between the
zeroth in the first element because I'd
already done that and so just one less
um did write down a whole lot from that
because that one was straight for it so
it was less than two in for the
combination thing so it has to be theta
of n okay we're not n minus 1 links to
get chain yeah and then minus two links
to get all the ref so that's a total of
two n minus three which is data a pin
right hey yeah I guess kind of a another
way to think about it in this case I
guess it's kind of simple but one thing
I like to with you some more complicated
graphs is like what happens when you add
one more edge it's like you have your
combination lock and you had another
edge you're going to add two more nodes
it's kind of each edge you know adds two
nodes and so you know it's going to
continue to grow grow linearly then you
think about what what you have if you
have one note i yeah I guess kind of the
jump from the first note of the second
note is our sorry from the first node to
the second note is a little different
cuz he only had one edge but you know
sort of when you think of big theta and
Big O notation you're dealing with you
know bigger numbers like how it grows as
it gets very large so because we're
doing big theta you don't really have to
think about the base case of zero nodes
or one node or two nodes but if you just
think about real case adding any node
I'm going to add two more edges so
that's David okay yes just yep consider
part of the eight part of the definition
is like you know for all N greater than
in not great like you have f of n is
less than it's like see one of G of n c2
of G of n and it's this part right here
so like you know as it gets as it gets
bigger you know you can
that you only have to worry about those
cases you don't have to worry about all
the numbers that are less than some some
a dot okay so yeah I mean there's for
this one it's simple and it's kind of
you know it's pretty easy to think about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
