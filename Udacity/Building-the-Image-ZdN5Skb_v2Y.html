installed software and build the images
we've provided all the files in a github
repository you should go ahead and clone
it to your local workstation the files
for this exercise are in the Packer
templates directory if you look an
application server dot JSON you'll see
that here we're using shell provisioners
that's just for simplicity so you don't
have to learn a new syntax even if
you're not familiar with shell scripts
don't worry take a look at some of them
notice that they're just a file and in
that file you'll just see one command
after another it's also possible in
Packer to use other provisioners like
chef or puppet or ansible or salt these
can provide more advanced functionality
you can see the provisioners listed here
in application server JSON and each one
points to one or more files in the
scripts directory they'll run in the
order that they're listed an interesting
note is that provisioners are used for
all builders unless specified otherwise
as you can see there's a couple of
scripts that are run only for the
VirtualBox ISO builder ok enough talk
go ahead and clone the repo change to
the Packer templates directory and
follow the instructions in the readme or
in the instructor notes when you run the
Packer build it will take a while after
all it first has to download the OS
image then install it in a VM then
install all the software and then at the
end compress and save the image so once
you do that take a look through the
application server JSON file and see if
you can answer these questions first
what directory does the post processor
save the final artifact in goes our
variable for it enter that variable
including the curly braces around it and
second what's the file extension for the
final artifact but that here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
