object model is that much of the heavy
lifting that an application programmer
has to do in building a client-server
system using RPC things like marshalling
unmarshal e-publishing
the remote object on the network for the
clients to access they're all subsumed
under the covers by the Java distributed
object runtime and this is where one can
see the similarity between the
subcontract mechanism in the spring
system that we saw recently which was
the origin in some sense for the Java
RMI before we dig deeper let me give you
at a high level the distributed object
model of Java the term remote object in
the object model of Java refers to
objects that are accessible from
different address spaces and the term
remote interface is used in the
distributed object model to say what are
all the declarations for methods in a
remote object once you have a remote
object the interface remote interface is
saying what are all the declarations or
for methods that are existing in the
remote object that are accessible from
clients anywhere that's what remote
interfaces and in the distributed object
model of Java the clients have to deal
with RMI exception so that's the failure
semantics of the distributed object
model that the clients have to deal with
exceptions that might happen when a
remote method is invoked by a client and
there are some similarities and
differences between local objects in
Java and remote objects the similarity
is that you can pass object references
as parameters when you make an object
invocation an object invocation
arguments of the invocation could
include object references that's the
similarity but the difference is that
the parameters when it is passed it is
passed as value result that's the
difference between local object and
remote object in the case of local
object when you pass an object reference
as a parameter then the method that is
invoked can reach into that object that
been passed as a parameter as a
reference and make modifications to it
and that modifications will get
reflected in the original object but in
the distributed object model because the
object references are passed as value
result going across the network and has
passed as value result meaning the copy
of their object is actually sent over to
the invoked method and that invoked
method is seeing the copy of the object
and it is even though there is a
reference being given but the reference
is actually converted into value result
in the parameter passing mechanism for
the distributed object model so that's a
fundamental difference in parameter
passing so there's both similarities in
the sense that you can pass object
reference as a parameter but the
difference is the reference is passed in
a value result mode as opposed to a pure
reference so in other words once an
object reference has been passed as a
parameter to the server if the client
makes changes to that particular object
whose reference has been given in the
invoked method those changes the server
will not see it because that is local to
the client that's fundamentally
different between the local object model
of Java and the distributed object model
of Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
