hours we've had a lot of really good
discussion in the forums and some great
questions let's start with a question
from my tool um yes
in the last episodes you mentioned
something about the possibility of a
project at the end of the class what are
your thoughts on us building are the
students building a robotic car so I
just recorded the final class and I
actually spent some time programming
putting everything together into an
assimilation of a car I mean at the
level we've been operating not a real
car and honestly it took me a whole day
to myself Thank You Hannah so it's a
substantial work because at the surface
like these pieces fit together nicely
but when you put them together you
realize that the planet generates isn't
quite exactly what the controller really
wants and tuning those parameters was
actually a challenge but what I've done
is for the final class I'm giving you
the environment first and say solve the
problem of finding driving cough may to
be and if you really incur a so inclined
you can go out and retry it but as the
class goes on I give you most of my
implementation leaving bits and pieces
out and then you can go and plug those
bits and pieces and hopefully make it
work ok great thanks unfortunately I
can't we get you a real card that's the
real fun thing and as you'll see in the
final example the methods that we've
discussed are the core methods and they
give you a good path but they will give
you a path good enough for extra driving
so there's a lot of work that goes
beyond this class that could be done to
make things smoother and more elegant
perfect tangled ask in the unit 414
video you mentioned something about
other cars honking and he wants to know
if junior can here does he have a
microphone sensor that affects its
actual actions and can he hawk himself
so none of our cars here and none of our
cars honk and I know it's some certain
parts of the world that's kind of a
recipe for not driving confidently
safely in traffic but he chose not to
make of all your communication part of
that experiment and then George bindara
asked what's possible to constantly
replan if enough computational power is
available a star assumes a static and
deterministic world so can you comment
on some of the possible pitfalls of a
fault of using a star and what are some
of the alternatives to this Albert so
that's a great
and really deep questions to which I've
dedicated a number of research years
turns out and I've graduated a number of
PhD students on that very topic so a
star gives you a taste of how cool
planning can be but there's many many
open problems so for example a star
cannot deal with branching outcomes
where you flip a coin and you have to
pursue both outcomes it just doesn't
work and it cannot deal with information
gathering so I'm not you in planning
what you want to do is you want to take
a specific action just for the sake of
reducing uncertainty so for example if I
I know I'm going to a grocery store and
I don't know where they are money with
me I might just check do everybody here
and and this checking action has no
other bearing informing me that my money
is in my SMI pockets that is completely
not doable with a Starman now the
dynamic programming stuff that I
discussed has that flavor so you can
actually pursue my blood cups and bring
them together it is computationally very
inefficient so you have to basically the
internal state space and the fact that
the universal plans is just a side
effect of pursuing every possible
combination so the moment the state
space gets very large dynamic
programming doesn't scale and it's a big
open issue now if we go to something
like Google Maps what you'll find is
that they can do instant paths depending
between two points and what Google has
been doing is pre-caching a lot of the
sub plans principle sub plans so the
remaining planning problem of finding
the shortest path becomes mostly a table
lookup and they've done this in a way
that's actually optimal they can prove
it's optimal for path planning
it's really an amazing achievement
that's way beyond a star so the planning
field is much more interesting than the
lecture you just want to get your juices
flowing to have you use one now we did
use a star in our world and the way we
address re-planning in the Khan
environment is that we just plan really
fast
so you had a version of a star that was
super fast and we saw something new
which was replan and that was just fine
for us okay so you mentioned something
about dynamic programming just now in a
Chiappetta I'm sorry the user a Jeff had
a very good question about that how
large is the planning policy for junior
so in in juniors case and the Google
self-driving car cases we don't do that
much planning we basically plan only
within the visual
Rison of the vehicle itself so we don't
address the problem how to get from here
to Paris what streets to take we assume
that solve it we may absolutely assume a
fixed route in all our driving but once
the fixed route is kind of specked out
all the plane that takes places within
the visual range of the robot and there
are typically three dimensional state
spaces that typically XY and orientation
now in some of our experiments we also
use velocity as a as a state variable
because sometimes you want to take a
little detour signals straight and be
faster but they're relatively low
dimensional spaces okay another question
from George Bryn Darrow was about
prohibitively expensive left left turns
so are the cost of actions are these a
dynamic variable that's constantly being
updated or they static within the car so
the way we've handled the cost of action
is we have a version that looks at the
global picture like four go from A to B
and find the cost there and then zooming
back to the local picture in the local
picture able to to actually consider
cars right now at this moment whereas in
the global picture we assume a static
world and we make a fixed cost for left
turns now as you go to the local picture
we do a lot of local rollouts local look
ahead plans not not dissimilar form a
star and then fill in the actual costs
of left turns and replace them with the
assumed cost and that sometimes needs
two different actions you have
situations where your plane to do a lane
shift but we can because it's just too
expensive right now and we rather endure
being stuck behind a slower car until
the lane shift is cleared so the
interplay of two levels of planning
volume a deep hole want to know about
multi goal environments and an obvious
example in a multi goal environment
would be a parking lot I want to get to
an empty parking spot so that's a great
question I should ask you with the
students because as really nice and
obvious answer which is here's the
answer in a star you can certainly
designated multiple states to be called
States
nothing premises you just have to make
sure your wrist ik is admissible so it
takes a value that is under estimating
or at least estimating correctly the
distance to any of those cold states and
it's just fine
the same is true for dynamic programming
you can certainly have multiple states
there nothing in the formulation is a
problem so talking about heuristic
functions truenox have a question and I
think a lot of people are wondering
since this is really where a star gets
its speed is in the her choice of the
heuristic function ah are they deduced
algorithmically are they just done with
intuition trial and error how do we
decide that's it that's true that's
that's a fantastic question there's
actually deep questions as well in the
car domain we actually calculate
heuristic functions and we have to
eristic function we can superimpose and
both of them get at the gist of the
planned problem but they're much easier
to compute so suppose you have an
environment with obstacles and you're
planning space is 2-dimensional like you
your X your Y and the orientation one
way to do your ristic is to ignore the
rotational degree of freedom and assume
you're moving in this in any direction
and obviously moving a robot any
direction is is easier than being
constrained by the physics of the car so
this becomes now two-dimensional problem
and by going for three dimensions two
dimensions we can solve the entire
problem in no time so we plan in 2d and
use the 2d planning result as a
heuristic for the 3d planner and the
reason why it works is because 2d
planning is so much faster than feedback
there's one the second so this is
basically ignoring the physical
constraints of the car and going to a
simpler car model which is it can move
an interaction a time the
second heuristic reusing looks at the 3d
problem but without obstacles so we can
pre-plan the optimal action of a 3d
robot is turning constraints in a 3d
space X by an orientation to any core
location in advance we do this once and
it's true forever without any obstacles
and what this gets us is it sometimes to
get in a certain target orientation you
have to take certain turn and that turn
has to be taken no matter what and
obstacles will only make it worse
so if you compute this obstacle free
heuristic you could sort of get an
underestimate that gets only avoided
obstacles so you have a nice realistic
we tossed both of these heuristics in s0
six and a star and we get a speed-up of
a planar easy of a factor of 10 to 100
in practice that's very interesting
right so so it's actually and give these
examples I don't want to implement those
right now but that shows you how deep
this question video is if you can come
up with good ways of cheating and
solving the problem by the lexan
constraint do it much faster
that tends to be a great heuristic
voiced arm alright well thanks a lot now
we had a lot of great questions I'm sure
we'll have a lot next week can you give
us a little preview of what's coming in
units 5 &amp;amp; 6
yes worst of all I want to thank you for
this question I really appreciate how
deep they are and how much you connect
with the material I think that's that's
great I mean I honestly personally I
much prefer the more questions as like
when can I buy my next self-driving car
I think this is really deep material I'm
trying to teach you and I love the fact
that many of you are diving in and
really deeply because that's what I want
to enable you to do to apply it in a
deep way so keep these questions coming
in section unit five and six I'll dive
in to control controllers now the art of
turning these abstract like discrete and
chunking paths into actual steering
motion it's a continuous thing because
your steering is continuous and time is
continuous we're going to go away from
the discrete world Goody's world and in
unit six I try to toss everything
together so in unit six we program
hopefully in a half a car with my help
where we go all the way the localization
at the same time and passing the same
time in control and hopefully generate
some extra driven trajectories
biosimilars car okay I can't wait I'm
sure the students feel the same way and
thanks a lot it's you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
