we know that he's going to have to pay
twelve hundred dollars for rent each
month so his expenses are going to start
at twelve hundred dollars and they
continue to increase incremental e for
each wiper set he produces so we need to
include both of these pieces of
information in our equation that means
that this answer choice 6.5 x number of
glasses wiper sets made can't be right
because it doesn't account for the
monthly rent the first choice here is
actually not right either because this
is saying that for every glasses wiper
set that grant makes he will pay twelve
hundred dollars now be pretty
unfortunate for him that would be a very
very expensive wiper business and we
also know that it costs six dollars and
fifty cents not twelve hundred dollars
to make you twat per set that leaves us
with two more choices both of which
include 1200 and 6.5 x number of glasses
wipers made the difference between these
is the sign here if we pick this third
answer choice right here we'll be seeing
that grants monthly expenses decrease
because of this negative sign right here
decrease for every glass Swiper said he
makes this would mean that he would
actually be making money off of paying
for materials which doesn't really make
sense that means this answer choice
isn't right either the last one is
correct great we'll spend a fixed amount
of twelve hundred dollars and then on
top of that he will spend six dollars
and fifty cents for every white person
he makes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
