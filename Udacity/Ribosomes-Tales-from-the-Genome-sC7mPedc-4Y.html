the answer is the last one right here
methionine or m-pr prolene d or
aspartate or s or searing now if you
have trouble getting this let's walk
through it really quick I can
immediately get rid of these first three
answers over here from one very
important reason we have one start codon
and it is Matheny a ribosome is looking
for that start codon and if i read my
mrna ACA nope that's not it CAG nope
that's not it AGA nope that's not it G
au nope that's not it Aug there it is
aug aug two I start codon right that
means i get a math I innate none of
these start with methionine all of these
start with threonine which is an ACA so
if you just start at the beginning you
would have started with the three and in
and probably gotten one of these three
answers this is the one I think if you
end up going all the way to the very end
and the second one is if you might have
noticed a stop codon a CAG Aug CC UGA
stop right and some of you might have
stopped completely and just put TDA or
if you stopped and then kept going right
that would not have been accurate as we
see over here is a better example of why
you wouldn't want to do that we know now
that we want to start at Aug okay so now
I know the first one is Matheny and
because we have a non-overlapping code
our next one is CCU we don't do ugc or
GCC the next codon is CC you go over
here CCU is prolene so we have a pee
they all have a pee the next one is G au
g a you ass part 8d they all have that
the next one will be you see a you see a
searing right here so the next one
should be serially all have that and
then we get to UGA and you'll notice
that you g is one of our special stop
codons this would tell the ribosome to
stop translating right here
and actually the only one that stops is
in pds this last one right here the
other ones actually keep going ACC ACC
is threonine right they actually thought
that they should drop in another amino
acid and keep on going when you get to a
stop codon you stop translating from Aug
to UGA this would be our actual code
that gets turned into protein</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
