computed the reduction 025 that you've
seen just a few minutes ago and multiply
that by 51 to get one of these six
values that's the job for red it's the
exact same for green and for blue let's
try it out when i run the program i can
pick an image i get to see it before the
changes applied and when i click on ok
then the change is applied and when you
look carefully you'll now see that the
image looks coarser it has fewer colors
for example in this range here now
fortunately my catalyzer isn't on a
distant planet but if she was then it
would take far fewer pixels to Center
image to me the exact equations that we
just used aren't really important to
remember but the point that it wanted to
make is that even though integer
division doesn't sound like the most
interesting thing in the world it can be
put to good use and give you a fun
application go ahead and practice that a
bit more with Sarah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
