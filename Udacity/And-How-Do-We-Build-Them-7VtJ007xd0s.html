get a widget working how does a launcher
even know we have a widget the user
could choose to add to their home
screens there's two main pieces an app
widget provider XML file an app widget
provider class the app widget provide
our XML file is what describes your
widgets attributes such as its size
whether it can be resized and a preview
image which helps users get a sense of
what your widget will look like before
adding it to their home screen the app
widget provider is what holds all the
logic for creating the actual widget
views filling the views of the correct
data and setting up the cliq listeners
your widgets respond to touch one thing
to keep in mind is that users aren't
limited to just one instance of your
widget they could have a bunch of
different sized widgets with potentially
different data that's one reason why
part of your app widget provider info
can specify a configuration activity a
special one-time setup activity that
appears when users select your widget
while we won't use this for sunshine you
can imagine if sunshine supported
multiple locations at once we could use
a configuration activity to select which
location we wanted to display in each
widget so let's start simple we'll build
the one by one version of our today
widget with some static data say sunny
and 76 degrees Fahrenheit a nice 24
Celsius what would our app widget
provider info look like in fact there's
only a few required attributes first
here is initial layout this is the XML
layout to be used by default min height
and min-width are what determined how
many cells in the launcher are used note
that the number and size of cells can
change based on the device or launcher
being used a good rule of thumb is this
formula which works well for all default
launchers in any case you should build
your widget such as flexible enough to
support slight variations in the size
available the last attribute we can see
here is the update period Milly's by
default the system will wake up your
device
at approximately this interval and call
your app widget provider to update your
widget with a minimum update period of a
half hour however if you have static
data you don't want to wake up the data
if it's in deep sleep or if you have
another component already controlling
the flow of new data into your app such
as sunshine sync adapter you can use 0
to disable this functionality and
prevent unnecessary work that's all we
need to get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
