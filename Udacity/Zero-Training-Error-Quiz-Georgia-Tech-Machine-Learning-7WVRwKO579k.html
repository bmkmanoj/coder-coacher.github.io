a quick quiz thanks you're welcome
Michael I'm about helping others okay so
here's the problem let me set it up for
you let me know if if the question
doesn't make any sense okay so we have a
set of feet we have a problem we have a
learning problem that has four features
in the input space and I'm labeling them
a B C and D and here's a table that has
some training data you'll notice that
it's all binary I'm representing the
binaries as zeros and ones here and
that's the space that they're in and I
have a label minus or plus which you
could also think of as zeros and ones
okay
okay and here's what I want you to do I
want you to find the smallest subset of
features of a B C and D that's
sufficient to get zero training error
for these two different learning
algorithms decision trees the first one
and the second is a perceptron but a
very simple perceptron where you simply
have W transpose X greater than zero is
greater than zero you return positive if
it's zero or less you return negative
got it think so yeah
okay and so what I have out here are a
bunch of check boxes and I want you to
check off the variables that you need
are the features that you need in order
to allow decision tree to get zero
training error or to allow this simple
perceptron to get zero training er and
we're supposed to do this thinking of it
as a filtering thing or a wrapping thing
or yes I see so you just want to answer
the question and yes I want to answer
the question and as a hint you should be
thinking about this as a filtering or a
wrapping problem I was kind of hoping
you tell me which of those two um well
let's see you were really good at
picking filtering so think about it as
filtering okay so so I'm not gonna ask
you I'm not gonna require as a part of
the quiz that you tell me what criterion
you were using information gain or
entropy or variance or anything like
that
but when you give me the answer I'm
gonna ask you to explain it to me
because I'm curious what you're thinking
okay okay but I'm allowed to use the
label to answer it yes you're allowed to
use the label
if you want to if you think it's
necessary right because filtering
methods I well I guess you said that it
can't have access
to the label yes okay I got it
I think so yeah yeah all right good okay
okay well so go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
