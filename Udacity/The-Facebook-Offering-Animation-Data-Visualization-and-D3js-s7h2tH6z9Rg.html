want to cover is animation animation
isn't technically a visual encoding but
you can think of it as encoding some
information a rather change of
information in a certain sort of way as
we can see here the animation really
highlights how drastically different the
facebook IPO was in value compared to
the history of IPOs that came before it
not only does the animation convey some
of the process the RS went through in
creating this visualization such as
discovering that the facebook IPO was so
drastically greater than all the other
IPOs or the fact that using different
scaling in this case logarithmic makes
the graphic much more interpretable but
also gets across some of the relative
change of the companies in the years
after they've IP owed while you might be
able to encode the sort of information
such as how much a company's value has
changed after its IPO and another
dimension of visual encoding let's say
the z axis it is much easier and I think
much more effective to communicate that
information through the animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
