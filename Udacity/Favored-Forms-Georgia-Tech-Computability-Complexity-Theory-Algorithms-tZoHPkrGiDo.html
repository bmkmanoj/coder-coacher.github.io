to write any linear program in a variety
of forms two forms however tend to be
the most convenient and widely used
first is what we'll call the symmetric
form we'll see why it gets that name
when we consider duality and second is
the standard form the key difference
between the two is that we have changed
the inequality for an equality to better
understand the relationship between
these two forms i'm going to write the
standard form in terms of the symmetric
form to convert the m inequalities to
equality's we introduce em slack
variables X n plus 1 through xn plus M
and of course this means that we need to
augment our matrix a as well so that the
slack variables can do their job and see
also needs to be augmented so that we
can multiply it with the new X without
changing the value of the objective
function it's interesting to think about
the differences between these two forms
geometrically as well in the symmetric
case we're optimizing over a polytope in
n dimensions in the standard form
however these equality constraints here
define something called a flat which is
rather like a subspace only it's away
from the origin and then we're
intersecting that with the cone defined
by the positive coordinate axes and of
course we're in a higher dimension note
that we expect an optimum for the
symmetric problem to be at one of the
vertices of the polytope that is to say
of these M plus n constraints here n
must hold with equality or be tight in
the common parlance some might come from
a some might come from the
non-negativity constraints but there
will always be n of them over here in
standard form the notion of whether the
constraints of a are tight or not is
captured by the slack variables that we
introduced a slack variable is 0 if and
only if the corresponding constraint is
tight thus at least n of the variables
will be 0 when we were at a vertex of
the original polytope
in fact if I tell you which n variables
are zero and the ones that are nonzero
correspond to a linearly independent set
of constraints then you can construct
the rest of the variables based on the
Equality constraints we'll see this when
we talk about basic solutions now so far
I've kept on using the number of
variables N and the number of
constraints m from the symmetric form
even as we talk about the standard form
in general however when discussing the
standard form we redefine n to be the
old n plus M so don't get confused about
that one other thing to note about this
equality forum is that we can assume
that a is full range or has ranked M
where m is the number of rows that is to
say the rows should be linearly
independent if the roads aren't linearly
independent then there are two
possibilities one is that the
constraints are inconsistent meaning
that there is no solution the other
possibility is that the constraints are
redundant meaning that some of them can
be eliminated so from now on we'll just
assume that a has full rank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
