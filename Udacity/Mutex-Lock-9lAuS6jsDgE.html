people from taking my things or messing
with things they shouldn't I use a lock
to stop inteded programming we use a
similar concept to protect memory let's
say that inside some procedure there's a
block where I manipulate some data in
our example the variable a and I need to
be sure that no other thread touches
this variable while I am working on it
but they are executing this procedure or
another one well then I can declare a
lock variable which should reside in
shared memory and put the lock on before
I been doing my manipulation and unlock
it afterwards and I should do the same
wherever I manipulate this variable a if
some other thread running this code
simply accesses the shared resource
without using the lock it won't be able
to stop him but if he does try to
acquire the lock first then this call to
the mutex lock will block until the lock
variable shows that has been unlocked
and only then will this code proceed and
of course if the schedule had worked
things out so that this call had been
called first then he would get the lock
and this call to acquire the mutex lock
would block until this data manipulation
was finished and the mutex variable had
been unlocked in this way the threads
are able to mutually exclude each other
from using resources hence these are
called mutex locks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
