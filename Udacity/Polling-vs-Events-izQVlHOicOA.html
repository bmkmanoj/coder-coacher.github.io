presses they offer the user the tightest
control over the game and even if you're
building a mobile game where key presses
aren't relevant they're still incredibly
convenient free debugging there are a
couple different things you might want
to know about a key press say you're
building a platformer and you want to
control the left or right movement of
your character using the arrow keys each
frame you check if the left or the right
key is pressed and then move the
character in the appropriate direction
on the other hand say you want the
character to fire a grappling hook when
the spacebar is pressed in this case you
don't actually want to check the state
of the spacebar every frame you're only
interested in the moment the key is
pressed if the user holds down the
spacebar you don't care we have two
different approaches one where we want
to know the state of the inputs every
frame and one where we want to be
notified when certain things happen the
former approach is called polling and
the latter approach is known as event
based input will start with polling as
it's a bit simpler but we'll get to
event based input later on in the level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
