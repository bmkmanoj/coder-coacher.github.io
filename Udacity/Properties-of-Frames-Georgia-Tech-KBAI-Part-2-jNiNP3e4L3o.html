frames the first property is that frames
represent stereotypes now we all know
about stereotypes we deal with
stereotypes all the time here is a
stereotype for the verb eat or eight in
this particular stereotype the slots are
dealing with our stereotypical my
stereotypical notion of what happens
when something is eaten there is a
subject and it is a frog there is a
location that is a time you may have a
different set of stereotypes and 40
types often are very culture-specific
second frames provide default values so
not only do they have these slots which
come from over notions of a stereotype
of this particular world but the many of
these slots may have values already
filled in as an example I may already
have a default value which says that
after the object has been eaten it is no
longer alive it is inside the subject
stomach and the subjects mood is now
happy these are all default values of
course when you have defaults you can
have also of exceptions to them as an
example it may be there in a shook ate a
frog it made him sad because frogs don't
suit him very well and his exception
handling is both very powerful and a
problem it is powerful because I can
have stereotypes with default values and
when needed I can override the default
values but it's also a problem because
you can see what will happen the more
instances I have the more times will be
over adding some default values and then
I have to worry about how to manage all
of this exception handling nevertheless
frames provide a very nice way of
capturing both default values and
exception handling the third Cardinal
property of frames is that they exhibit
inheritance so I can organize these
frames in a frame hierarchy here is a
frame for an animal and then that has
two subclasses a frame for an aunt and a
frame for a human no time using the
language of classes and subclasses here
now inheritance works in that that I may
have some slots for the class animal and
then I may specify for the ant more
specific values for some of those slots
for example number of Lex's six or the
number of arms
zero but important thing is that I
inherited these slots from the
superclass of course when I specify the
subclasses when I go down this frame
hierarchy I may keep on adding
additional slots so for a human man may
also add the job in the name these
classes then may have instances as an
example Ashok is the name of the person
and the job is a professor and so this
instances are also inheriting all these
slots and the slot values from the class
we can also see that when frames provide
default values that's very similar to a
constructor when we're dealing with
object-oriented programming that supply
some initial values when a object is
first instantiated so it seems like
there's actually a very rich connection
between classes and frames here David
that's a very good point in fact it is a
history to it frames and object-oriented
programming came about the same time in
the 1960s in the 1970s and I'm sure
influenced each other in both directions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
