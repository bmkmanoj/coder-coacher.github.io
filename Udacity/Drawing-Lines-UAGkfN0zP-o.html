follow along by loading up one point
3.03 demo drawing lines so first let's
get startup as usual by declaring and
initializing a shape renderer also we
gotta remember to clean up after
ourselves and get rid of anything we're
not using also note instead of using
application listener we're using
application adapter here application
adapter is just a convenience
implementation of application listener
it stubs out all of the required methods
with implementations that don't do
anything so all we've got here is
actually create dispose and render
alright as always all the interesting
stuff happens in render so first we
clear this screen we actually clear the
screen and then we start a new shape
renderer batch this time using the line
shape type all right now we're gonna
draw a line from 0 0 to 100 100 let's
give it a try well that didn't go
according to plan there is nothing on
the screen and we actually got an error
down here let's see the legal state
exception call end before beginning a
new shape batch right so all we did here
was start the batch and then draw a line
but didn't end the batch the next time
render got called we tried to begin a
batch but shape renderer was already in
the middle of a batch so we got a crash
alright let's try this again awesome
we're in business let's try something
more interesting let's try drawing a
line of a different color by using shape
renderer set color and then using one of
the predefined color constants then
we'll draw another line slightly offset
from the first one hmm
whoops well we got our magenta line but
the first line we drew also ended up
magenta the way colors work with shape
renderer is it'll assume you want white
until you tell it about some other color
however if you tell it about some other
color it'll retroactively Lee assumed
everything you wanted to draw before
that you want it to draw that color as
well let's try this setup hey there we
go that's what we were looking for we
can also set colors using RGB a values
now before we draw this line what color
is this so it's fully opaque because
alpha is 1 that's good all right there's
no red
and there's no blue so the line must be
green let's run it and see our
predictions were correct we can even do
fancy things like drawing lines with
gradients by specifying the color at the
start of the line and the color at the
end and there we go we get a nice fade
from blue to red one more useful thing
for drawing lines if we wanted to draw a
whole series of line segments it would
get really tiresome to draw each one
individually so we also have polyline
polyline takes an array of floats where
the floats at the even positions are the
x coordinates and the floats that the
odd positions are the y coordinates if
we give this one a try we see this crazy
path with a bunch of connected line
segments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
