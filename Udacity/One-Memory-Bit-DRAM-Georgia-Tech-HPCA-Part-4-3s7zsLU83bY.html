is activated by the word line and that
connects the cell to the bit line but we
said that's the only transistor we have
the cell is made out of a simple
capacitor here so the idea is that to
write to this cell we will activate the
word line we put let's say a 1 into the
bit line this transistor connects the
capacitor to the bit line now what
happens is r1 effectively charges this
capacitor once we deactivate the word
line the capacitor retains the value
that corresponds to a 1 if we want to
write a zero we activate the word line
the capacitor is now connected to the
bit line that is connected to a zero
voltage and we empty this capacitor into
the bit line thus now our capacitor
becomes a zero value now when we
disconnect the word line the capacitor
has nothing in it so it retains the
value of zero so as you can see the bit
is really stored in this capacitor when
it's charged we are storing a 1 when
it's not charged we are storing a zero
so what's the problem here
well the problem is that this transistor
is not a perfect switch it's a little
bit leak here it's not a problem because
if it's a little bit leaking these two
are strong enough to retain the voltage
at you know let's say 1 and 0 or 0 and 1
while these are not trying to defeat but
here our capacitor is slowly leaking
into the bit line and eventually gets
empty so one problem with theorem is
that it will lose this bit over time and
that means that periodically we have to
actually read out this bit figure out
what it was and write it back in at full
voltage so that it can again leak for a
while before it gets lost another
problem with the RAM that you don't have
with SRAM is that once we open the word
line the capacitor drains into the bit
line we can sense what the value was but
the capacitor is no longer fully charged
this is called destructive read when you
read a dram
you have to write it back in it loses
the value as it gets read so this is
what is usually called a 60 cell or six
transistor cell there are two
transistors that are there for
connecting to the cell and there are
four transistors in the cell itself
because each of the inverters has two
transistors this is of course a one T
cell now the area occupied by an SRAM
cell obviously is the area occupied by
about six transistors the area of the
DRAM cell it looks like it's the area of
one transistor and the area of a
capacitor the bigger this capacitor the
longer it can retain something that
corresponds to a one or a zero before it
gets lost so we want this capacitor to
be big a capacitor can be viewed as two
metal plates placed very close to each
other the bigger the area of the plates
the bigger the capacitance of the
capacitor it can keep more charged so it
looks like to make a good deal and cell
we will have to make a big cell because
this capacitor will need a lot of metal
area to build large plates but this is
not how we build this capacitor the
transistor and the capacitor itself are
actually built as a single transistor in
a technology that is called trench cell
so this end of this transistor is simply
buried deeply into the silicon substrate
when we manufacture transistors so
really the capacitor is kind of buried
under the transistor so we really get
the area of the transistor itself and
not much around it you can see also that
the DRAM cell can be smaller because it
doesn't need this second bit line we
just need one so that also makes it
slightly smaller we don't need as much
