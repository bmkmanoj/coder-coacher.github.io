introduction to data science during this
lesson we're going to be focusing on
some basic methods in statistics and
machine learning that you can use to
analyze data during the last lesson we
mainly focused on methods to acquire and
clean data from a variety of sources
such as relational databases api's and
flat files however we also discuss some
basic methods that you can use to verify
the integrity of your data and while
you're doing that you might learn some
very basic things for example you might
know who the tallest shortstop to ever
play in Major League Baseball was or how
many people over the age of 65 enrolled
in the odd Hart program in a particular
district you might find though that you
want to answer some more subtle
questions for example we might want to
know our left-handed batters any better
than right-handed batters or hey is
there any correlation between age and
the Aadhaar rejection rate we'll use
statistics and machine learning to
answer these types of questions we'll
also find that these methods are really
useful for answering questions about
ridership on the New York City Subway
for example we might be able to discover
whether time of day or the weather
outside influence how many people are
riding the subway during this lesson
we're going to assume some basic
familiarity with stats if you haven't
seen the stuff or if you feel lost it
might be a good idea to enroll in stats
