n thirds which is 1.71 to the power of n
now if you compare that to the algorithm
that we had before that was about 1.7 3
so the improvement here is rather a
marginal but there's two things to be
said here the first one is that the
pre-processing rule that we used what
was actually a rather trivial one it
just concerned those vertices that have
a single neighbor there's much more
complex pre-processing rules that will
then allow you to design much better
search trees and the other thing is that
we're using a very simple analysis of
the search tree here we're basically
they're saying there's eight possible
assignments and we're just using five of
them and in a more sophisticated search
tree analysis what you would do you
would not always have the same number of
assignments in each of the cases that
you go into so you could have a search
tree that for example and one
possibility only assigns two vertices of
value and another possibility it assigns
five vertices of value and so on and
through this refined analysis you can
get much better as well soon see for
vertex cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
