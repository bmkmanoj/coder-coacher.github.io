training data look like it's the same
terrain data that we had in the last one
we're trying to figure out whether you
can go fast or you have to go slow on
this terrain so with that I'm going to
head back over to Google I know that I
want to use scikit-learn and support
vector machine alright so we've lots of
options here let's just jump right in
we'll click on the first one okay so
support vector machines scrolling
through a little bit the first thing
that I see is there's some advantages
and disadvantages to support vector
machines so that's pretty interesting
those might be points at all we'll
revisit a little bit later in the class
but I am impatient and I want to start
coding so the first thing it gives me
classification fantastic and I can see
that there's already example code that's
ready to go so let's find this example
code okay this is starting to look a
little bit familiar now so I have my
import statement have my training
features and I have my training labels
like I did in a last example with naive
Bayes I create my classifier I fit it
using my my training features and my
training labels and then down here they
have us they show us how to do a
prediction so as you can see it's
actually exactly the same few lines of
code only instead of now saying Gaussian
naive Bayes or whatever I'm calling it
an SVC and this is one of the things
that's really nice about a scikit-learn
is that basically all the classifiers
that we'll be looking at and all the
classifiers that you might use sort of
on your own in the future will follow
this same pattern where you import it
you create it you fit it and you make
predictions and it's always going to be
the same syntax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
