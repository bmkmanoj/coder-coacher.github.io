to use a complex data structure like a
list I'm going to talk some about how
computers actually store data to use the
list you don't really need to understand
this but it will certainly give you a
better appreciation of what's going on
inside the computer so in order to store
data you need two things you need
something that preserves state and can
be in more than one state two states is
enough and you need something that can
read the state of that thing so one way
to think about that is to think about a
light switch so here we have a switch we
have our light bulb presumably it's also
connected to some power source and when
we flick the switch that turns the light
bulb on it changes its state the light
bulb has two different states it can be
off or on so that means it can store one
bit of data in the next lecture I'll
talk more about what a bit means but
something that can have two distinct
states can store one bit and if we had
enough light bulbs well we can store
many many bits which will be enough to
keep track of any amount of data that we
want it we don't need just something
that can change state though we need
something that can also sense the state
with a light button well that could be
someone's eye you can see if the light
bulb is on or off and then you know it's
state you could have a light sensor that
would do that if you wanted to make that
automatic the way computer store data is
sort of like this except for it's using
much less energy and much less space
than a light bulb to store the state of
data and it's not using a human eye it's
using sensing electrons or sensing
magnetism to sense the state of
something so that's one way to store
data is like a switch and the fastest
memory in your computer works that way
the data that's stored directly in the
processor which is called the register
is stored like a switch that makes it
very fast to change its state to record
what the status but it's also like a
light bulb it means that when we turn
the power off we lose the state so it's
not persistent and it's a lot more
expensive than other ways of storing
data the other way computers store data
is more like a bucket we could represent
having a 1 by having a bucket that's
full we could represent having a 0 by
having a bucket that's empty then to
check the state of the bucket we could
weigh the bucket or look at the bucket
to figure out whether
fuller empty and the difference between
buckets and lightbulbs is well buckets
leak a little bit waters falling out of
the bucket and they also evaporate so if
we want to store our data using a bucket
it won't last forever
eventually the bucket will evaporate and
we can't tell the difference between a 0
and a 1 and I should also point out that
the amount of water in the bucket well
we're going to have to decide some
threshold where if it's above that
threshold we think that it represents a
1 if it's below that threshold we think
it represents a 0 we could certainly
imagine having many more levels than
just 2 in the bucket for computing it's
almost always the case that we want to
use a digital abstraction where
everything only represents one of two
things that makes it less likely that we
get it wrong as the water evaporates we
know it's still a 1 until it gets really
near the bottom but when it gets near
the bottom there's going to be some left
and we want to know when it becomes a 0
when we're doing this with electrons we
don't call it a bucket we call it a
capacitor the memory in your computer
that works this way is called DRAM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
