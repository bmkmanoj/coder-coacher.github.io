word plays and we sort them in reverse
order again so that biggest our first
this time by word score and then we just
take the first den and by doing the
subscript thing like that it works when
n is too big it works with it when N
equals none not just an aside here as
the great American philosopher Benjamin
Parker once said with great power comes
great responsibility so we have a great
power here to go through all the words
in the dictionary and come up with all
the best plays now I could read in the
official scrabble dictionary and I could
apply the board position that you saw in
my game with Ken and I could come up
with a bunch of good plays but that
wouldn't be fair to my friend Ken unless
we had a previously agreed that it was
legal and fair to do so so I'm not going
to do that I got to resist that
temptation and throughout your career as
an engineer these types of temptations
or these types of possibilities are
going to come up having strong ethics is
part of learning to be a good software
engineer so now in terms of our pacing
we've achieved milestone number two we
can stop sprinting again we can relax
and have a drink we can lay down we can
congratulate ourselves or do whatever we
want to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
