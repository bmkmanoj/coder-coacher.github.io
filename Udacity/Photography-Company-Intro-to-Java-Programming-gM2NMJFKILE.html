group of friends to create a freelance
photography company you've taken on the
role of manager and your friends are the
photographer's customers describe
photography assignments to you and you
label the assignments with priorities
each day you have a team meeting where
you give out the highest priority
assignments to your friends each
photographer can do one assignment per
day and every so often you like to
review all of the pictures in the
company portfolio what are some of the
methods that might be carried out by
objects of those classes this is a very
open-ended question what you come up
with will depend on how you imagine this
situation there are a lot of correct
answers here
I haven't specified every single step of
the program so everything's open to
interpretation
what nouns do you want to make classes
out of and what are the methods that
might go with those nouns I won't give
an automatic grade but will be
collecting the answers and analyzing
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
