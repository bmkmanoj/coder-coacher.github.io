choose a pattern so this is a possible
approach that you can follow first of
all you want to make sure that you
understand your design context you
understand what you're designing and
what are the issues involved with this
design what are the problems that you
need to solve at this point you can
examine the patterns catalog or if
you're already familiar with the kettle
just think about the possible patterns
that you could use once you identify the
patterns that you can use you also wanna
study them and study the related
patterns so normally if you look at any
pattern catalog for each pattern there
will also be a list of related patterns
so you can also look at those to see
whether maybe some of those might be
more applicable and finally once you
identify the panel that you think is
appropriate you will apply that pattern
when you do that just be mindful that
there are pitfalls in the use of
patterns one obvious one is the fact
that you might select the wrong pattern
and make your design worse instead of
better and the second one is that if you
get too excited about patterns then you
might be abusing pattern so it's just
using too many patterns and end up with
a design that is more complicated rather
than less complicated so always be
careful spend the time to figure out
which one is the right pattern to apply
and make sure that you don't use
patterns that you don't actually need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
