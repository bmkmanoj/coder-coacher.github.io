negative 2 is the point 6.5 6.5 of
course you could write this as a
fraction instead of a decimal two if you
want it to but how do we get that well
in order to get halfway from here to
here we know that we need to go half as
far both horizontally and vertically
let's once again start with the
horizontal distance or the distance in X
our x coordinates of our given points
are three and ten so halfway between
three and ten is what well the distance
from three to ten is just 10-3 so that
means that halfway between 10 and 3 is
just 10 minus 3 over 2 and simplifying
that gives us 7 halves or three and a
half this however is not our coordinate
this is just the distance that we need
to move from one point toward the other
point so to figure out our actual
coordinate we need to start at one of
our points and walk toward the other
point this far so our x-coordinate is
just equal to 3 plus 7 halves which is
just 13 / 2 or 6.5 let's do the same
thing for the y coordinate our Y
coordinates are 15 and negative 2 if we
use our handy dandy grid here to count
how far this distance actually is we can
see that it is 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 plus
one more to be even with this point 17
so we need to move 17 boxes vertically
to get from negative 2 to 15 half of
that is just 17 / 2 or eight and a half
but again this is not actually our
y-coordinate this is just the distance
vertically between these two points
define the coordinate we need to start
at one of these points and then move
this vertical distance toward the other
so if we start at 15 we need to move
down eight and a half since negative two
is below 15 and this gives us a
y-coordinate of 13 / 2 let's graph this
point just as a sanity check 6.5 6.5
should be right about here and if we
draw a line from our first point to our
second point you see that this point
does in fact lie on the line and looks
halfway between them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
