couple of issues that you'll always face
when you're doing tracking so the first
one is initialization how do you start
the thing and there's no good answer the
examples that showed you before were
done manually somebody says out track
that okay so you draw a little so I say
keep track of that thing you might have
a background subtraction method okay so
every now and then you may be able to
subtract that a background find the
objects and say okay keep track of that
object because it's isolated and I'm
going to track it as it moves along even
when it becomes like partially occluded
or with other moving things in the way
or you might have a detector that can
detect things when they're clear and
fully visible right so I've got a bank
robber detector no I might have a
particular car detector and it's up a
Jeep has just showed up follow that Jeep
so the detector is running and it'll
only fire sometimes when it gets a good
clear view of something but then you
want to track and follow it through next
question is where do you get your sensor
and your dynamics models from well we've
talked a little bit about this your
dynamics models you maybe can learn by
essentially from real data that's
generally pretty hard because if you
could track the real data without the
dynamics model you wouldn't be using the
dynamics model so you might use it from
clean data I remember we talked about
the girl jumping in front of the black
background that would be some clean data
or it says here you might specify domain
knowledge that means you're like the
smart person you just write down what it
is or you take another trip to Delphi
and you get another thing from an Oracle
now for the observation model typically
it says generative observation model
what that means is remember we did this
be a model for the robot sensing
distance so if I knew the wall was 3
meters away and I take some measurements
and I collect them and I get a
distribution now I know what my
distribution would be the trick is I had
to know that the thing was actually
three meters away or two meters away
right I have to know the ground truth so
you have some sort of absolute sensor
measurement prediction versus
Corrections remember this whole thing
about tracking and inferences I make
some prediction I take some measurements
I do Mike
correction the question is what's that
relative trade-off remember we talked
about this in Kalman filter which
basically came down to what's the
relative size of the noise of my
measurements versus the noise of my
process actually usually the noise of my
process versus the noise of my
measurements and one is too strong
you'll ignore the data if the other is
too strong you'll ignore the predictions
so getting those balanced right is just
a little bit of magic that you have to
do based upon looking at the data here's
a more interesting or i should say
fundamental one it's referred to as data
Association data Association basically
is what if we don't know which
measurements to associate with which
tracks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
