I'll admit I got it wrong twice myself
in trying to answer it but I'm pretty
sure I know the correct answer now which
is that none of these are actually
equivalent to s dot fine T comma I if
you didn't get that that's okay two of
them are pretty close and the two that
are pretty closer to the first and the
third but none of them are exactly
correct and let's go through an example
to understand why so let's suppose we
started with s is Udacity
let's make T city and make i3 so if we
do s dot find T comma I what we're gonna
get starting from position I which is NS
looking for city we're gonna find it
right there the output of s dot find T
comma I with these variables is going to
be three so it searches starting from
position three but it's still going to
give us the output where that's position
three it gives us the output in terms of
the positions in the original string s
so the first one s I : where I is three
is going to be this string so when we do
the find where that's the string we find
city at position zero the result of this
is zero that's not the same as the
result we expect which is three the
second one doesn't actually make any
sense
so here s dot find evaluates to a number
and then we're trying to index from a
number that doesn't make any sense
we can only index from a string select a
subsequence of characters
there's no way to select a subsequence
of characters from a number so this is
invalid definitely doesn't produce the
same output as s dot find T comma I the
third one's the trickiest one this is
one that I originally thought would be
equal and for this particular case it is
in this case when we do s 3 : fine T
well that's going to produce the result
0 that we saw before and then when we
add I to it we're gonna get the value 3
so in cases where we find the string T
in s starting from position I this will
be equivalent if we made to something
else so let's suppose
we made tea dog well then what's going
to happen is the result of s find T
comma I when T is dog that result would
be negative one find always returns
negative one when the string we're
searching for is not found in this case
we'd have negative one as the result for
this add I to it
that would give us the number two that's
not the same as negative one so this
also is not equivalent in cases where T
is found it is equivalent but in cases
where T is not found it's not equivalent
the fourth one is also not equivalent
for the fourth one we're starting from
selecting the subsequence of s starting
from position I and we're looking for
the string T where we subsequence from T
starting from position I this won't give
us the same result as s dot find T comma
I so this was kind of a tricky question
you're not upset if you didn't get it
right but the answer is none of these
are actually equivalent to s dot find to
come I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
