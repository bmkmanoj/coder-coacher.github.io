an engaging game and you have insight
into how game design can keep players
returning to your game so what do you
think with the key takeaways from this
lesson hmm I think the most important
thing I've learned is that there's no
one way to monetize your game or get
your players engage in it but to make a
great game you always want to keep your
audience in mind and choose the best
game pays for them yeah building a game
so it gets more difficult over time and
involves friendly competition is a great
way to keep your game interesting and
keeping players interested and having
high player retention is the main way
your game will make money and not fizzle
out besides game pace we also made sure
that a game was easy to use across
devices by saving all our data into the
cloud and building in an easy restart
mechanism and finally we talked about
how to get a fan base who can help you
promote your game through social
networks and outreach a couple of times
we've also mentioned ways to make money
in your game through in-app ads
purchases and so on but we'll talk about
this in more detail in the next section
which is all about monetization
strategies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
