diagram now let's look at the third
compartment this is the one for
operations once again there's optional
visibility using the same symbols we had
before there's the name there may be a
return type if the operation returns
some value it's not shown in these
particular examples then there's a list
of parameters just like you would have
if you were describing some method
within an object-oriented language the
parameter list includes a name of the
parameter its type you may express a
default value and you may also indicate
whether the particular parameter is an
input parameter an output parameter or
an in/out parameter in out parameters
are those in which the value can come in
and a different value can be returned
those kinds of Perham adjectives in out
and in out are not shown in this
particular example in addition to the
parameters in the operations section you
can give some properties some of those
properties are expressed within the
braces like we've seen before for
example you can indicate that a
particular operation is a query
operation that is it's only providing
information about some existing
attributes that in within the class you
can there's there's properties
describing concurrency there's there's
properties describing whether or not
this particular operation is abstract as
would be seen in an abstract method in
an object-oriented language and you can
also show that a particular operation
has class scope that's shown by an
underline on the operation name and what
class scope means is that it's not a
operation of particular instance but an
operation for the class as a whole for
example let's say you wanted to know how
many instances of vehicles you had
already instantiated you can't query any
particular instance and ask it about
other and
dunces instead you query the class using
a class scoped operation and the class
if you've implemented things correctly
can provide the answer back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
