kinetic energy using MGH for the
gravitational potential energy so once
again we start with conservation of
energy the idea that the kinetic energy
and the potential energy always add up
to the same value no matter what point
we're at in our experiment now we know
that the ball starts off of no initial
velocity so we can say that the initial
kinetic energy is zero and we know that
the ball lands on the ground at height
zero so the final potential energy is
also zero so this gives us that the
final kinetic energy is just equal to
the original potential energy which is
equal to MGH and plugging in the values
50 meters 9.8 meters per second squared
and 1 kilogram we get that the final
kinetic energy is 490 joules now let's
repeat that calculation except this time
we'll use the more general formula for
gravitational potential energy so once
again we start with conservation of
energy and just like last time the
initial kinetic energy is zero now this
time we can't say that the final
potential energy is zero because our
formula is slightly different in fact
this formula is only ever equal to 0
when R gets really really really really
really really large and that's not gonna
happen anytime in our problem so we
can't ever say that the potential energy
is zero but we can still do the math and
solving for final kinetic energy we get
that it's the difference between the
original potential energy and the final
potential energy and we can our plug in
our formula for those to get this
equation and inserting our known values
into this equation we get that the final
kinetic energy using this version of the
gravitational potential energy is 486
joules not bad that's actually quite
close to 490 and using these values to
calculate a percent error I get that my
percent error for the final kinetic
energy is 0.76 percent that's not bad at
all so really MGH is pretty good for
calculating gravitational potential
energy over distances like 50 meters but
as we'll see later if we need to do much
larger distances we'll have to use this
version of gravitational potential
energy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
