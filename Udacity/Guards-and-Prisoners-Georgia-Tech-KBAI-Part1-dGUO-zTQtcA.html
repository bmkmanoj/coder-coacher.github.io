three things knowledge representations
problem-solving techniques and
architectures we have already looked at
one knowledge representation semantic
networks we have not so far looked at
problem solving methods or architectures
today I'd like to start by talking about
the problem-solving method let us
illustrate the problem-solving method of
generate and test with the same example
that we have discussed earlier when we
were discussing this example it gives
the semantic networks we simply came up
with various states and prune some of
them without saying about how an agent
would know what states to prove so
imagine that we have a generator that
takes the initial state and from that
initial or current state generates all
the possible successor States for now
imagine is not a very smart Jenner it is
a dumb generator so it generates all the
possible states so the generated test
matter not only has a generator it also
has a tester the tester looks at all the
possible states that generator has
generated and removes some of them for
now let's also assume that the tester is
dumb as well and so the tester is
removes only those states that are
clearly illegal based on the
specification of the problem namely that
one cannot have more prisoners than
guards on either back so the first any
third states are removed by the tester</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
