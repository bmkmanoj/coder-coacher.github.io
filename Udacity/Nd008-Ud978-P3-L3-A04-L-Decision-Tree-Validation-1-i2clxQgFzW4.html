can go and use the model comparison tool
to be able to analyze the quality of the
decision tree model with an independent
sample so what I'm going to do is go
over to my predictive section and bring
in that model comparison tool I'm going
to load in the model object from the
decision tree into this model comparison
tool into the M or model input and the
validation data set from the create
samples tool into the D our data side
this option of the positive class in a
target variable we do not need to put in
anymore since we're not trying to
predict a binary categorical variable
but rather non-binary categorical data
so there's no true positive class or
negative class here so instead what I'm
going to just do is leave that blank put
in a browser tool after this our output
so let's maximize these results now and
go interpret them so the decision tree
had an accuracy of the estimation sample
up in ninety-six percent which is quite
high but now with the model does not
perform quite as well with the
validation sample as the overall
accuracy is much much lower at
eighty-four percent this makes me wonder
if we can build out a better model that
is a little more reliable this
unreliability is often seen in decision
trees due to their tendency to over fit
the model to their data sets the other
model types we're going to use is a
forest model and busa models and they're
both used as an extension to decision
trees but do just a good job at
combating this overfitting issue let's
explore an exciting model next call the
forest model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
