raster image because some things just
can't be represented well by a vector
drawing this is a 21 megapixel photo of
my cat obviously you probably really
don't need that resolution push down to
a mobile device if I'm just writing a
blog post about my cat this is a 4 mega
byte image after all so what should we
do with this image to deliver it to
different devices your first option is
to kind of cheat you can always deliver
a high resolution but low-quality
encoding everywhere that is give the
same image to all devices that's a
higher resolution a 2x image for example
but lower the quality in the JPEG
encoder to 20 rather than 90 this
typically can result in a 2x image that
will look better than an uncompressed 1x
image and you'll notice at the same time
it actually has a smaller file size
using this technique will work well in
many cases but it does come at a cost
the browser also needs to spend some
time decompressing the image and on a 1x
device it needs to scale the image by
50% to fit it into the available pixels
you can also start to see some color
banding in some gradients and using this
approach sure lower pixel count devices
will get a bigger image than they need
but not too much more data since its low
quality and higher pixel count devices
will get the right size although they
will get a slightly lower quality image
than they would normally want this
option isn't great but it's definitely
better than only serving low pixel count
art or serving only high pixel count art
to all devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
