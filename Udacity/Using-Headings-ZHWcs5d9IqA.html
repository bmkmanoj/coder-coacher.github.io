headings effectively to recreate the
experience we saw invictus video first
I'd like to reiterate Rob's point that
Dom automat is which is also item one
point three point two on the webbing
checklist Rob showed how it matters for
focus order but it also matters for the
order read by the screen reader in
Victor's demo you might have noticed how
the heading list followed the Dom order
and not the visual order of the page
that is actually true for screen readers
in general since the screen reader like
any assistive technology is interacting
with the accessibility tree which is
based directly on the Dom tree the order
a screen reader is going to perceive
will be directly based on the Dom order
think of the page is perceived by
desktop screen reader users at almost
losing its second dimension it's all
serialized into a single stream of
content I can use a little snippet of
JavaScript which you can copy from the
instructor notes to list out the
headings in the console I can use a
little snippet of JavaScript which you
can copy from the instructor notes to
list out the headings in the console we
have one h1 in this list telling us the
pages main topic this is also echoed in
the pages title in the header so when
switching tabs or Windows users know
what page they're on then we have a
series of h2s we'd include both page
structure things like contents as well
as article sections between some of
those 82's we also have h 3's indicating
subsections some of these are in the
article contents but some are also in
the surrounding page contents within
navigation menu there are things like
personal tools and languages this page
only goes down to h3 but we do have
built-in heading tags going all the way
down to h6 for very complex or long
documents using headings to layout page
structure like this is mentioned in
several webaim checklist items two point
four point 10 state individual sections
of content are designated using headings
where appropriate one point three point
one mentions semantic markup is used to
designate headings h1 two point four
point one mentions heading structure as
a sufficient technique for bypassing
blocks of content
and two point four point six discusses
some details for writing useful headings
if you are really watching closely
earlier you might have noticed that not
all of these headings are visible on
screen Wikipedia is using a technique
where they place some headings
off-screen to make them visible only to
screen reader users and other assistive
technology for complex applications this
can be a good way to accommodate
headings when the visual design doesn't
require or even at have room for a
visible heading however it's important
not to go overboard with this technique
remember that assistive technology uses
may well be able to see the screen so
going too far down the path of creating
screen reader only content can actually
create a worse user experience for some
users besides which it can create a
maintenance headache when it comes to
things like internationalization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
