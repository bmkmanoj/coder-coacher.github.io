complex creature using a wide variety of
hardware and communication protocols to
help make sense of it all most any
discussion of networking begins with a
notion of inner connection layers an
idea that captures the most important
relationships among the Internet's
components several attempts have been
made to formalize these most notably the
seven-layer OSI model and the four layer
Internet Protocol suite we use a hybrid
model here and try to keep the
discussion intuitive the physical layer
refers to hardware that actually creates
and transmits the electronic and optical
signals as well as the protocols for
interpreting these signals as bits this
would include the network interface card
inside your computer the modem that your
internet service provider gave you or
recommended that you buy the ethernet
cable connecting your modem to your
computer and even submarine fiber optic
cables that stretch across the world's
oceans protocols for interpreting the
signals sent across these media include
physical Ethernet and sauna the link
layer govers the communication between
peers on a local network the most
trivial topology for a local network is
just point to point where there is a
permanent link between two endpoints we
can also have more complex topologies
however where multiple nodes are all
connected to the same medium and feel
all each other signals the challenge
here becomes making sure that they don't
all talk at the same time the link layer
also encompasses switching where
connections between nodes are made on an
as-needed basis to reduce the potential
for crosstalk the network layer is
responsible for end-to-end communication
on the Internet when you request a page
from the Udacity website the data
doesn't come directly from our servers
because through several intervening
machines this process of routing the
data or figuring out what path the data
should take belongs to the network layer
unlike other layers which have evolved
to include many different technologies
the network layer is governed almost
exclusively by the Internet Protocol and
the system of IP addresses then once
data reaches your machine there has to
be some way of knowing which application
it is intended for also communication
isn't perfect so we need some mechanism
for detecting when data goes missing
arrives out of order or when the
connection is overloaded coping with
these situations is the job of the
transport layer and lastly at the
highest level we have the application
layer
which includes application specific
protocols such as HTTP for web SMTP for
mail etc the relationship between these
layers is mostly one of using the link
layer uses the physical layer to
accomplish its goal of enabling
point-to-point communication across a
shared medium the network layer uses the
link layer to accomplish its goal of
end-to-end communication between two
machines on the Internet the transport
layer uses the network layer to
accomplish its goal of reliable
end-to-end communication between
applications and the application layer
uses the transport layer to accomplish
its goal whatever it may be whether it's
fetching a website sending an email or
streaming a movie the plan for this
lesson will be to start at the bottom
layer and move our way up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
