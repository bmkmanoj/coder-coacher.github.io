Cooper natives is to use the coop CTL
run command let's use the KU CTL run
command to launch a single instance of
the inch next container as you can see
Cooper neighs has created what is called
a deployment well explain more about
deployments later but for now all you
need to know is that deployments keep
our pots up and running even when the
nodes they run on fail in Coober
Nettie's all containers run in West
called a pod use the coop CTL get pods
command to view the running engine next
container now that the engine s
container is running we can expose it
outside of cabernet days using the coo
CTO expose command so what just happened
behind the scenes karuna has created an
external load balancer with a public IP
address attached to it any clan who hits
that public IP address will be routed to
the pods behind the service in this case
that would be the engine next pod so if
we list our services now we'll see that
we have a public IP that we can use to
hit the engine s container remotely and
there you go karuna supports an
easy-to-use workflow out of the box
using the coup CTL run and expose
commands now that you've seen a quick
tour of Coober Nettie's is time to dive
into each of the components and
abstractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
