function and what is it actually in here
that causes the input what is it that
causes mystery tests fail well we can
again use delta debugging to figure this
out use our implementation of delta
debugging i'm going to extend this such
that the test now comes as a parameter
and then we can invoke the demon with an
appropriate test just as we like and i'm
going to invoke d demon with this input
for which you already know that it
causes mystery test to fail and then
passing mystery test as a parameter any
so let's see what's in here that causes
mystery test to fail press on run we
press on run and we see a single
character a single dot suffices a single
dot suffices to cause mystery test to
fail so what we have here is classical
setting first we use a fast tester to
test a program and we will repeat and
repeat this until the program breaks
then we feed this into Delta debugging
which again runs the program again and
again until we get a minimal failing
input such as a single dot such minimal
fairly inputs are very important as it
comes to convincing other people to fix
it bug suppose your program if testing
is a huge SQL server suppose you use a
first tester to deter it extremely long
and complex equal Curie's that you send
to the sequel server and then a sequel
server is going to choke on one of these
super super complex inputs and then you
say to the sequel developers hey I have
this very very long and complicated
sequel query and I can use this to break
the server what the developers are going
to tell you huh a big query like this
one never ever happens in practice so
maybe this will crash our server but
it's really not the top priority right
now we'd rather care about real queries
thank you very much so what you do then
is you run this big big complicated
query through delta debugging which then
we'll give you some minimal failing
input which now will be way way smaller
and actually look like something so
simple that it can actually happen in
practice and all of a sudden a sequel
developers will take you there
very seriously because all of a sudden
this looks like something that could
happen in practice true story from
