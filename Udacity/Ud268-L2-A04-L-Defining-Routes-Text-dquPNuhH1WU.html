routes and see how they're implemented
in Sinatra application we have very sad
empty Sinatra apt right now so let's see
how we add some logic every route we
define is looking to match two key
pieces of information the first is the
type of HTTP request that is coming in
so the HTTP verb is it a get request is
it a post request or is it something
else and the second key piece of
information is the actual path that the
user is requesting so is the user making
a request to slash sign in or 2 / sign
out or is the use of requesting / inbox
or / in box / starred so those two key
pieces of information the verb the
request and the request path itself are
what will match in our route so let's
revisit some of the Udacity com routes
that we played around with earlier to
get the homepage we have to make a get
request to the path / so the verb is get
that's the first piece and then the path
is / and it's important that / is
relative to the base URL which in this
case is Udacity com but for us when
we're in development it will be
localhost four five six seven so when
you make this request the logic on the
Udacity com back-end responds with the
home page content likewise when we make
a get request to the path / nanodegree
there's a route on the back end that
decides to respond with the nanodegree
programs page so enough of all this
conceptual stuff let's dive into the
actual syntax how do we define a route
using Sinatra well it looks like this so
here's Ruby code and the first bit is
the verb of the request so most of the
time get or post then the second part is
the path as a string so / nanodegree or
often just slash then do an end and then
inside of here where I have a comment
that's where you'll put the code that
actually is executed when a request
matches these two key pieces of
information the verb and the path so
let's take a look at a few examples this
code here will only be executed when a
get request is made to the path / about
here's another one this code again it's
just a comment that doesn't do much but
whatever we have here will be executed
when a post request is made to slash log
in and here's one more when a get
request is made to slash nanodegree
we'll run this code so hopefully you see
this pattern here a verb a path as a
string do an end and in between is where
we actually put the code that will
execute so what that code looks like
varies drastically depending on your
application but this syntax and this
pattern stays pretty much the same
throughout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
