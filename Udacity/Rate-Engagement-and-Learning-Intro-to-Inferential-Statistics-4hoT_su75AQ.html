we're trying to decide if me singing a
song that I wrote about hypothesis
testing is going to increase your
engagement and learning in the last
example confidence intervals were really
great when we were trying to estimate
the actual population parameters for
example the engagement ratio from our
example before in this case the
dependent variable so the engagement
ratio makes sense by itself we
understand what that means the number of
minutes students spend watching the
course to the total amount of minutes
that are available but in this case your
self-reported measures of engagement and
learning aren't as well defined and
they're subject to your individual
perceptions of what good engagement and
learning are obviously higher numbers
like nines and tens are better but what
does it really mean if you report your
engagement is seven in this case we
don't care as much what the actual score
between one and ten will be we just want
to see if the intervention or the song
possibly has an effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
