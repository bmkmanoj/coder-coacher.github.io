in practice I'll make a robot with two
parts to its arm a forearm and an upper
arm this is kind of a classic computer
graphics example except that my robot is
going to be a t8 50 the forearm is this
piece made of six objects I run some
tests on it and it looks good I've made
it so that the point where i'll attach
it to the upper arm is at the origin I
do this because I know that when a
rotation is applied the rotation happens
with respect to the point at the origin
here's the code to create my forearm
there's not a lot to it I create an
object 3d I call create robot extender
and then I add the forearm to the scene
so I can see it my create robot extender
function adds a bunch of geometric
objects to the forearm object if a
length is passed into let this function
know how tall to make the extender it
doesn't really matter what I add to the
forearm object the only rule is that
whatever I put into this object I need
to remember that this object will itself
rotate around the origin I designed my
upper arm in the same way and code it up
about the same again it rotates around
the origin the bit were interested in is
how these two objects get hooked
together so that the forearm is the
child of the upper arm here's the code
that attaches the two objects together
we make the two arm pieces the same as
before the key difference is that
instead of adding the forearm to the
scene itself we add the forearm to the
upper arm we also move the forearm to be
at the top of the upper arm at this
point the upper arm can be moved around
rotated scaled and all of its parts will
be transformed in the same way this is
why i rename this object to be the arm
instead of the upper arm since in fact
it holds both the upper arm and the
forearm for example if we set a rotation
on the arm the whole object will rotate
what's important to realize here is that
the arm doesn't particularly know or
care what's inside any of its children
when I add the forearm to the arm the
forearm becomes just another part of the
arm no different than adding a simple
sphere or a block however since we can
manipulate any object by changing its
transforms we can also change the
position of the forearm itself so
changing the angle with this line of
code will change the angle of the
forearm without affecting anything else
the transform order is the forearms
rotation and translation followed by the
arms rotation and translation this means
the four
can be transformed however you wish
without knowing about the arm as a whole
the arms transforms are applied later
give the demo a try to see how the two
parts interact with their separate
controls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
