than trying to sequence a whole genome
and compare it to something else but
still random sampling can have its own
disadvantages for example let's try a
random sample from a random page of my
genome book where we just take one
letter from the random page we can turn
the page and take another letter and
then turn the page and take another
letter and keep doing this over and over
and over again but what if we do this
for lots of people and find that most of
the regions we sample show no difference
at all we could have compared genomes
from all over the planet and not seen a
single difference because all human
genomes are already over ninety-nine
percent identical so the key is to
sample in regions where we know there's
going to be some variability and of
course this is when our single
nucleotide variants or snv's are really
going to come in handy personal genetics
companies like 23andme don't just
randomly sample the genome they're
actually going to take a million
individual letters of the genome snv's
to be precise regions were they know
even comparing closely related
individuals they'll expect to see some
differences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
