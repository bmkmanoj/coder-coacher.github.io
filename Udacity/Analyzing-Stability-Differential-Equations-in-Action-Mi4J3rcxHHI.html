solve the partial differential equation
the heat equation that is is
professionally called a finite
difference scheme because we're forming
differences of values that sit in finite
distances not infinitesimal distances
diagrammatically what we are doing looks
like this may using the current value of
our current position and the current
value to its left and the current value
to its right to estimate the next value
at our current position there are other
ways for doing this this is the most
simple but obviously it leads to
instability and the previous quiz we saw
that this scheme has a particular issue
with this sort of function a function
that oscillates up and down with each
step in space so let's compute what
happens with this very function assume
that this is our initial distribution of
temperature temperature at time 0
depending on X of course physically
speaking negative temperatures won't
make sense and particularly are not
without a unit of measurement but now
we're doing a little mathematics now
let's compute what's going to be the
next temperature at X equal to 0 the
result of the first step the temperature
at time h/h is the step size and
position 0 will be its form of air you x
0 and position 0 plus step size times
the rate of change and the rate of
change is thermal diffusivity times the
second derivative with respect to X
which we estimate one over Delta x
squared the old temperature to the left
minus Delta X plus the old temperature
to the right plus Delta X minus 2 times
the old temperature at zero so what's
that going to be the old temperature at
position 0 equals 1 same here the old
temperature to the left equals minus 1
and that to the right is minus 1 as well
this is one minus one minus one minus
tool which makes minus four step size
times thermal diffusivity divided by
delta x squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
