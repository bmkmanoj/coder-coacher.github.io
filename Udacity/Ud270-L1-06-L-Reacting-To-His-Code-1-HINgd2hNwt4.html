make a new page you've been copying
quote from other pages and then just
changing parts of it yeah it seemed
faster at the time I didn't realize
things got busy I was wondering out of
time so it's really not good practice to
be having a lot of repeated code it can
actually make things take a lot longer
so see here this HTML is repeating on
every page you also call the api in
almost every page and you have all this
complex Ruby code mixed into the HTML I
can definitely see why it's taking a lot
longer to make these changes even
something as simple as changing an API
endpoint or changing some Ruby hashes is
going to take you quite a bit of time it
would've been better if you'd kept the
code that interacts with the data source
completely separate from the code that
is responsible for the layout of the
page and then you can basically make
templates where you plug the data into
hey you know what have you heard of MVC
no Alan so NBC is a design pattern
designed to solve some of the same exact
problems that you seem to be
experiencing it's based off of
separation of concerns the idea that you
want to completely separate your code
based off the responsibilities that they
have okay well slow down okay what is
the design pattern and why would I want
to use one anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
