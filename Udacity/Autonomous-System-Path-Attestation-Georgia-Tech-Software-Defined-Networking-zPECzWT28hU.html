spam or unwanted commercial email now
you might not think that you receive a
lot of spam but the fact of the matter
is that most of it goes to your spam
folder so one might think what's the
problem well in fact spam remains a
scourge for network operators in
particular someone has to design the
filters that separate the good traffic
from the bad traffic additionally even
if email is classified as spam if it's
accepted for delivery the internets mail
protocols dictate that the server has to
keep the mail because it's told the
receiver that it has accepted the mail
this creates the potential for spam to
consume a significant amount of storage
space on email servers finally spam can
create security problems for users who
receive spam emails if the spam messages
contain a payload that could be harmful
such as malware or a phishing attack or
an attempt to steal a user's private or
sensitive information such as a password
now even though you don't see the mail
because of these filters something like
ninety five percent of all email traffic
is spam some reports from the
anti-phishing working group suggest that
something like one in every 87 emails
was a phishing attack and there's
something like 50,000 unique phishing
attacks in a month a common approach for
getting rid of spam messages is to
filter in other words prevent the
message from reaching the users inbox in
the first place now this begs the
question of how to differentiate spam or
the bad messages from ham or the
legitimate messages there are three
different ways to construct filters one
is content-based in other words you can
look at what's being said in the mail
for example if the mail contains
particular words such as viagra or Rolex
a content-based filter might pick up on
those terms and decide to filter the
mail 2nd a filter might make a decision
about whether an email message is spam
or ham based on the IP address of the
sender this method is often called
blacklisting third we can construct
filters based on behavioral features or
how the mail is sent so for exam
able if the mail is sent at a particular
time of day or if it's sent in a batch
of emails that are all roughly the same
size then we may be able to figure out
that a message is likely spam simply
based on the sender's sending behavior
now each of these approaches are
complementary but content-based
filtering and IP based filtering each
have problems contact based filters are
relatively easy for attackers to evade a
recent large commercial male operator
recently told me that he saw something
like eighty thousand different spellings
of Viagra but additionally messages can
be carried not only in text but in
images Excel spreadsheets or even mp3s
or movies therefore spammers can easily
alter the features of an emails content
and adjust those features and change
them to evade content-based filters on
the flipside those maintaining the
filters suffer a relatively high cost
because the filters must be continually
updated as content changes and the means
of carrying a content becomes more
sophisticated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
