inter-domain routing business models so
the one thing to remember about inter
domain routing is that it's really all
about routing money let's consider this
a s that wants to send traffic to a
particular destination well in the
internet there are two different types
of business relationships a customer
provider business relationship where
money flows from customer to provider
regardless of the direction that traffic
flows the other type of business
relationship is a peering relationship
where Naas can exchange traffic with
another a s free of charge this is
sometimes also called settlement free
peering so already you can see given
three possible ways to reach the
destination this a s is first going to
prefer a route through its customer
because regardless of the direction of
traffic on this link money is always
flowing from the customer the peering
link is second most preferable because
it's free and the least preferable route
is through the provider because the a s
has to pay money every time it sends
traffic on this link this leads to the
basic rules of preference in inter
domain routing where customer routes are
preferred over P routes which are in
turn preferred over provider routes the
other consideration that an a s has to
make is filtering or export decisions in
other words given that n a s learns a
route from its neighbor to whom should
it riad ver ties that route to
understand filtering and export
decisions let's add a couple more a SS
to the graph let's add another peer and
let's add another provider let's call
this a s in the middle of the picture
Cox Communications this is P might have
smaller regional customers and it might
also by transit connectivity from other
providers now let's suppose that this a
s learns routes to a destination via its
customer its peer and its provider now
we already have established that it
would prefer the customer route so that
it can make money by sending traffic to
that destination but what about
filtering decisions well
routes that are learned from a customer
Cox of course would want to re-advertise
to everyone else because the more people
use that route the more money Cox makes
therefore a route that's learned from a
customer
gets advertised to everybody else on the
other hand a route that's learned from a
provider if it were actually selected
would of course only be advertised to
customers it wouldn't make any sense to
take a route like this and advertise it
to another provider the reason of course
is that money is flowing in the
direction of the providers so any route
that's learned from a provider would
never be advertised to another provider
because it would result in Cox
essentially becoming a transit provider
between two of its own providers and
paying them both for the privilege of
carrying that traffic so routes learned
from a provider would only ever be
advertised to other customers and
similarly routes from peers would only
be advertised to other customers not to
other peers or other providers
so to summarize inter-domain routing has
both ranking rules we're given multiple
choices Naas might prefer a customer
route over a period around and then
given that it's selected a particular
route from either a customer a provider
or a peer it makes different decisions
about where to re-advertise that route
to other neighboring guesses now as it
turns out if every a s in the internet
followed these rules exactly
then routing stability is guaranteed now
you might wonder isn't routing stability
guaranteed already and it turns out that
it isn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
