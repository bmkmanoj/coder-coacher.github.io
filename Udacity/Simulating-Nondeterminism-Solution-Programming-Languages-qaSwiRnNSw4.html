modifying code we built in lecture that
simulates deterministic finite state
machines to also simulate
non-deterministic finite state machines
so as a quick review what makes a
non-deterministic finite state machine
different the deterministic one one
thing is that a non deterministic state
machine may have epsilon transitions
which means transitions that don't
require any characters in the string and
are taken automatically the other
difference is that a non-deterministic
machine may have to output edges that
correspond to the same letter and this
qoj is diverging States
simulating a string on a machine the
machine can be in multiple states at the
same time and so that's really the key
what we're going to have to modify for
this problem since we were told
explicitly we do not have to worry about
the epsilon transitions the first thing
we may want to go over is the notation
in Python code for our machine in the
example you are given a dictionary edges
so the keys in our dictionary indicates
the state in our state machine and the
values are the other states to whom the
key has an outgoing edge labeled with
the second value in the tuple of the key
that may sound a bit confusing so let's
work through and draw a diagram for what
this Python description represents let's
say we always begin at state 1 which
will hold true for the remainder of our
examples so here we've been given at
state 1 we then have two outgoing edges
to states 2 &amp;amp; 3 and those are labeled
with the letter A from state 2 we have
one ongoing edge to state 2 labeled with
the letter A from safe three we have two
outgoing edges two three and four
labeled with the letter B and from four
we have one outgoing edge to state five
labeled with the letter C and lastly we
have our accepting States two and five
so we'll use the notation of a double
circle to indicate that it's an
accepting state and this is the finite
state machine that this description
represents so if you're little rusty on
your non-deterministic finite automata
let's go through an exam
pull string and see whether or not it's
accepted so let's say we have the string
ay-ay-ay
we start at state 1 from 1 we take the
letter A to both 2 &amp;amp; 3
we're in two places at the same time at
2 we take the letter A
back the two at 3 there are no
transitions for the letter A so in this
version of our simulation this
alternative dimension however you want
to think about it the finite state
machine has failed to accept the string
however we saw the other version of the
simulation we take the last a back the 2
and from here we've succeeded and by our
definition of the non-deterministic if
any path through the state machine
results in an accepting state then we
say this machine accepts that string ok
let's do this once more here we have the
string
abbc from a we go to two states 2 &amp;amp; 3
then we have the letter B from state 2
there's nothing we can do from States 3
we have two outgoing edges with B so
we're now at 3 &amp;amp; 4
oh and I forgot to include this last
state transition C which will come up in
a bit from 3 we take another B to both 3
&amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; from 4 there's no other take this
B 2 so we failed and lastly we have a
seat from state 3 there's nowhere to
take the C but from 4 we could take 2 c2
5 which is an accepting state so now you
hopefully feel pretty good
with stepping through a
non-deterministic finite state machine
now we have to actually answer the
question and that is to simulate it and
what we're going to do is pretty much
what we did by hand we're going to do it
recursively we're going to start from
the starting state and we're going to
take the first character and our string
and recurse on this state that that edge
leads to so at 1 we're going to take the
a and recurse on to 2 with the rest of
the string and on the 3 for the rest of
the string and if any of those
recursions those recursive calls comes
back true then we say beginning at state
one we return true and it's going to go
all the way back up
let's try writing that so here we have a
procedure the non-deterministic finite
state machine simulator I know that's a
mouthful and we take in four parameters
the string on which we're simulating
the current state the map of edges that
represents the state machine and lastly
a list of the accepting states so I
mentioned before we're going to do this
via recursion and one of the first
things you may want to think about when
the writing recursive procedure is your
base case so our base case is going to
happen when we have no more characters
left in our string so I have no more
characters were simply going to return
whether or not we are currently in an
accepting state and thanks to the nice
Python syntax that translates almost
exactly to the code otherwise we're
going to look at the first character in
our string if the current state has an
outgoing edge with the letter that's the
first character in the string we're
going to do a recursive call for each
edge so here I've written the code that
gets out the new state and the last
thing we need to decide is what to do
with what the recursive call returns and
as I said earlier we're going to return
true if any of the recursive calls that
we make return true if we go through all
this mess or if there wasn't an edge for
the current letter at our present state
we're going to return false and that's
the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
