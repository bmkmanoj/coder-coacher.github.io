and new ideas in this nanodegree because
you're going to see so many it means
we're just not going to be able to focus
on acquiring fluency because remember
fluency generally takes a really long
time to acquire and even one thing so
instead the goal is going to be to get
to ability in the most important topics
that are fundamental throughout
programming in addition you're going to
gain awareness of many topics and
through this combination of awareness
and ability you're gonna have the skills
to do amazing things as well as the
understanding of what you need to do
next depending on your own personal
goals maybe you want to make a webpage
maybe you want to get a jobs a front-end
developer right now you probably
wouldn't even know where to begin but at
the end of this nanodegree you have
enough ability and awareness to make
informed decisions but along the way you
will experience frustration frustration
happens whenever you do something in
which you're not fluent and in computer
programming it happens even if you are
fluent what this means is at some point
during this journey you're probably
going to have some thoughts thoughts
like why can't I get this or why won't
this work or why is this so hard for me
I know I had all of these thoughts and
everyone goes through them but it's not
frustration that's the real problem
frustration is inevitable the problem
happens when this frustration turns into
something worse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
