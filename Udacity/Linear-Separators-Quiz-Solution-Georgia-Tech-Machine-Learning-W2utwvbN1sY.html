we're going to attack it I think the way
that we attend that you attack the
previous ones where we're gonna ask kind
of systematically is the VC dimension
greater than equal to one two three four
bike by giving examples until we just
can't anymore so good so is the VCE
greater than equal to one
yes yes so what would that mean all we
need to do is provide a point I don't
know call it the origin and basically we
get to just pretend that it's like a
single point on a line with a VC
dimension of one and it's the same
argument we had before complies oh
that's a good way to say it just you
know just think about the x-axis itself
and we can label something
well actually it's simpler in a sense
because we can keep the line steady and
we can just flip which side is you know
by negating all the weights we can flip
which side is positive in which side is
negative and that gives us the two
labelings at that point right and make a
similar argument for VC of two so if the
two points were on a line then to do the
four different combinations we could so
write by putting that line to the left
we can label both of them positive
that's easy or we could label both of
them negative by flipping the weights
now we have to do the other two cases
where they have different labels so I'm
gonna recommend putting a blue line
between them it's a ten blue line yes
and you know the one on the right is
positive the one on the left is negative
or we can flip the weights and then flip
the signs yes and three is where we got
into trouble last time so let's let me
start off by giving us ourselves a clean
slate so this ran us into trouble in the
case of the intervals because we
couldn't do that case and it looks like
we're kind of hosed again right yeah we
are we're actually completely hosed
again if we do this so I'm going to say
that the problem is not with the
hypothesis space the problem is with the
hand that is drawing points on the
screen so that's you so here's my hand
is really depressed well I'm gonna make
your hand happier so I think it's right
that you can't separate this it and the
reason you can't separate is because we
have three points on the number line
and there's just sort of nothing to do
here just like we had before but we are
not restricted to the number line so I'm
going to recommend cheating and then
moving that point in the middle off the
number line so make a triangle stick it
up in the middle somewhere alright and
that gives us the ability to handle this
case now because we can just send our
slicey line this way put everything
below it as positive everything above it
is negative right now of course we still
by doing that we might have messed up
the other labeling so we should check to
make certain that we haven't we haven't
screwed anything up so we can we can
make the top - and the bottom plus
that's true and we could just by
flipping the weights we could make it
the top plus and the bottom - right
so that's good and then the question is
can we do everything else yeah I think
it's pretty clear right we could
definitely label them all positive or
all negative just by putting a vertical
line somewhere off to the left yeah and
I think it's actually easier this
because if you just think about vertical
lines mm-hmm then we really are back in
the one dimensional case right and and
we handled the other seven cases in the
one dimensional case really easily it
was just this this extra case that we
didn't know how to do and now we do we
just used that third dimension or the
second dimension even better fair enough
okay so the answer is yes I feel good
about that okay so that's good so we got
we got one two and three out of the way
so we know it's more powerful we know
that it's better this is this is kind of
nice so now the question is four so
thinking about it I think the answer is
no that would be nice but no we need it
we need a slightly better argument and I
think I think we can do that what we
need again what would be helpful is if
we had an example where we could say
okay here's a labeling that no matter
how you lay out the points you're going
to fail so in order for that to work we
need to try to use all the power of the
two dimensions so we don't fall in a
trap right if like we almost did with VC
three by making them collinear so why
don't you place four points in the plane
and make a kind of like a diamond shape
or square which is like it's a diamond
shape if you yes tilt your head a little
bit okay so I'm gonna tilt my head and
look at it so here's my argument now I
don't know this is quite right Michael
so so so help me out with it the reason
I don't think you can do four is because
we've only got lines to work with okay
so if you connect all the points all the
way all pairs of points the way they
always they can be connected so you know
draw the square on the outside and then
draw the two cross ones in the middle
does that make sense yeah it makes sense
but I'm not sure where we're going with
this okay so I'm not either so so so so
work with me so that's kind of all the
boundaries that you can imagine drawing
and the problem that I see here is that
because of the way that the the two
lines that the X and the interior of the
squares set up there's kind of no way to
label the ones on the other side of
those lines differently without crossing
them so that made no sense what I said
right so try putting the plus in the
upper left and bottom right and minus
for the other two so if you look at the
the two ones that are connected by the
line with the plus and the tools that
are connected by a line with the - they
cross each other right there's no way to
put a single line that will allow you to
separate out the pluses from the minuses
here yeah yeah exactly so in particular
anything that puts these two pluses on
the same side is going to either put one
- or the other - on that same side right
it has a very XOR kind of feel to it to
me yeah it does in fact it has an X it
does nobody that is true but I meant it
in a slightly different way which is if
you think about these four points as
actually being you know 0 0 1 1 0 1 and
1 0 then the label here is exactly X or
and XOR is one of these things that you
can't capture with a linear separator so
I think I think you got it that makes
sense so and and I think the important
thing here is that I like the XOR
argument or anything here is that no
matter where I move those four points I
can take the one closer or one farther
away and I could they're no larger
squares but that whatever I want to be
they're all you're always going to have
a structure where you can draw those
kind of crosses between the four points
or you're going to end up collapsing the
points on top of one another or making
three of them collinear or all four
them collinear and so that makes it even
harder to do any kind of separation
because now we're bright so you fail on
all those but there's there's one case
that I'm not sure that you quite
described yet like that right well I
think that that works out to be the same
thing right if you if you draw the
connecting lines together they're all
gonna cross at the middle point there's
no crossings they all cross at that
point they all meet at that point they
do well so those are line segments but
those lines those are just segments they
represent lines that go on forever
ah good point yeah so but the way the
way that I would see this one is again
just to give an example of a labeling
that just can't be separated would be
this one right if you capture the
outside points assigning all the outside
points one label you can't assign the
input the inside point a different label
it's inside the convex hull it's going
to have the same label as the other ones
exactly so the and I well so in my head
the the the main issue is as lines when
lines cross there's really nothing you
can do with the single line never cross
the streams yeah it still doesn't feel
like quite the same I mean maybe we're
belaboring this point here in this
square if you actually let this this
corner point pushed into the middle then
we can we can linearly separate them
sure so I feel like these are two
different cases but regardless the point
is that what we what we argued is no
matter how you lay out the points there
is always going to be a labeling that
can't be achieved in the hypothesis
class right yeah the whole crossing of
the lines thing really is about being
able to get all four points it's not
saying that any pair of points works out
ok so what you end up doing is taking
one of those points and dragging them
into the middle and then the lines all
meet like and what you've drawn and you
end up with the basically the same
argument I think it's the same thing but
I do agree with one thing Michael which
is that we are belaboring this point
because the good news or the the
exciting news is no we really argued
that the VC dimension of linear
separators is not greater than equal to
four so therefore it's three because
three works and four doesn't and three
is my favorite number so I have a
question for you Michael I noticed that
we keep getting in all the examples
we've done so far we keep getting one
more VC dimension so does this kind of
argument work if I went from planes to
or let say 2d space to 3d space or 40
space or 5e space if these
dimensions still three or does it keep
getting bigger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
