was to fill in the diagonals these
should all be zero unless there's a
negative cycle thankfully there's only
one negative path found so far and I can
easily check that it doesn't create a
negative cycle when we use for as an
intermediate vertex I could go from 3 to
4 that would cost negative 3 but going
back from 4 to 3 would cost 6 and so
then the overall cost would be 3 which
is greater than 0 0 is better next I
filled in the values where 4 was either
a source or a destination a sense vertex
4 can't help as an intermediate vertex
in those situations now for the
remaining entries the choices for going
from 1 to 3 are either to use the old
path which costs 4 or to go from 1 to 4
and then from 4 to 3 that cost 7 so the
old path is better how about going to 2
1
well there is no old path but there is a
path through 4 I could go from 2 to 4
that would cost 1 and then from 4 to 1
which would cost 2 more for a total of 3
that's good going from 2 to 3 was
impossible before but using vertex 4 I
can go to 2 for 4 cost of 1 and then for
2 for a cost of 6 more for a total of
seven three two one is another path
that's impossible without going through
4 but if I do go through 4 then going 3
to 4 costs negative 3 and going for 2 1
cost 2 for a total of negative 1
lastly we have that going from 3 to 2
used to cost 2 but we can improve on
that by going to 4 first which cost
negative 3 and then going from 4 to 2
which cost 1 for a total of negative 2
and that completes the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
