surprisingly I did not get the answer
they are the same here's what I got it
says first and second is Udacity so why
isn't it the same as third which is also
Udacity let me explain first and second
is a variable any object variable
contains a reference to the object like
this the string object contains the
letters Udacity let's look at our other
variable again a variable just holds a
reference now reference to which object
is it a reference to the same string
object or to a different one and that is
the key question the equal equal
operator checks whether the contents of
these two variables is exactly the same
in other words whether both variables
refer the exact same object now actually
they don't because if you remember what
happened first and second was obtained
by gluing together this string and that
string and a brand new object had to be
created to hold that content the third
string was initialized with the literal
string Udacity which came from elsewhere
so in this case the objects are
different but we don't actually care
about that what we care about is do they
have the same contents and to compare
the contents one has to use the equals
method and not the equal equal operator
let's do that over here I will check
whether first and second equals third
here is the test we call the equals
method on first and second and pass it
third as a parameter now when we run the
program it will work as expected the
program prints they are the same so the
takeaway is when comparing strings use
the equals method and not the equal
equal operator and as a reminder when
comparing decimal numbers be sure to
check whether the numbers are close to
each other and also don't use equal
equal now when do you use equal equal
for integers of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
