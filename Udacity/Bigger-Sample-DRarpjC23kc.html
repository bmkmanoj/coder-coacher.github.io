and it ranges from about 38 to 42 so
it's a lot smaller than the one we had
calculated when we were basing it off of
a sample of size 35 bigger samples give
us more precise estimates by giving us
smaller intervals because they shrink
the standard deviation of this sampling
distribution so they shrink the interval
in which a sample mean might feasibly
lie
now notice that this confidence interval
doesn't even contain the original
population mean 37.72 therefore it's
very unlikely that a random sample of
size 250 with a mean of 40 could have
been selected by chance this is evidence
for a treatment effect so with a bigger
sample size we have a smaller interval
for which we're pretty sure the true
population lies so with a 95% confidence
interval with the sample sizes being 35
we had a pretty big interval but with a
95% confidence interval with sample
sizes being 250 we had a much smaller
confidence interval the greater our
sample size the smaller our confidence
interval for the true population
parameter after the intervention and the
better we are able to estimate our
population parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
