api's can work within the same machine
but what this course is really going to
focus on is how api's can enable
communication between several machines
this is where web api is come into the
picture simply put web api is make it
possible to invoke the execution of code
on another machine via the internet a
machine can use multiple web AP is to
create a new application sometimes
called a mashup providing users with the
new experience that leverages existing
applications soon you'll be making a
mash-up of your own but why is all this
important and what do companies gain by
allowing their content to be accessible
via AP is by opening up code over the
Internet API providers are not only
helping other developers who want to use
their code but are also promoting their
own business AP is for social media
applications for example allow users to
share content logins and personalized
data between web applications gaining
popularity and giving users more
functionality with their accounts this
means more traffic and more users for
social media applications with publicly
available AP is so implementing
accessible web AP is isn't only just a
nice thing to do it's also a lucrative
investment for many companies and in
some cases a company's proprietary money
stream an example of a company that
depends heavily on its API is twilio a
cloud communications company that allows
developers to make and receive phone
calls and text messages using its web
service API twilio has free and paid
access versions of their api forming a
key revenue stream for the company check
out to leo's developer site and see all
of the features of their api</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
