your game and making it challenging but
not too challenging by adding goals and
obstacles what else can we do to keep
our players interested I know I'm
getting a lot better playing our
bouncing game by myself but I wish there
was some way I could know exactly how
good I am yeah it would be great to see
how we rank against other players let's
play against each other and add some
competition alright when plays compete
and have a chance to win our set a
record they have even more motivation to
keep coming back to your game let's see
some different ways that game apps
create competition one simple way to
create some friendly competition in your
app is to add a leaderboard which lists
the players with the highest scores or
achievements like in the game temple run
it lets players share their rank with
one another and lets you keep track of
the highest scores over the current day
the week and overall time another good
way to include competition is with
personal ratings like the star rating in
angry birds which is an example of a
personal player achievement it gives
players a number of stars one out of
three based on how well they beat the
level this gives them an idea of how
skilled they are at the game and if they
think they can do better they'll play
the game for a longer time and the more
time players spend in your game the more
money it will eventually be able to make
another way to get players to keep
coming back to your game is to offer
them special timed awards like really
cool items or mystery stages during a
specific time window this is also a
great strategy for getting players who
may have left your game to come back by
offering a special stage or reward you
keep your game exciting and interesting
for example puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons have urgent
dungeons that can only be played on a
specific day or within a limited time
frame like this dungeon can only be
played on a Thursday other games have
daily or weekly challenges and these
special timed events combined with
leaderboards and achievements create
exciting competition between members of
the gaming community and are all great
ways to keep players involved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
