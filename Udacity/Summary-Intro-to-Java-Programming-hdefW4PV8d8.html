shows two kinds of question a plain
question and a numeric question both of
them who are past to the present
question method clearly we can extend
the system with all sorts of other
question types and we won't ever have to
change the present question method so
what polymorphism gives us is extensible
software systems we can start out with
something simple and without having to
change any of the basic structure we can
extend the functionality by adding more
and more subclasses polymorphism is one
of the two cornerstones of
object-oriented programming the other
one is encapsulation remember that
encapsulation means we separate the
interface of a class from its
implementation and that means that the
implementations can evolve over time and
gain more functionality without having
to change the rest of the system so both
of these cornerstone properties let us
build systems that start out small and
that can be functional for a long time
which is why object-oriented programming
has become such a popular methodology
for writing programs learn a few short
weeks you have gone from just becoming
familiar with objects and how they work
to be able to write quite sophisticated
programs that can withstand the test of
time so you've really come a long way in
this introduction to programming and I
hope you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
