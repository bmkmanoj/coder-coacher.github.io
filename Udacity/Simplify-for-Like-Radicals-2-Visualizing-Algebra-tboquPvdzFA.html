you found in both of those first we
split up each of these numbers into two
factors we want to make sure that one of
the factors is the largest square number
that divides into it for the first one
we know the square root of 16 equals 4
and then we're left with multiplying it
by the square root of 3y we take the
square root of 4 to get 2 times the
square root of 3y and we take the square
root of nine to get three times the
skirt or through why be sure you keep
the signs the same as you work now we
have like terms since each one has a
square root of 3y we add 4 and 2 and
subtract 3 to get three times the square
root of 3y for the second problem we
start by splitting up eight into 4 times
2 and we split up 32 into 16 x 24 our
numbers we take the square root of 4
which equals 2 and this 2 stays inside
of our square root since it doesn't
appear twice as a factor for the
variables we want to remember power /
route we take the power of 2 and divide
it by 2 to get one this means X to the 1
appears outside of a radical for why
we'll do 3 divided by 2 because our
indexes of two here we know 3 divided by
an index of 2 equals 1 remainder 1 this
means 1 Y comes out and 1y stays in we
saw this before when we're simplifying
brutes earlier we use power divided by
root and this number indicates the power
outside of the radical where the
remainder indicates the power inside the
radical for our second radical we take
the square root of sixteen which equals
for the two stays inside of the square
root and now we need to simplify y to
the third power we use power divided by
root so 3/2 equals one remainder 1 so
we'll have 1y on the outside and 1y on
the inside we multiply the numbers
together in front of each radical to get
6x y times square root of 2y minus eight
X Y times the square root of 2y now we
subtract these two radicals we use 6 X Y
minus eight X Y to get negative 2xy
times the square root of 2y our final
result keep in mind there were two
reasons why we could subtract here we
subtracted because the radicals were
like and we subtracted because these
polynomial
or like terms we're really packing on
the algebra now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
