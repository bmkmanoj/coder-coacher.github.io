this section so it's time for you to
tell me what have we learned so this was
the section on general is generalizing
generalization and scaling right so we
connected that idea with function
approximation which is a section that I
did right so we talked about
generalization beyond function
approximation to function approximation
can be on function approximation and
beyond okay and what kind of
generalizations do we do so we did
temporal abstraction mm-hmm and in
particular we talked about temporarily
extended actions or sm dps well options
oh right right right and SMD peace and
what does smtp stand for semi Markov
decision just like the truck right a
semi Markov decision process exactly
such empty p with 18 wheels yes so we
learned about options and temporal
abstraction which is really cool and
what else i want to say that led us to
goal abstraction it did as a matter of
fact and in particular you remember
mediating between the different goals
competing goals we did and that had a
larger name we talked about modular
reinforcement learning oh right i should
remember that because i was alive when
phones were modular that was like a big
deal nobody was alive when phones were
modular Michael in any case one of the
things that we got hell i was like
before phones were modular and i was
alive when they switched to being
modular mm-hmm you're such a hipster
okay so we talked about modular RL or mr
ellis of cool kids call it and the words
you were searching for before I think
was arbitration arbitration it just
seems so arbitrary that's right we had
we talked about one other kind of
abstraction you might recall state
abstraction yeah we got some state
abstraction from the temporal
abstraction that's right but not only
did we get some state abstraction from
the temporal abstraction that is not
having to pay attention to all possible
all states for all particular options it
actually turns out that state
abstraction is sort of what function
approximation is doing ok all right yeah
yeah so I think it's pretty cool
was there anything else that we learned
I don't think so well we had a name for
at least temporal abstraction we should
at least mention that nothing else this
is a form of hierarchical and we talked
about quintessential search but I think
we actually met quiescence we did hmm
and what does quiescence mean quietness
right and in particular it means that in
the North erste it means that you don't
have to there's not all this crazy
search backtracking stuff happen anymore
things have settled down and you can
just you know exactly what the next
thing is going to be so everything is
settled right and once things are
settled then your models will not count
it against your search it has no more
sort of exponential hit on your search
you are forced we can treat it as almost
as if it's a single move say or a single
action because once you do this the next
thing I snap next things happen next
thing is happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
