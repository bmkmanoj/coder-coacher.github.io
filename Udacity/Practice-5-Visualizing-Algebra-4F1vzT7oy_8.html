equals 3 / 26 if you got the answer
right you are well on your way let's see
how we got that answer once again this
is an equation that has fractions in it
since I don't want to have to add and
subtract multiply and divide a lot of
fractions I can clear the fractions by
multiplying through by the least common
denominator the denominators are 6 2 &amp;amp; 3
the least common denominator is 6 so i
have to multiply the equation through by
6 i'm going to skip the step of showing
the individual multiplication of the
terms when i multiply 6 times X plus 7
over 6 the 6 is canceled out and i'm
left with x plus 7 when i multiply six
times one-half x 6 times one-half is
three and i have to multiply that by X
when I multiply six times two-thirds I
get 12 over 3 which is for remember when
we're multiplying through by the least
common denominator i have to multiply
the least common denominator by every
term and that's every term whether
there's a fraction in the term or not so
i also have to multiply six times 4x
which gives me 24 x now that i've
eliminated all the fractions from my
equation i can combine like terms on the
left side i only have X plus 7 and on
the right side i have 3x plus 24x is
going to give me 27 x and then i have
the plus for the next thing i want to do
since i like to deal with positive
coefficients is to subtract x from both
sides even though there's not a
coefficient in front of this X we know
that there's a 1 there so 1 x minus 1 x
gives me 0 and the only thing I have
left on the left side of the equation is
7 on the right side of the equation I
have 27 x minus 1 x gives me 26 x plus 4
now that my variable is on one side of
the equation I want to isolate it by
subtracting 4 from both sides of the
equation 7 minus 4 is 3 and that equals
26 x the last step is to divide both
sides of the equation by the coefficient
of the variable which is 26 when I do
that I know 26 / 26 is 1 so i have x on
the right side of the equation and 3 /
26
on the left side of the equation
remember it doesn't matter whether you
have a number equals x or x equals a
number it's the same thing
congratulations on completing solving
linear equations now that you've learned
how to solve linear equations let's do
something a little bit different Chris
what do you have up for us next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
