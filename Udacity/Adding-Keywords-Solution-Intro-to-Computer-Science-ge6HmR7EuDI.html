table add we're going to define the
procedure hash table add so the first
thing we want to do is find the right
bucket will use hash table get bucket
that we just defined to do that passing
in the table and the key will store that
in the variable bucket the next thing we
need to do is add the new key value pair
and we can do that using a pen append
will add a new element to the list and
what we want the list to be is a new
list with two elements the key and the
value so let's try this in the Python
interpreter and I've done essentially
the same thing that we did before except
for we don't really need the variable
bucket we can do the append right away
so i'm getting the bucket and then I'm
appending the new entry to it so we'll
start we'll make a hash table and we'll
keep the size of the hash table very low
we would never really want a hash table
with only three buckets but to make it
easy to look at the results will keep
the hash table very small and let's add
to our table a kien value and for our
actual web index the values will be list
of URLs for our tests they could be
anything so let's just use a number and
now we can look at table and let's run
that and we see we have the table we
have three buckets and one of the
buckets contains an element if we look
at the bucket that we get from hash
table get bucket for the key Udacity we
should get the bucket that contains the
keyword Udacity let's try that that
works and we can add some more words to
our hash table more key value pairs to
our hash table so now we've got three
entries in our hash table they all
happen to end up in different buckets
that's just lucky in this case let's add
one more so we have a bucket that
contains more than one entry and we
should print our table after adding one
more and now we have one bucket with one
word one bucket with two entries and one
bucket with just one now there's one big
problem with the way we did hash table
add suppose we add the same word again
and let's say now the value of Udacity
is 27
so now we're making a hash table that
has three buckets we're adding a bunch
of entries into it we've added the entry
Udacity twice now when we get the bucket
for Udacity what we see is we have a
bucket that has the same keyword twice
if we want our hash table to be a
mapping between keys and values this is
going to be a problem if we have the
same keyword twice when we look up
Udacity well we don't know which answer
we should get is the value 23 or is the
value 27 so what we want is something a
little different from add what we want
is to make sure that every time we add a
new keyword to the hash table if it
already exists instead of having two
entries with the same keyword what we'll
do is change the value that's associated
with that keyword so we have a problem
if we have two entries with the same
keyword we're going to fix that later
before we fix that let's define look up
and it will turn out that look up will
actually be helpful in defining a better
version of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
