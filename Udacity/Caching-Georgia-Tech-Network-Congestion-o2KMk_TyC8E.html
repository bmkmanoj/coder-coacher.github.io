cache parts of a web page caching can
occur in multiple places your browser
can cache some objects locally on your
very machine caches can also be deployed
in the network
sometimes your local ISP may have a web
cache and later we'll also look at how
content distribution networks are a
special type of web cache that can be
used to improve performance to see how
caching can improve performance consider
the case where the origin web server may
host the content for a particular
website but it's particularly far away
now we already know that TCP throughput
is inversely proportional to round-trip
time so the further away that this web
content is the slower the webpage will
load both because latency is bigger and
because throughput is lower if instead
the client could fetch content from the
local cache performance could be
drastically improved by fetching content
from a more nearby location caching can
also improve the performance when
multiple clients are requesting the same
content in this case not only do all of
the local clients benefit from the
content being cached locally but the ISP
also saves costs on transit because it
doesn't have to pay to keep transferring
the same content over these expensive
links instead it can simply serve the
content to the clients locally to ensure
that clients are seeing the most recent
version of a page caches periodically
expire content based on the expire
center that we already saw caches can
also check with the origin server to see
whether the original content has been
modified if the content has not been
modified the origin server would respond
to a cache check request with a 304 or a
not modified response clients can be
directed to a cache in multiple ways one
is with browser configuration so you can
open your browser and explicitly
configure the browser to point to a
local cache
so that all HTTP requests first are
directed through the local cache before
the request is forwarded to the origin
in the second approach the origin server
or the service hosting the content might
actually direct your browser to a cache
this can be done with a special reply to
a DNS request we can see these effects
for example when we do a DNS lookup for
google.com the response returns a number
of IP addresses and when I ping the IP
address we see that the resulting IP
address is only one millisecond away
which indicates that that server is not
far away but is in fact very likely on
the local network probably even the
Georgia Tech campus network in this case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
