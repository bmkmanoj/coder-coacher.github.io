so consider the sentence Ashok made
pancakes with David with a girl I am
sure you understood the meaning of this
sentence almost immediately but what did
you understand what is the meaning of
meaning we can do several different
kinds of analysis on this sentence we
can do lexical analysis which will
categorize each of these words into
different lexical categories for example
of sugars a noun
made is a verb pancakes as a noun and so
on we can do syntactic analysis in terms
of the structure of this particular
sentence so you might say Ashok is a
noun phrase made pancakes for David with
a griddle is a verb phrase and this
particular verb phrase itself has sub
phrases in it or we can do semantic
analysis on this and say that Ashok was
the agent made was the action pancakes
were the object that got made David was
the beneficiary and griddle was the
instrument the knowledge base area
approach to understanding stories like
this semantic analysis is at the
forefront syntactic analysis and lexical
analysis will serve semantic analysis so
here are some of the semantic categories
in terms of which we can classify the
different words in the sentence so
Ashoka is an agent maid is an action or
verb in a lexical sense
pancakes are a somatic object things
that are getting made and so on the
frame for representing understanding of
this sentence has the verb or the action
make the agent Ashok and so on
just like we just discussed this then is
the meaning of meaning this is what the
air agent understands when it
understands the meaning of the sentence
this is perhaps also what you understand
when you understanding meaning of the
sentence how do we know that you
understood the meaning of this sentence
when we know that because I can ask you
some questions and you can draw the
right kind of inferences from it so for
example given the sentence I can ask you
well who ate the pancakes and you might
be able to say well David 80 pancakes
because Ashok may depend cakes for David
notice that this information about who
ad pancakes was not present in this
particular Center this is an inference
you are drawing this is a very similar
to what we had encountered earlier when
we had sentence like Ashok ate a frog at
that time to wait ask questions
well was I shocked happy at the end and
the frame had some default values which
said a shocked was probably happy or was
the Frog dead at the end and a frame for
eating had some default value which said
that the Frog was dead at the end so
according to this theory the meaning
lies in the inferences we can draw from
it you understand the meaning of this if
we can draw the right inferences we do
not understand the meaning of this if we
cannot draw the right inferences or if
we can draw only the wrong inferences
this frame representation of the meaning
of this particular sentence allows you
to draw the right inferences given the
action make here the thematic world
pertains to the relationship of various
words in the sentence to this particular
action of making a showcase the agent
David is a beneficiary and so on so far
we have described the meaning of this
sentence and how we can capture that
meaning in this frame we have not yet
described a process by which this
knowledge is extracted out of that
sentence the extraction of the meaning
of the sentence is exactly the topic
that we will discuss next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
