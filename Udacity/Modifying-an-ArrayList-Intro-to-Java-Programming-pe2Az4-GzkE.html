and traversing arraylists
but what if you want to modify the
contents you know how to get an element
and if you want to change it you use a
very similar method the set method so
over here we're calling set with an
index and the new value whatever was
there before at position two is now
replaced with this new value in the next
exercise you will see a couple of lines
of code involving getting set that try
to swap two pictures in our gallery but
when you run it you'll see it's not
working your job is to fix it here's the
bad code let's see what's bad about it
when you run the program then the
gallery looks like this clearly it's not
swapping the pictures at position one
and two instead there seems to be a gap
here let's first of all understand that
gap before we go and fix it here is the
original gallery let me write the index
values so it makes it easier to follow
along what happens now we're taking the
element at position one that's this
fellow here and now we're setting this
one here to this picture so now over
here this element is also that same guy
pardon my drawing skills obviously I'm
not Google and now what do we do here we
get that's this fellow again and put him
into slot one so what we would expect is
to see him twice maybe except remember
that what we're having in the ArrayList
are not objects but object references so
here's what the ArrayList really looks
like the zero slot has a reference to
this object the one and two slot have a
reference to the exact same object and
then the three and four point to these
ones and I won't draw those arrows the
point is that these ones are the exact
same object and so it's drawn twice but
you don't see that because it gets drawn
on top of itself the gap was just an
artifact of the positioning never mind
the gap
what's important is that if you first
copy this one over here you wipe out the
element that's in here and then when you
copy back then you just get two
identical values in the array that's no
good so what we need to do is instead of
wiping out the bridge here at
- we need to save it let's do that here
we're saving the old value at slot -
then we can set slots - to what we want
and now here instead of using the new
value we'll use the old one
now go ahead and run this and you'll see
that the elements and 1 &amp;amp; 2 are swapped
here you see them get in set are
certainly the most basic operations on
an array list but there are a bunch of
others that are also quite convenient
let's have a look at those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
