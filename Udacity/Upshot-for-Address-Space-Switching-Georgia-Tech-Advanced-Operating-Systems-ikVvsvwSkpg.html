is you have to really ask the question
are we switching between small
protection domains are large protection
domains if you are switching between
small protection domains then by taking
advantage of whatever the hardware gives
you you can make the switching between
these small protection domains efficient
by careful construction of the services
on the other hand if the switch is from
one large protection domain to another
large protection domain the switching
cost the explicit cost of switching from
one Hardware address space to a
different Hardware address space is not
that significant because the loss of
locality when you go from a large
protection domain to another large
protection domain both in terms of TLB
misses that are going to happen when you
start executing in the new large
protection domain for translations as
well as the cache effects that the fact
that your cache is not going to be warm
with the data and the instructions for
the new protection domain that cost is
much more significant than just the
switching cost going from one large
protection domain to another large
protection domain so this is the way the
address space switching myth is debunked
by the l3 microkernel by construction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
