tea-table we can use the tea table for
an interval estimate for our p-value but
we can't use it to find the exact
p-value since our sample has eight
values we have seven degrees of freedom
and our T statistic is in between 0.896
and 1.1 1 9 that means the upper tail of
our p-value would be between point 15
and point 20 and so would the lower tail
of our p-value which means that our
total p-value would be between 0.3 0.5
teen plus point 15 and point four 0.2
plus point 2 but we don't need to be
able to do it by hand or with a table
because these days we can use software
there's a website called graph pad the
link is below and use that to calculate
what this p-value is and you should find
that it's between point three and point
four navigate to statistical
distributions and interpreting p-values
and then based on the fact that we're
doing a two-tailed test and we know our
t-test statistic figure out the rest
what did you get for the two-tailed
p-value is this statistically
significant or not statistically
significant and that's because of which
of these options
therefore what's our decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
