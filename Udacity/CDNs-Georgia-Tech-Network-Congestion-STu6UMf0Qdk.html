content distribution networks or CDN
well first talk about what a CDN is and
why a content provider might want to use
one well then talk about how server
selection works in CDNs and how clients
get redirected to the right server so
first of all what is a content
distribution network it's an overlay
network of web caches that's designed to
deliver content to a client from the
optimal location now in many cases
optimal means geographically closest but
sometimes optimal is not the
geographically closest cache and we'll
see some examples of when that's the
case CD ends are made of distinct
geographically disparate groups of
servers where each group can serve all
the content on the CDN these CD ends can
often be quite extensive here is a
global map depicting the deployment of
the Google cache servers around the
world as mapped in a recent project by
researchers at the university of
southern california as you can see these
web caches can be quite extensive and in
many cases there's a concerted effort to
place caches as close as possible to
users some CDNs are owned by content
providers such as Google and others are
owned and operated by networks such as
level-3 limelight and AT&amp;amp;T
still others such as Akamai operate
independently non network CDNs such as
Akamai and Google can typically place
servers in other autonomous systems or
ISPs the number of cache nodes in a
large content distribution network can
vary for example in the Google Network
the USC researchers found that there
were about 30,000 unique front and cache
notes as of about two years ago the
Akamai edge platform reported about
85,000 unique caching servers in nearly
1,000 unique networks around the world
in 72 countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
