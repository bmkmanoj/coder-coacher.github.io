Salem and I'm here with CEO and founder
of Catania health Cory Kidd Cory how are
you I'm doing well thanks great so Cory
can you tell me a little bit about
Catania health sure so Catania help is a
health care company that's about two and
a half years old we focus on chronic
care management for patients now we
happen to do that using an interactive
robot and artificial intelligence so we
have a solution that is focused on
solving real challenges that patients
have but doing that not for a small
group of patients but something that can
scale to a large number of patients you
tell me a little bit about your
background please and how you guys
started in healthcare so I've been
working in healthcare technology for
about 20 years now
I started off 20 years ago at Georgia
Tech doing an undergrad degree in
computer science focused in really on
healthcare applications of that ended up
actually by the time I finished my
undergrad degree being hired as research
faculty helped build a research lab
focused on what we now call Aging in
place a lot of different technology in
the home environment for people to be
able to live at home longer rather than
move into a nursing home or assisted
living facility in 2001 when I went back
to grad school ended up going to MIT to
the Media Lab I wanted to stay in that
broad space of healthcare technology but
start you know playing with a new fun
cutting-edge technology at that point
the the idea of social robots are
interact interactive robots was very new
there been a few of them built at that
point in time I thought they might have
some promise in this space so ended up
spending a couple of years doing some of
the studies around the site basic
psychology of interaction and what that
led into is now what I've been doing for
the last 15 16 years in seeing that okay
this works really well when we care
about long-term engagement with people
there's this huge set of problems in
healthcare that we need to solve around
engagement let's put these two things
together and so my work is iteratively
then applied that in
two new areas of healthcare as we've
continued to evolve and adapt the
technology to support that can you
explain to me a little bit about human
robot interaction and why it's important
in robotics sure so I mean human robot
interaction as a field is pretty broadly
defined you know you've got robots and
people interacting with one another in
terms of like academic tradition it
comes out of field mostly of
human-computer interaction which in turn
comes from psychology so for me and a
lot of the work I've done over the last
15 16 years in human robot interaction a
lot of that comes back to how do we as
people interact with one another and
what of that can we apply in the world
of technology this particular technology
typically takes a form that can look at
us maybe talk to us maybe roam around in
our spaces so why do you feel that
that's important that we have a
technology that can kind of interact
with us and kind of work closely with us
and building that bond between that
technology I think it really depends on
the application right obviously you know
as as humans we've built technology for
a very long time right it's something
that we do and you've got a lot of
technology now that is getting more and
more complex and doing things in the
same physical spaces as us right and so
part of that main stuffs moving around
around us
many of these take the form of robots or
some other automation right so the word
robot robot is not necessarily very
clearly defined right so we could think
about a lot of things that we interact
with today or that we imagine that we're
going to be interacting in the next few
years so they're gonna share space with
us and we need to know what that means
right when this stuff is you know in our
environments and our offices in our
homes in other places where we're going
to interact with it understanding how
that's going to work so that this
technology is to our benefit and not our
detriment it's very important right so
that's a very broad thing very
deliberately in terms of you know how we
think about this the kinds of things
that we're building but I think that's a
lot of what human robot interaction as a
field of study is about right
understanding how do we solve these
problems in a way that benefit us as
humans in terms of using this technology
what kind of studies are you aware of
that have kind of taken place in this
area that really kind of started to
drive this movement we're kind of like a
focal point that people started saying
hey we really need to kind of you know
focus a lot more on this aspect
of how people interface with machines
and not necessarily just that the
machine is here and it's gonna do a job
and we really don't care about how it
ties in socially right so I mean there
are thousands of studies in human robot
interaction that have been done over the
last two decades and that really builds
on the field of human-computer
interaction where you've got many many
more studies going back for about a half
a century now probably even longer so
you know it's a field that people have
thought about for a long time and it's a
lot of different aspects to these
studies some of them are are you know
very broad and trying to understand you
know you put robots into a particular
environment how do people interact or
react some of them are very specific all
right so so getting down to some of the
details you know we have a mobile robot
say they can move around how close can
it come to you and you're still
comfortable right so very similar to you
know interpersonal space we're a few
feet apart right now all right this
would be a bit different if we were
right up close to next to one another
right new you see you start to feel
awkward when I get into your face same
kind of thing with robots right is it
the same as with us right is you know
six inches too close with a robot
definitely is if you know we were
talking six inches apart three feet
though this feels about right is it the
same with the robot so you've got a
whole range of things and you can
imagine all different aspects of
interpersonal interaction right with
other people how do we apply those in
the world of technology specifically in
the world of robotics so there's this
whole body of literature again looking
at the very broad things right robots in
particular situations or how do they
help us in education or healthcare or
entertainment do the very specific you
know if a robot does this particular
action or says this thing or you know
makes this sound or write these very
specific pieces there are a lot of
studies around that as well now doesn't
mean that the field is done right
there's so much more that we have to
understand for a couple of reasons one
is there are perhaps an infinite number
of those types of questions that we can
answer right we can keep thinking of new
ones but also the technology is evolving
if we look at what an interactive robot
or social robot is today versus what it
was five years ago or 10 years ago or 20
years ago the technology is very
different its capabilities are different
as we continue to develop new things
whether that be the technology or the
use cases for it then we need to keep
exploring these in our
actions and again going back to how do
we make this technology in a way that
benefits us as people and the users of
it so looking at some of the studies
that have been done right from a
psychological standpoint how would you
conduct one of those types of studies
like what would you find that would be
useful information so for instance I
know you got close to my face a few
seconds ago great way to do it right and
you know for some people it does for me
personally I have a very small but in
those situations though right there
there's generally a distance that people
typically like to hold right and a lot
of its cultural some of its social right
if it's just personal but how would you
go about setting up one of these studies
what kind of studies like these are
typically conducted when you're trying
to do some sort of research for human
robot interaction where you're trying to
say well a robot four feet away is okay
we're about two feet away
not so much or robot it's few feet away
that's six feet tall I really don't like
but if it's only a half a foot tall it
doesn't really bother me a whole lot
sure so I mean some of those questions
are very specific right you could
imagine how to design a study and you
know any particular study needs a design
that's appropriate for it but as a rule
of thumb again I go back to psychology
so when I was starting off doing my
master's degree at the MIT Media Lab 16
years ago one of my mentors was the late
cliff Nass at Stanford and cliff semi
jokingly would talk about his research
methodology as this he say so cliff was
an expert in human-computer interaction
right later went on to do some work in
robotics but he would say you know go
into the psychology section of the
library right I find a paper with a
great study about two people interacting
with one another and I would take one of
those people cross it out put computer
and steal it and so you know he ended up
publishing and a problem possibly
hundreds of studies right a lot of
different studies of human-computer
interaction now he was very clever than
about how he translated those into the
world of people interacting with
technology but in general that's a great
technique so some of those early studies
that I was doing you know more than a
decade a half ago cliff and I designed
together right really using that kind of
methodology okay if there's this kind of
a problem that you want to solve or this
kind of a thing you want to learn again
there's a great precedent and how do we
as people interact with one
another let's go borrow from that right
let's learn what we've already used in
you know academic or research settings
to understand how people are interacting
with one another and understand how we
apply that with technology and so it's a
great way to think about that right
again what we're building in terms of
the technology is very new what we're
creating in terms of the interactions is
not right we really want to leverage
what we as people already innately or
naturally know what to do and how to do
with other people but understand where
the technology fits into that so when we
talk about kind of this human robot
interaction and in this technology and
building this technology obviously the
idea of prototyping in building the
actual physical robot and there's a lot
of work and a lot of studies that have
been done on how to build a robot right
so what are some of the things that you
do Mike Italia health and you were
designing maybe so you know in the in
the early days of building you know the
application that we're doing in terms of
what's going to interact with patients
we didn't need the actual physical robot
right that could be built in parallel so
we started testing things out with
patients nope again didn't know the
robot yeah it's the very first robot we
had well I seen those little blue
recycling bins we took one of those we
turned it upside down put two googly
eyes on it and taped the tablet to it
with some mock-up software running on it
right and went and put that in front of
patients that was our first version
right next version we got much more
advanced we took that and we put a
Bluetooth speaker inside of it and one
of our writers was in the next room
acting as the robot interactions
actually told us a lot right because we
could constrain things in such a way
that we were trying to solve particular
challenges trying to think about how we
would introduce those with people and
what kind of conversation should we have
right we could constrain what
conversations we were having on our end
and see what people did and we got it
was pretty amazing you know you put this
blue trashcan down in front of someone
you know the first thing they're gonna
look at you like you're a little bit
crazy but then you start having a
conversation to get right into it we've
got videos of some of our early patient
testers who were using this and you know
they start opening up after about 60 90
second
right totally forget that it's a blue
trashcan sitting in front of them but
getting right into what we were trying
to get so you can achieve a lot with
building very little hardware and
software if you want to think about the
user experience and the user interaction
side of building robots and so again we
were doing these in parallel right part
of its building the hardware because
ultimately we want a product that we can
put in front of a patient have them
interact with but we can start doing a
lot of the design of that before you
know well before we have the actual
robot so why do you think it was that if
you could put just a blue trashcan with
some googly eyes in front of people that
they would open up and kind of feel this
connection what do you what do you think
it is about that so it kind of triggers
that yeah so it's a great question it
comes down to you know really what we
focus on here in catania health which is
not so much the technology right the
technologies and support of the real
problems that we're trying to solve
which is how do we engage a patient keep
them engaged for longer in their own
healthcare and for us that comes down to
really three things
so what we're building is the
intersection of you know medicine
medical best practices so in a
particular group of patients dealing
with a certain condition or disease and
a certain treatment what are the best
practices like what do we need to be
talking to those patients about one of
the things that we follow up on with
them to a psychology all right really a
few types of psychology so in particular
psychology of relationships sorry how do
we as people create build up and
maintain a relationship over time as
well as some aspects of the psychology
of behavior change and a few other
things that we draw from here and then
ultimately for us those are tied
together with our artificial
intelligence algorithms so that's how
we're really generating a conversation
in real time for that patient now those
first two though don't require the AI
algorithms and those are the things that
we can start testing right away right we
know what kind of conversations were
gonna build we may not be ready to
deliver them purely through software
when we start doing our testing but we
can create those conversations we can
have those conversations with a patient
and ultimately those conversations that
we have using humans with our patients
same as a doctor or a nurse is going to
have that's what we want to be building
into our technology right so the
technology is what ultimately gets us to
the point where we can have those
conversations in a very scalable way
tens or hundreds of thousands or
millions of patients having those
conversations with you know a speaker
inside of an uptight upside down
recycling bin right is a great way to
start to get us there and really
understanding the nature of that
interaction because again for us it
really comes back to the psychology
right how do you how do you actually
engage that person it shouldn't matter
whether it's a robot doing it or a
person doing it obviously there are some
differences right and that's stuff that
we've studied along the way and many
other people now have as well but the
nature of those conversations you can
deliver through many different means
yeah I think you've hit on something
that's really kind of important when you
talk about robotics because a lot of
people think when you're working with
robots
it's just tech right it's the algorithms
it's the hardware right right and that's
not the point typically of a robot right
the point typically if a robot is to
solve a problem exactly in an efficient
way right right or in a way that's not
achievable otherwise so doing what
you've done and kind of focusing you're
just saying this is the tech and the
tech kind of just fits in right it might
not be the most it doesn't need to be
cutting-edge it needs to be reliable and
it needs to work well in the situations
that we need to test it in and then we
can move forward to actually solving the
bigger problem exactly which i think is
great
looking at these interactions with this
Bluetooth speaker under the bin I'm
actually really kind of it's kind of
blowing my mind that that's the actual
approach that you went with really your
first prototype what kind of prototype I
guess did you bring to investors first
of all and what was the reaction once
you brought it to an event to investors
typically so you know we've talked to a
lot of different investors in the life
of this company or you know even
starting before the company officially
existed right so started talking to
investors about three years ago now and
you know that's very early days you know
we didn't have a trash can yet you know
it was really concept raised money you
know initial angel money based on that
right really on the concept now you know
I should say in the background you know
before this I built the first version of
this and deployed it with patients ten
years ago so it's not like this was a
brand new concept there's a lot of you
know academic and medical research
behind how and why this is going to work
but in terms of catelleya health and
this company
raise the initial money before any
prototype for hardware or software
existed now the the bulk of our first
seed round came after we had a prototype
that started to look like what the real
product does now right so the more you
know as with any company right the the
more you get in terms of fidelity and
closeness to a real product real
customers obviously you know that makes
it much easier story with investors and
so for us in the early days it was
really about here's the problem that
we're focused on solving here's the
technology that we're going to be
building here's why we as a team are
good to build that right in part because
I have done this before
I built this kind of technology
successfully delivered it to patients
and here's where we think we're going
and why we can get there a certain
timeline so that was a lot of that
message in in the early days of
fundraising for catelleya health how
many iterations did it take you to
finally feel comfortable with your final
product so in terms of the the design of
the physical thing or the software the
interactions or which apartment from the
side of them the physical the physical
robot right so he could yeah you're
trying to really focus on how a patient
is going to engage with this and it's
very important that a patient doesn't
feel weird right right so how do you
kind of go about okay well this is where
we started this was okay you know
obviously you get the blue trash bin
googly eyes right then then a Bluetooth
speaker right and then it slowly it
seems like it's slowly kind of built up
over time but there's a point where you
say okay I have all the function
components that I need but now I'm going
to change the design because the eye
doesn't look quite right or the head is
in quite the right shape like we're kind
of how did you go about making those
types of decisions sure what kind of
testing did you do like to a focus group
and then do you feel that right now
you're at a stable point with your
problem so it was deciding our maybe
robot for catania health we actually
have a very fast process of designing
that actual robot right so the really
early stuff in terms of you know the
trashcan or if you can see the the
cardboard things behind us here right
those were really for testing more the
user experience not the actual design of
the robot right we simply deliberately
separated these things out the actual
design of the rope
from beginning to end took us about four
to five weeks all right now we went with
you know I do a great design firm worked
with their San Francisco studio a few
blocks from where we are now so idea was
actually with the early investors in our
company we were startup in residence so
we spent five months working right in
the middle of their studio the
industrial design process for this robot
was like I said about five weeks so we
went in with you know here is the design
brief the first week or so was you know
coming up with all sorts of crazy ideas
right so taking that in many different
directions things that look you know all
different you know designs and styles
and you know some things it might be an
appliance some things that are like
totally sci-fi some things that there's
you know no way we could ever
manufacture but the starting off with
just this this ideation phase and from
that we started to narrow down alright
so let's get rid of the things they're
just like totally weird and out there we
don't think people would ever want let's
get rid of things that you know maybe we
could manufacture but it would cost us a
whole lot of money and as a start-up
that's just not a good thing
hey and that left us you know with a
smaller set of things and we started
putting those in front of people all
right so I wouldn't say it's you know
particularly focus groups but going out
to places where we could interact with
our potential patient population so we
helped a lot of patients who tend to be
older not necessarily tend to be dealing
with chronic diseases and so you know
putting some of these designs in front
of people now first up was stuff on
paper right drawings on the computer
screen on paper getting some quick
feedback and we tried to really rapidly
iterate and narrow in on what might work
and so it's a combination of you know
feedback that we got from people but
also my experience of building stuff
like this for the last 15 years right by
the time we were doing that design and
so just an understanding then of what
people are going to react to so our
design brief going into that was really
simple one this needs to have eyes right
because we know the power of this
psychologically right something that
actually looks at you and makes eye
contact while it's interacting is very
important too we want to screen on it
speech technology is getting much better
right so this was you know a couple of
years ago the Amazon echo was out today
we have you know more devices like this
from you know Google and Apple and many
other things that we can talk to it's
definitely getting better there's a lot
more that you can do but in healthcare
we need to to make sure that we're
always very accurate so one of the
things that we do on the robot is when
she's speaking
showing what she's saying on the screen
I can respond by talking to her we're
pressing a button and sometimes you
might want to say oh hey do you remember
when your doctor showed you how to
whatever right can I show you that video
again I said to be able to do things
like that so that was criteria number
two and then point number three was we
wanted this roughly the size of a
kitchen appliance all right now we could
build something that's humanoid right as
big as you or me it's gonna take up a
lot of space in our home right that's
not great for a lot of people we could
make this the size of a cell phone right
possible given the technology it's gonna
get you know put behind the bookshelf or
you know tossed in the kitchen drawer
people are gonna forget about it too
easily so so it's kind of roughly the
size and so you know with that set of
criteria we were able to then hone in on
some of these early designs and say okay
here's the set of things that fit now
okay we actually like this from this one
this from this one let's put those
together and so just a very rapid
iteration process you know having a team
of professional industrial designers who
were focused on this project and able to
really quickly iterate let us go from
you know initial concept to basically
what we have today in a period of about
a month was there any other design or
talk about having the robot look more
lifelike so you know looking like like
in a robot can be good or bad I did and
that's a matter of perspective and
opinion I think there there are some
parts of the world where people are
really focused on designing robots that
might look very humanoid there's you
know this concept called the uncanny
valley that I'm sure you're familiar
with and you know we really don't want
to fall into the bottom of the uncanny
valley right this thing and just ends up
looking very creepy given what we're
doing also again going back to you know
where we position ourselves as a company
in healthcare we want to make sure we
setup the right expectations
all right so uncanny valley is often
talked about as the look of this thing
right you don't want to look too
humanoid but there are also a lot of
other expectations that come out of that
not just the appearance but the overall
interaction right so for the same reason
that we don't try to make this look like
a person we don't make it sound like a
person right now we want a very
intelligible voice so we have a
computer-generated voice that's you know
easy to understand but is not human
recorded speech and also for similar
reasons we don't have to
we open-ended conversations with us the
robots always directing the conversation
because we don't want to set up
expectations with our patients that this
can just talk about anything right you
can just sit down and talk to it because
then the expectations are too high so
you know with that set of things that
helps us to start making these decisions
about you know what this looks like how
humanoid should it be if you look at our
maybe robot it's you know you're never
gonna confuse this for a person right
it's clearly yellow plastic right or or
in the near future other colors as well
right it has human-like features right
it has eyes that are gonna look at you I
let's see there's a head on there but
the rest of its you know this squat body
in the screen right so it's not like
this looks just like a human but enough
of those features to really draw on the
psychology of interaction right
something looks at me I immediately look
back right so using those types of
things in the design are very important
but trying to make it look like a person
you know one is gonna lead to the wrong
expectations and two is very expensive
right building a product like that
starts to get really difficult to
actually manufacture a scale for the
same reason that you have the the eyes
that kind of look at you is there a
conscious decision to not make a mouth
that move as well because you do fall
into that uncanny valley even though it
would be more of a like a computer
synthesized a computer-generated voice
but the you're worried about the lips or
the the mouth kind of sinking up to the
words and making sure yeah so it's a
combination of things right doing that
is really hard and you so that's one
thing and you know to I challenge you to
go find a robot out there that has
moving lips it actually looks good
right it always ends up being a little
bit creepy no maybe there are some out
there I haven't seen yet there's a lot
of people working on stuff like this
right now so be great if there is but I
think for what we're doing
it doesn't necessarily add a lot of
value to it and people perceive this
thing as talking to them even though the
mouth is you know a smile line embedded
in the plastic it's not like there's
anything there that moves or even opens
people have no problem talking this is
having a conversation and and what I've
seen is again
many robots out there do have moving
lips none of them kind of crossed that
threshold of not being creepy you're
just wrong right and it's many of them
are now good enough that it's not like
you know that's weird but there's this
disconnect sure
all right so uncanny comes from Freud
zoo in Heimlich all right so so this
feeling that something's just not quite
right and through a lot of the studies
that I did more than a decade ago we
found that many of the features that are
not quite right like that people aren't
necessarily going to say oh that's wrong
and be able to point that out and say
this is this is a problem but if you
actually look at their experience with
this robot and you compare one versus
another then in that underlying data
about the psychology of the interaction
you can see these very clear differences
so part of its just learning these
lessons about what things work what
things don't and then how do we apply
those in the design of future robots can
you talk a little bit about the reaction
that you receive from patients when they
you know unbox their first maybe one
kind of work with it in their house well
I think the reaction starts like the
reactions that we care about start even
before that okay so one of the things
that we think about is how is this
introduced to a patient it's not like
some of this box shows up at the
doorstep right yeah oh my god there's a
robot in here right so the patient's
going to be introduced to those in some
way right now that's either through
their pharmacy if they're getting a
certain prescription that this might
come with or in the near future patients
who are going to be discharged from the
hospital might be getting one of these
as well so a nurse is going to be
telling them about it what's that
language that we use right then all
right so how do we set up the
expectations in the right way and and
set up the the relationship that we want
this patient to have how they're gonna
benefit from it in a way that they
believe that right they believe this is
a tool that is going to be useful for
them and something that they're going to
benefit from so the the initial thing
that we think about is what's what's the
language in that first conversation
who's going to be delivering it to them
right and what should they be saying how
do we talk about the benefits to a
patient before they ever even see this
thing so you know our patients get this
box at home and it's probably the first
time they've received a robot in the
mail
and so maybe at first is a little bit of
confusion so we try to make things as
clear as possible right when they first
open up the box is a little one-page
instruction sheet right and it gives the
whole long list of instructions which is
take it out of box and plug it in that's
it
so really simple and having a focus on
making this really easy for someone to
use is important given who we're
shipping these to right some of our
patients are gonna be very tech savvy
and they got a couple of computers and
you know their Smart Watch and a
cellphone or two some of them we know of
never owned a computer right so so
making it so that anyone across this
whole spectrum can use this is important
and they plug it in and you know of
course it's essentially a computer or
phone kind of thing in here so it's
gonna take a minute to boot up but as
soon as it does it looks at them right
oh hey good to see you thanks for taking
me on that box getting cramped in there
and so we try to make a little bit
humorous at first
and of course we're reading the emotion
on that person's face right do they like
this you know do they appreciate it all
right dumbest thing I've ever heard
right so we want to know that so we
start adapting to them right away and so
it's important for us to you know create
some delight in that person right away
right so that they like interacting with
this you know we want to bring a smile
to their face and from there we go into
more of the here's why I'm here
right I'm here to help you do you know
with this condition that you're dealing
with or you know with this drug that
you're taking and so making sure that
you know in those first few seconds and
in the first few minutes that we're
really communicating to our patients you
know why this is something of value to
them and by focusing on these things
right so making sure this is something
that's you know a delightful experience
to start and showing you know me as a
patient why this has value to me we get
a very positive response from almost
everyone that we've put these in front
of so one of our challenges over running
various trials over the last decade from
the first hand built version of this
that I put in front of patients back in
2007 to the early versions of maybe that
we've been putting in front of patients
now the challenge has been we give these
to patients for maybe it's half an hour
maybe it's a few days maybe it's a few
months at the end of it they won't give
them back to us so I think it's a great
challenge to have but it shows you what
kind of reception these
do have with patients who are using
right and I think that's a lot because
you're focusing on the underlying
problem yeah you're you really focused
on the person at the end of the day and
not the technology itself I know we kind
of talked about this a little bit
earlier but it's really about how do we
help people and not how do we build a
cool robot
right look at all the bells and whistles
this has versus look what I can actually
do for somebody exact based on what I've
helped put together right so so we think
about robotics as an enabling technology
not as an industry right we don't think
of this as a robotics company right the
name of the company is not you know
catelleya robotics we're Kataya health
right we're a health care company you
know roughly half maybe a little under
half of our employees of a technical
background right we've also got nurses
and psychologists and doctors and
writers and you know overall we're
solving a healthcare problem the
technology just happens to help us do
that
how do you ensure that your robot is
performing more or less ethically for
the space that you're in so I know
there's issues when you're dealing with
healthcare when you're tracking people's
health so I think there are two things
that we think about here so so one is
you know we're building a new
application for a group of patients and
we think of as an application for us is
really the intersection of you know some
disease day some condition and some
treatment right so we're helping
patients with a certain type of cancer
take this oral drug every day for
example right what do we want to be
doing to benefit those patients okay and
so part of that for us is let's look
into the challenges right for patients
today what are the challenges that they
have successfully staying on therapy how
do we go about solving those and again
the technology that is a piece that lets
us do this not for one patient but for
thousands tens of thousands hundreds of
thousands of patients and so that's
really kind of a guiding principle here
what are we doing to help this patient
population better manage their own
therapy and get information back to
their care team so that those people can
help manage that group of patients so
that's that's one set of things and
that's really the thing that drives how
we design everything that we do the
other then is on the regulatory side
right if we look at where we fit in
terms of the healthcare industry there
are certain things that we can and can't
do in terms of what type of a device
this is and the good thing about that is
that's a you know a very well-developed
field right you got this you know big
entity called FDA right and there's a
lot of guidance from FDA that is not
necessarily about robotics okay I can
actually guarantee you that none of it
is about robotics but it's still very
applicable right in terms of what we're
actually doing with our patients the
challenges of the problems that we're
trying to solve for them all of this
guidance and you know the laws and the
rules are very applicable to what we're
doing so we can use that also as a
reference for the types of things we can
and should and cannot should not do with
patients so if you were designing the
robot for to work with a human outside
of us they may move for instance in just
in general if you were somebody out
there who was interested in building the
robot to kind of work alongside human
what would you suggest that that person
do well I think that you know just like
we've been talking about in terms of the
specifics of you know maybe what we're
doing it can tell you how if the first
thing is understanding what's the
problem you're trying to solve right so
the example I gave is okay we look at
this patient population and understand
what are the challenges today same thing
that applies anywhere right any problem
you're trying to solve understand what
are the real challenges today right so
in other words what that means is not
start with the robot okay and okay here
are the features that we want to build
into this piece of technology this
device but let's look at the problem
space that we're working in let's
understand you know what we're doing or
not doing what are the challenges that
people actually have and try to set up
that question in such a way that you
know we get real answers right in other
words we're not trying to project what
we think we can or can't do onto that
but actually try to get some answers
from people about what's happening and
and one of the real problems that need
to be solved this is so I have a
question for you Cory so typically when
I'm getting ready to build anything I
end up doing research and my research
always leads me down this rabbit hole
we're all of a sudden I'm like well I
just need to build something really
quick to do X right let's say for
instance I want to build a robot like
robot head okay well I just want to
build a robot head really quick so I bet
you I could do this with like cardboard
and maybe some toilet paper tubes and
I'm probably okay but then I started
doing some research and I start looking
around and I say well
actually you know catelleya health has a
great robot it's nice it's made of
plastic and it's got nice eyes that move
and everything maybe I should do
something in plastic so now I start
looking at 3d printers and then I say
well you know plastic is cheap maybe I
can move over toward something that's a
little bit more you know durable
long-term like a piece of like some
metals now I'm looking at learning how
to use a CNC machine and it just it just
kind of spirals forever and I just never
get going
what is your suggestion on how to just
get started so you know learning all
those tools and you know how to work
with all those materials great skill set
to have right but what you got to focus
on is the problem that you're trying to
solve right so it's kind of a theme of
this conversation that we've had here
what is the real problem I want to solve
right is it figuring out how big this
thing should be and cut a bunch of stuff
out of paper right ones small medium
large is it deciding what degrees of
freedom this has the toilet paper tubes
and you know the other cardboard stuff
great way to start mocking that up right
next iteration you know you add some
servos to the cardboard I've built
robots that way literally hobby servos
and cardboard put together and even some
of the early studies that I've talked
about in terms of psychology of the
interaction this is how those robots
were built right because solving those
problems don't require a you know
commercially polished robot that I'm
gonna sell to a million people I think
one of the challenges is focusing in on
what's the real problem right now we've
talked about this today in terms of the
context of you know business and
prototyping and a number of other
aspects and I think this is something
that's really easy to get distracted
from right when you start talking about
technology it's always easy let's do
this one extra thing or wouldn't this be
great to pull in here wait look at that
right like you're saying and put that in
there the challenge for anyone building
this stuff is how do you make sure you
maintain that focus so let's say now I
have a robot that I've built
I finally gotten over this hurdle of you
know using cardboard and toilet paper
rolls or something like that and I want
to actually test my prototype in front
of somebody right but I'm a little
reluctant I don't I don't feel confident
with my design what's the best way for
me to kind of you know overcome that and
how would I go about setting up that
kind of an environment
so you know I think there's a few things
to think about one is do it you know as
early and as often as possible
right so having whatever you're building
in front of people is really valuable
and I think one thing you find when
you're doing that is it's actually a lot
easier than you think
in terms of getting people to interact
with stuff now it depends a lot of what
you're trying to build right if you
build stuff like we are in healthcare
that I'm looking for a certain patient
population to do it if I'm building you
know something for entertainment or a
toy or that a lot of people would use
you know go to your family your friends
write whomever you can you know kind of
get for five minutes to interact with
this as early as possible right from
from the mock-up stage to every
iteration of your prototype with this in
front of people and understand what it
is you're trying to get feedback on hey
like if you want feedback on this as a
business and how you're gonna sell a lot
of these that's one type of question if
it's okay I have this thing that moves
in a certain way how do people respond
to that that's a very different type of
question so one thing I see a lot is
I've taught courses in human robot
interaction in a few different schools
is you know students who are starting
off on this early on are gonna test this
thing Hey but without figuring out what
the questions are if you think about
kind of basics of science same thing
applies here right what's the question
you're trying to ask what's the
hypothesis right what what you know set
this up like a study right like an
experiment I want to learn this about
this thing that I built okay that means
I need to ask this question or this
question or I want to put this in front
of a person and have it do this thing or
you so be very clear on what you're
trying to do and again don't worry about
the fidelity of your prototype what's
the worst thing that can happen by
putting it out too early maybe you don't
learn enough and you figure out okay
here's the thing I need to refine or you
can go and you can spend months building
this prototype that you think is really
elegant and you finally put it in front
of people and you realize that one of
your base assumptions was wrong and then
you go back and start all over right and
so and that's why I always stress like
getting this out as early as possible
when I've had students building things
you know in a semester-long class often
the the most advanced technology that
will let them you
is a Lego Mindstorm right everything has
to be simpler than that right you should
do the quickest prototype because the
feedback is more important in terms of
what's the problem you're trying to
solve and how are people going to
respond to this general concept before
you even worry about refining the actual
hardware or software that goes into your
robot all that stuff's really time
consuming but it's a whole lot easier
when you know exactly what you want to
build with how people are going to
respond to it so what are some of the
major misconceptions that you find when
dealing with human robot interaction
where a person tends to believe
something is going to occur with a robot
but really doesn't so I think the
biggest thing is like at a cultural
level like there's this concept that
robots are scary right people are not
gonna use this hey the reality is and we
put these in front of people I love it
all right this thing is not scary you
know we're not building some big sci-fi
robot you know with lasers in its eyes
this is a cute little thing about this
big this is how hey how's it going right
and just has a simple conversation and
so while again there might be this big
conception that robots are scary things
or technology that talks to you by your
healthcare not good be on the ground
reality when we put this in front of
patients they love it I think that's the
biggest lesson and part of that just
comes from iteratively building and
testing this with a lot of people over
many years so obviously being CEO of
your own company it has its own
advantages yes what's your favorite
thing that you like to do for your can
for your job you know it varies a lot in
terms of you know what I'm doing in a
particular day right as CEO of a small
company I do a lot of different jobs and
roles but for me a lot of the the really
fun stuff comes back to the product that
we're building right so we can build new
features not for the sake of technology
but for the sake of you know benefiting
a patient and actually get those in
front of people and see how they respond
to it all right so when I see someone
who you know talks about this thing that
we've built in the way of it you know
we've had patients say I can't live
without this right like that's exciting
like they see value in this for them and
for their health and you know I love
seeing that for our students who are
interested in investigating HRI what are
some of the cutting edge areas that you
see kind of developing right now so you
know I think the interesting thing
that's happening with robotics right now
is a lot of the core technologies have
matured
the point where we can build real stuff
and so what that means now is we don't
have to think about this as a robotics
industry but is using robotics to solve
a lot of other problems and so I think
many students who are interested in
robotics have other areas of interest as
well all right so if you think about
could Talia help at a really high level
we're combining this technology robotics
and AI with the healthcare domain and a
specific set of problems within there
and I think we're starting to see a lot
of those intersections and the very
interesting companies that we're seeing
come out that leverage robotics is the
technology are the ones not trying to
build a robot platform but the ones who
are trying to solve particular problems
and so in some senses it's a very vague
answer right I'm not saying you know
this area or that area but in some sense
it's very concrete in that the
interesting stuff that we're gonna see
over the next few years and the
successful robotics companies are the
ones who are solving very
domain-specific problems leveraging
robotics technology and we're starting
to see that pop up in a lot of different
areas right my interest for a long time
has been in healthcare so I'm most
familiar with what's going on there but
we're seeing this across healthcare
there's a ton of these companies in
education there's a lot like
entertainment and play and you know with
kids and so many different applications
of robotics but it's where those
companies and those people are really
focused on solving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
