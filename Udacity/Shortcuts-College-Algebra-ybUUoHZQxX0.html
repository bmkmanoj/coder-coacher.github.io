terms in the context of simplifying
expressions for a while and our whole
goal with doing all this is to make our
expressions look prettier to make them
easier to read but still let us know
what kind of math were talking about so
something we're doing a lot of is taking
shortcuts in fact most of the time that
you do this you probably don't even
realize that that's what's happening
let's say for example that we have
something like two plus two plus two
plus two so we have 5 2's added together
now normally if we wanted to express
this quantity we wouldn't write it this
way we wouldn't write all the twos added
together instead we would say okay how
many twos do you want to add 5 well
that's just the same as 5 times 2 since
you've added to 2 itself five times so
as it turns out multiplication is
actually just a major shortcut to
repeated addition in the same way we can
use exponents to indicate repeated
multiplication of the same number so
let's say that instead of having two
plus two plus two plus two plus two we
have 52 is multiplied together in this
case we can use another kind of shortcut
we can rewrite this using an exponent
just like we talked about in the last
quiz you may have already had a lot of
practice with exponents in previous
courses but just in case you've
forgotten exactly how they work we're
going to talk about that right now so
let's write this these 52 s multiplied
together using exponential notation so
we're going to start by identifying the
number that we want to multiply it by
itself so in that case this is too so
let's write that down and then we count
how many of these twos are multiplied
together so we know that we have five
and we take that number five the number
of two's were multiplying and we write
that as a superscript of two so
superscript is just a small number
written to the upper right hand corner
of this other number and we call to the
number that we're multiplying over and
over again the base number and we call
this little five its exponent now since
you're going to be entering most of your
answers on a computer for this class or
probably all of your answer is actually
considering this is an online course
you're going to have to type in answers
with exponents in a special way so what
you do is you type in the base number
normally so you would type in a two but
then in order to type the number that's
in the exponent or in order to end
gate that this five is in this exponent
slot we need to write a carrot before
the five so these are the three keys
that you'll type in order to enter this
exact answer on a computer it's like
this little arrow here is pointing up to
indicate that this number that follows
it is going to be in that higher
elevated exponent position as you can
see down here now if you have more than
just a number in the exponent then you
put parentheses around the entire
expression that you want to have
positioned in that exponent spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
