typically do you might visit an app
store like this and download it or you
could actually walk into a store and buy
a physical copy you have a lot of
different options you might even say you
have a list of options now how often
have you seen software for linux sitting
up on a store shelf not very often if at
all but we still have a list of various
places we can go to get software this is
called a package source list let's take
a look all of your available package
sources are listed in this file ET c /
app / sources list remember when we were
discussing distributions we said each
one approves and releases packages in
their own way and that's one of the big
ways in which they differ this is the
packages list for your current version
of ubuntu as you skim through the file
you will see some pretty recognizable
parts we see a URL here and the word
trusty looks familiar that's the code
name for the version villain to we're
running we know you've on tues also
based off Debian so that's probably this
de B stands for here this is a list of
software repositories that you want to
set up for us automatically there are a
lot in this list and each of these would
be referenced when you try to update or
install new software speaking of which
let's go ahead and make sure that all of
our software is up to date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
