gonna wrap this up by talking about
something we promise to talk about at
the end of last class which is mechanism
design cool right that seems reasonable
right
it's like mechanical engineering it is
not like mechanical engineering except
in a very abstract and analogy sense
okay so what mecha mechanism design is
it's kind of art the science and the
engineering daresay it of creating games
to elicit certain kind of behavior so so
far what we've been talking about
without our solution concepts and all
the things that we'd be doing in game
theory one two and three so far as we've
talked about what happens when we play
games and you know at least stepping
back a little bit what we get when we
play games is we get certain predictable
behaviors and those behaviors are
natural they're Nash equilibria or maybe
they're correlated equilibria or maybe
they're Koko whatever other things we
haven't talked about but here what we
want to do in mechanism design is we
want to make a game instead of just play
a game but again with the end goal of
getting some specific behave okay does
that make sense it feels kind of like
converse reinforcement learning and that
we're going from the behavior that we
want to a game that would make that
behavior whereas in regular game theory
we go from the game to the behavior okay
I like that in fact I like it so much I
will draw the arrow that way so here we
have a behavior we want and we're gonna
come up with the game that would
actually lead to that behavior I like
that and then once we've made a game
what will happen is we will get people
to play that game and then that will
generate the right behavior nice okay
cool so it's like a sort of cycle of
life thing yeah it's not a cycle though
but sure that's like yeah but no arrow
means anything it means its behaviors
are lead to behaviors right which lead
to a game sure okay so there are lots of
ways that we could talk about this but I
think for the purpose of this class I
think the most interesting way to kind
of get across mechanism design is just
to give a few examples so I'm gonna give
two or maybe three examples and sort of
work through what is sort of easy and
hard about mechanism design and try to
give you a feel for why this is actually
important and how by making little sort
of specific decisions you can have a
huge impact on the behavior that people
have and in fact you know you could
that everything that happens in politics
the laws that we make they're all about
mechanism design they're all about
figuring out how to influence behavior
they're all about incentivizing ticular
behavior by people so the big example
that people talk about every four years
when there's a presidential election
inquiry about you know the budget is one
of the biggest sort of mechanism design
things implemented in the last several
hundred years which is the mortgage
deduction hmm so if you buy a house and
you take on a mortgage you get a huge
deduction and why is that a good thing
well because it makes buying a house
cheaper so it actually encourages you to
buy a house and we think that's a good
idea for a bunch of reasons but it
doesn't even really matter why we think
it's a good idea we have actually
constructed something to encourage
people to buy houses okay so let's see
if we can kind of do this in the small
and kind of think about how you might go
about thinking about how you would
generate certain behavior in people okay
okay good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
