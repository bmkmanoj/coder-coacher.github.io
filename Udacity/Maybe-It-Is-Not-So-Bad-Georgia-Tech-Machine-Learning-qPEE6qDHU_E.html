maybe the situation's not so bad after
all so let's look at a particular
example we've got our input space
consisting of say the first 10 integers
and our hypothesis space is you take an
input and then you just return whether
or not it's greater than or equal to
some theta so that's a parameter and now
how big is the hypothesis space what
type is Theta let's say theta is a real
number oh then it's infinite infinite
indeed it is now on the other hand what
would you do to try to learn this can
you use the algorithm that we talked
about before to learn in this in this
particular space so I guess what I'm
asking is is there a way that you can
sort of sneakily apply the ideas from
before now the ideas from before were
that you actually keep track of all the
hypotheses and to keep the version space
and once you've seen enough examples
that are randomly drawn you would you'll
be able to know that you've epsilon
exhausted the version space and then
ultimately any hypothesis that's left is
going to be ok so what can we possibly
do to track all these hypotheses it's
problematic because there's an infinite
number of them ok I see where you're
going with this so when I ask you what
type of was you said it was a real
number but it would have been easier if
theta weren't a real number but we're in
fact you know a positive integer say or
non-negative integer that's true though
there's still an infinite number of
those true but it doesn't matter because
the size of X is itself finite so any
value of theta greater than 10 for
example it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter because it'll always give me the
same answer all right so if we what if
we only track the non-negative integers
10 or below this would be what it's
finite and it gives us the same answer
as if we had actually tracked the the
infinite hypothesis space so there's
kind of well yeah I know you had to get
a good way of saying it before you want
to say it again what was the difference
between kind of this hypothesis base
that we're working with and the
hypothesis space as we defined it so
there's a there's a notion of a
syntactic hypothesis space which is all
the things you could possibly write and
then there's the semantic hypothesis
space which are the actual different
functions that you are practically
representing yeah I like that that that
you can make a distinction between a
semantic
we say finite hypothesis space that
actually specified syntactically
infinitely and you also had the example
of a decision tree with discrete inputs
as also being kind of like this that we
you know we generally think about only
ones that split on a attribute once but
syntactically you could keep splitting
on it it just doesn't give you a
semantically different tree so this is
kind of at the heart of what we're going
to be able to do to talk about how we
can learn in an infinite hypothesis
space more complicated ones than this
example here but at the same time
without having to track an infinite
number of hypotheses because there's
just not that many that are meaningfully
different I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
