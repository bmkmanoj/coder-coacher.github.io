systems is concerned in their native
form when they think about physical
memory they think of physical memory as
contiguous but unfortunately the real
physical memory we are going to call it
machine memory from now on is in the
control of the hypervisor not in the
control of any one operating system so
the physical memory of each of these
operating systems is itself an illusion
it's no longer contiguous in terms of
the real machine memory that the
hypervisor controls so for instance if
you look at the physical memory that
Windows has I've broken that down into
two regions r1 and r2 and r1 has let's
say a number of pages 0 through Q and r2
has a number of pages starting from Q
plus 1 through n so this is a physical
memory but if you look at this region r1
it's occupying a space in the machine
memory the real physical memory which we
call the machine memory controlled by
the hypervisor over here r2 is not
contiguous with respect to r1 in the
machine memory it's been put over here
and come over to this guy Linux and it
has its own physical memory and we'll
call that region 1 and region 2 again
and it has a total capacity of M plus 1
physical page frames out of which 0
through L are contiguous in the machine
memory l plus 1 through m are contiguous
in machine memory but they're not
contiguous with respect to the other
region r1 why would this happen the
hypervisor is not being nasty to the
operating system after all even if all
of the n plus 1 pages of Windows and M
plus 1 pages of Linux were to be
contiguous in the machine memory they
cannot all start at 0 because the
physical memory the real physical memory
which we are calling
memory is the only thing that is
contiguous and that has to be
partitioned between these two guys and
therefore the starting point for the
physical memory the illusion of the
physical memory so far as a particular
operating system cannot be 0 also the
memory requirements of operating systems
are dynamic and bursty and windows
started out initially with Q plus 1
pages and later on it needed additional
memory then it was going to request the
hypervisor and at that point it may not
be possible for the hypervisor to give
another region which is contiguous with
the previous region that Windows already
has so these are the reasons why the
physical memory of an operating system
itself becomes an illusion in terms of
how it is actually contained in the
machine memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
