is what snowing in as an auditing mixed
net and the idea here is that each
participant in the mixed net can audit
some of the outputs of the next step so
to do that we need to provide extra
inputs so instead of the voter just
providing the vote as encrypted to party
a they'll provide it to party be as well
so all of the incoming votes go to the
next two steps and now be is going to
audit a and it does that by picking some
random set of inputs so let's say it
picks this one and it picks this one and
then pick some of the ones in here so
that means it's looking at some of aids
outputs and we'll call these Y values so
this would be why to this be why
something else and this would be y of n
minus 1 okay and this would be why then
so for each of the N inputs Bob picks
some number 2 audio and what B does is
ask a to prove that y 2 is a valid input
in order to prove this what does a need
to provide so what must a provide to be
in order to prove that y 2 is a valid
output from is mixing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
