understanding of q-learning let's
consider how we can turn the stock
trading problem into a problem that
q-learning can solve to do that we need
to define our actions we need to define
our state and we also need to define our
rewards let's start here first with
actions it's actually pretty easy we
just have three actions buy sell or do
nothing so let's consider how that might
play out with an actual stock and let's
suppose we've already trained our cue
learner what to do let's see what's
likely to happen so usually what's going
to happen most frequently is that we do
nothing there will occasionally be buys
and sells but usually nothing well at
least that's my expectation we'll have
to see when we create these learners
what actually happens so we are
evaluating the factors of this stock in
other words we compute say several
technical indicators that is our state
we consider that state and we do nothing
so let's suppose we do nothing for quite
a long period here but somehow or
another after a little while boom
something triggers and says we should
buy so we buy the stock here we're
holding it we do nothing nothing nothing
nothing nothing nothing and boom are
very intelligent queue owner says hey
now is the time to sell and we continue
like that through the rest of our time
series let's consider now what these
buys and sells how they affect our
portfolio value so we start out with
whatever we've got in the bank and
there's no trading for a while suddenly
there's a buy and then we see an
increase in our portfolio value until we
hit that sell then nothing
again another buy and a sell and nothing
so you see this sort of step to behavior
now of course because I was drawing this
and I wanted us to look good I was
choosing opportunistic times to buy and
sell
your real strategy is probably not going
to be so good but ideally this is the
kind of thing we'd like to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
