to the gotta get this 64 over yeah I'm
working on it I have to get the 16 up to
64 status so I can't know I might
actually lose this gonna lose no Sara
this looks bad this is looking pretty
bad wait before you lose on camera let's
do our introduction oh look okay well
I'm all right fine
hi I'm Andy and I'm Sara and I'm
addicted to 2048 no I'm actually a
Udacity instructor who is also addicted
to 2048
yeah and I'm Sarah I'm a software
engineer and a course developer here and
as I have mentioned a lot of people at
our officer really addicted to this game
and we decide it would be a good way to
start experimenting with short courses
making a really small course that
hopefully a lot of people will get a lot
of enjoyment at oh yeah so this course
isn't going to teach you how to play the
game it's not even gonna teach you how
to program the game instead we're gonna
talk about how to modify the existing
code to make it your own right and I
actually went through this experience on
my own about a week ago I'm a pretty
novice programmer I've learned what I
know three dasty classes actually on the
job and going through this code base and
looking at how the HTML and the CSS and
the JavaScript interacted that was a
really valuable experience um
so I'm actually really excited to share
this with you guys and make our own
versions of 2048 yeah so the thing that
makes this project especially useful as
a teaching aid here is that it's an
open-source project meaning that anybody
can look at all the code they can take
it modify it they could push their
changes back to the original but most
people are just sort of making their own
like fun thing in fact there are a
couple of them that have made it pretty
big should we take a look yeah let's
look at a couple of those thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
