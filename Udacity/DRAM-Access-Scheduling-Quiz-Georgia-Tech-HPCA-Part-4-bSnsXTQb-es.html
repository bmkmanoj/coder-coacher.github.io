scheduling to take advantage of the fast
page access that we can have let's
assume we have a data memory that has 32
1 bit arrays just like the one we have
seen before each array is one megabit
and it's organized as 2 to the 10th rows
times 2 to the 10th bits per row each
array is a 16 megabit array organized as
2 to the 12th Rose which is 4096 rows
times 2 to the 12 bits per row and the
24-bit address that we feed to this
memory where bits are numbered 0 through
23 is thus divided by the DRAM into a 12
bit raw address which is the upper bits
of the address and the Colin address
which is the lower 12 bits of the
address of course the processor when it
issued this 24 bit physical address
wants to access 8 32-bit memory location
each chip is fed this address and the 32
chips together represent a 32-bit memory
so one chip for example might hold bit
number 7 from all the words in the 16
mega word memory let's say we have cache
misses currently pending for the
following addresses let's assume that it
takes 10 nanoseconds to open a page that
it takes 2 nanoseconds to read something
from the row buffer once the page is
open and 5 nanoseconds to close a page
these operations how long do they take
if we do them in this particular order
and how long do they take if we are
allowed to reorder them so that the time
gets reduced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
