recall that Sigma star is the union of
the strings of size zero with those of
size one but those of size two etc and
our overall strategy will be just to
assign the first numbers to Sigma 0 and
the next to sync but 1 the next 2 Sigma
2 etc more formally we can define n sub
K to be the total number of strings of
size at most k and then use this to
create the correspondence thus NK will
be the last number assigned to a string
of length K so in this way one will get
assigned to the empty string the only
element of Sigma 0 and then the next
numbers and 0 plus 1 through n sub 1
that'll get assigned to all the strings
of length 1 and in general n sub K minus
1 plus 1 through n sub K those set of
numbers will get assigned to Sigma K
those strings of length K within each
one of these arrows you can do the
correspondence in any way lexa graphical
order is as good as any for example we
can enumerate all the strings over the
binary alphabet like this first we
assign one to the empty string then we
enumerate all strings of length 1 then
those of length 2 and so forth this is
the main theorem that we will need here
concerning count ability but while we're
on the subject we'll say a few words
about count ability in general as a kind
of bonus the same argument here shows
that a countable union of finite sets is
countable suppose that our collection of
sets is s0 s1 etc and without loss of
generality we'll suppose that they are
disjoint if they happen not to be
disjoint we can always make them so by
just subtracting out from SK all the
elements it shares with the sets as 0
through SK minus 1 then the argument
proceeds justice before we assign the
first numbers to s 0 the next 2s 1 etc
now it turns out that we can actually
prove something even stronger than the
original statement here we can replace
the word finite with the word countable
and say that a count
union of countable sets is countable
notice that our current proof doesn't
work if we tried to count all the
elements of s0 before any elements of s1
we might never get to the elements of s1
because s 0 could be infinite
nevertheless this theorem is true for
convenience of notation will let the
elements of s k b xk 0 xk 1 etc and then
we can make each sk a row in a grid as
shown here again we can't go row by row
here because we might never finish the
first row if s 0 is infinite on the
other hand we can go diagonal by
diagonal since each diagonal is finite
the union of all the sk is the union of
all the rows but it's also the same
thing as the union of all the diagonals
each diagonal being finite we can apply
the original version of this theorem to
prove that a countable union of
countable sets is countable you can also
just translate the indices here on X
into an enumeration as well note that
the same idea proves that the rationals
are countable imagine putting all the
fractions with a 1 in the denominator in
the first row all those with a 2 in the
denominator in the second row all those
with 3 in the denominator in the third
row and so on and so forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
