is a way to use attributes defined in
the base class in the derived class
without needing a cut-and-paste any code
let's try a simple example to see how
this works before getting back to our
dishes I hope no one's too hungry don't
worry fied python is a dish best served
cold let's start by supposing we have a
bear class which has a grizzly bear as a
subtype here's the bear don't be put off
by its color and peace symbol looks like
a peaceful bear is actually very violent
and it's got an eat method it can eat a
human let's look at how that looks like
in code here's what that looks like in
code we've defined a bear class we have
defined a grizzly bear class with bears
its base class we don't actually have
any code in grizzly bear in the barre
class we've defined attributes we've got
an initializer that sets the name of the
bear and we've got an eat method that
eats a victim a victim has a name we'll
assume the victims of human so let's see
how that works i'm going to import from
the barre class the bear grizzly bear
and human definitions i haven't shown
you human but you should be able to
guess what it is we need to give the
bear someone to eat and we'll create
some instances of those objects a human
instance and will create a bear instance
since bear has a neat method the bear
should be able to eat a victim and
indeed it can we can also create a
grizzly bear we didn't define any
attributes for grizzly bear but it has
some the grizzly bear can also eat Dave
s'okay Dave can be eaten more than once
and we can look a little more closely at
what these attributes are so it says the
bound method of the grizzly bear object
and the grizzly bear object is this one
the bear object also has an eat method
and it's of the bear object note that
this is an attribute so we can assign it
let's get rid of the eat method for bear
because our bear is a nice peaceful bear
did that change the eat method for the
grizzly and it didn't the eat method for
grizzly is still there that method got
bound when the grizzly bear instance was
created and the grizzly bear can still
eat Dave as many times as he wants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
