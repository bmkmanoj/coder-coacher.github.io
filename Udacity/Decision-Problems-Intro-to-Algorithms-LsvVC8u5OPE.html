to be talking about simpler we're going
to focus in on in some sense very simple
kinds of problems problems that take
input just like we've been looking at
you know a be it a graph or a list
whatever it happens to be and processes
that to get an answer and the answer is
just zero or one yes or no so that's the
sense of which it's making a decision
it's it's making a yes/no decision based
on on the inputs an example is graphed
connectivity where you're given a graph
and you're asked are all the nodes
reachable from all the other nodes in
the graph and you know the answer is
either yes or no it's either connected
or it's not connected so even though
this output is very very simple just
zero or one one bit it can actually be
fairly complicated sometimes very very
complicated to take the input and decide
whether it's a zero or a one here's
another example if I give you a graph
and node V and a node u and a number K
those are the inputs the question is can
V be reached in fewer than K steps from
you another question is given a graph is
it a tree yes or no for it to be a tree
it needs to be connected and not have
any cycles in it no no loops another
decision problem is given a graph is
there a bridge link somewhere in the
graph an edge that if it gets removed
separates the graph into two separate
pieces given a graph and a number K is
there a pair of nodes that are K steps
apart that the shortest path between
them is no more than K steps now the
question is G bipartite this was a
homework problem or there was a closely
related homework problem where you can
take a graph and try to work out whether
it is separated into two sets of nodes
with edges only going between the sets
now you could argue that in some sense
these problems are all a little bit
silly if we don't often want to know
just one bit of answer we want to know
something like not you know is there a
pair of nodes K steps apart but find me
a pair of nodes K steps apart or is not
just is the graph bipartite but
separated it into the two pieces and
show me what those pieces are or can V
be reached and fewer than K
from you well if it can be show me the
path I would really like to know the
path because that's that's what I'm
gonna be able to work with so an
interesting fact about decision problems
is they're often directly relatable to
the version of the problem that you're
interested in that actually gives the
answer and sometimes you can actually
connect them with only a polynomial
amount of extra work so basically if the
decision problem is efficient so is the
problem that returns the more
interesting input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
