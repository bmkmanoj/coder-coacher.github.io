a little bit let us look at strategy
integration even if the agent selects a
particular strategy it is not
necessarily stuck with a strategy as the
problem-solving evolves it may well
decide to shift from one strategy to
another strategy as an example consider
that for a given problem metacognition
decides to select this strategy of
case-based reasoning now case based
using spawns a number of subtasks
retrieval adaptation evaluation and
storage metacognition can now examine
the requirements will each of the
subtasks and then put each of the
subtasks it may decide on some strategy
for example with the task of adaptation
metacognition with the method of
case-based reasoning recursively or may
pick the matter of rules to adapt a case
or it may use models for the case
adaptation if metacognition picks the
method of rule-based reasoning the note
the metacognition is shifted from the
metal of case-based reasoning overall to
the method of rule-based reasoning for a
sub task of case-based reasoning we can
also use a similar analysis in the next
lower level suppose that metacognition
decides to pick the method of rule-based
reasoning for doing the case adaptation
now the question becomes what rule to
apply rule one two or three we can
imagine matter rules that select which
rule to apply under the given condition
we have come across the use of
metacognition was strategy integration
earlier in this blocks micro world we
saw how means and furnaces can reach a
cul-de-sac when the cul-de-sac happens
metacognition may set up a new reasoning
goal and select the strategy of problem
reduction were resolving the cul-de-sac
when problem reduction then sets up for
independent goals we may revert back to
means-ends analysis to achieve each goal
independently in this particular case we
have integrated means-ends analysis and
problem reduction and the reasoning has
shifted between these two strategies in
a seamless way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
