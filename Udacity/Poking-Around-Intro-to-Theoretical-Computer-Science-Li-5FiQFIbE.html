trees pre-processing and approximation
to solve NP complete problems but
there's one technique that we haven't
yet talked about and that is using
randomness to solve challenging problems
now you know that so far in this course
I have always insisted on finding
guarantees for the performance of
algorithms I wanted to have guarantees
for the running time of the search trees
I even wanted to have guarantees for
approximation so am I ready to give that
up now actually I'm not because even
when we use randomness we can demand
certain guarantees from our algorithms
so one way we could demand a guarantee
from a random algorithm is that we say
it produces the correct or best possible
solution with a certain probability so
best would be in the case of
optimization problems and correct of
course in the case of decision problems
and so will also write this down for
decision problems and finally we could
also say that the algorithm has a
running time that is random and we want
the running time to be polynomial with a
certain probability and of course in
this case here we would be demanding
that the solution is always the best
possible solution or the correct
solution well actually we could also
have combinations of this but then the
algorithm becomes rather weak in my mind
and actually I'm not aware of any
example where I have seen this before
now some of these approaches have
special names this one here is known as
a Monte Carlo algorithm and this one
here is known as a las vegas approach
don't ask me what that says about
casinos in Europe versus casinos in
America because I have no clue now the
two approaches Monte Carlo and Las Vegas
are actually related to each other and
if you think about it for a little while
I think you can figure that out yourself
so my question for you is how I'm
montecarlo algorithms and s Vegas
algorithms related to each other and
I'll give you three choices here is it
that any less Vegas algorithm can be
turned into a Monte Carlo algorithm so
any algorithm over here can be turned
into an algorithm like this is it the
other way around that any multicolor
algorithm can be turned into a las vegas
algorithm or is it even that the two
approaches are roughly speaking of
course more less the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
