on the GPU picking good algorithms
really means picking algorithms that are
fundamentally parallel my favorite
example of this is related to the
example I gave for the CPU where I
compared merge sort which is order n log
in with insertion sort which is order N
squared now in fact most cpu algorithms
text would probably tell you that heap
sort which is also order n log in is a
better choice than either of these it
tends to run a little better on the cpu
but it turns out that heap sort is all
about updating this shared data
structure called the heap and that's
very hard thing to do in parallel and so
in practice a merge sort is a much
better choice on a parallel machine like
the GPU in terms of basic principles for
efficiency we've already discussed some
of these a big one is coalescing global
memory accesses and another is using
shared memory which is faster for
frequently accessed data within a thread
block we'll just touch on a few GPU
ninja topics like optimizing bank
conflicts and shared memory and
optimizing the use of registers I've
certainly seen my share of a sort of GPU
bit twiddling micro optimization one
example that comes to mind is the use of
floating point de norms in order to
abuse the floating point arithmetic
units for additional integer math
performance and this kind of stuff is
just firmly in the ninja category you
know it's almost never worth the time or
the code obfuscation that results and we
won't be talking about them at all today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
