power to define functions once we have
them we can call them with actual
arguments and then inside the function
body we can return with the return value
function bodies are statements which can
contain expressions so we'll be
evaluating or interpreting quite a bit
and this is a lot of power in fact it's
going to turn out that this is really
all you need pretty much to be just as
powerful as any other programming
language recursive functions there's
really that they pack a wallop there's
lot going on and that means that this is
actually a double-edged sword with great
power comes mmm let's say lots of care
that we have to take we've been writing
together in Python a program that
simulates interprets evaluates
JavaScript this means that anything that
JavaScript could do we could also do in
Python because if for some reason we
didn't really know how to write it in
Python we would just leave it in
JavaScript and run our written in Python
JavaScript interpreter spit like that MC
Escher drawing where one hand is drawing
another hand that's actually drawing the
first in a bit of a recursive loop we
can use language a to simulate or
interpret language be so on the one hand
if you'll permit me I can write a Python
program that simulates any JavaScript
program that means that python is at
least as powerful as javascript will
abbreviate javascript with jas it also
turns out not shown here but it's
actually very similar that i could write
in javascript and interpreter for Python
so javascript is at least as powerful as
Python now both of these claims ignore
speed because our interpreter or our web
browser might be a little slower than
just running the appropriate code
natively just as translating natural
language text from Spanish into Mandarin
Chinese take some amount of time but
there's a strong sense in which these
languages are equally expressive any
computation I could carry out in Python
I could also carry out in JavaScript any
computation I could carry out in
JavaScript I could also carry out in
Python I can be just as creative
in either language now one language may
look prettier than another one language
may take a little less time to say a
certain thought to have a creative idea
but ultimately I can express the same
range of work emotions desires in Python
and in JavaScript this is pretty
powerful stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
