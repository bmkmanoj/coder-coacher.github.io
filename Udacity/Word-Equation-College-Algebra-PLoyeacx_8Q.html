glasses wiper sets is going to depend on
the cost to make one wiper set which is
choice a and also the number of wiper
sets total that are made choice C so I
know that a and C are going to fill
letters that go in these boxes but I
need to think about the operator that I
want between them before I can decide
which one goes in the first box which
one in the second or if that order
matters at all in previous lessons we
thought about how total money spent is
equal to the money spent per unit times
the number of units that are being made
so we want to make two glasses wipers
instead of one or going to pay twice as
much money you want to make three wiper
sets we're going to spend three times as
much money and so on and so forth so we
need to multiply these two quantities a
and C together I'm going to go ahead and
fill in a multiplication sign in this
box we learned earlier from the
commutative property of multiplication
that when were multiplying two things
together order doesn't matter so doesn't
matter if i have a or c in this box or a
or c in this box as long as i have one
in one spot and one the other we are
good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
