versus a vertex cover what you have is
the following if you have the smallest
possible vertex cover that means you
have selected a minimum number of
vertices so that each edge is next to at
least one of those vertices if you were
to remove those vertices from a graph
then no edges would remain because every
edge is connected to at least one of
those vertices of the vertex cover so
what remains is always an independent
set and since you've selected the
smallest possible vertex cover so the
smallest number of vertices you need to
remove what remains must be the largest
set or a largest set of independent
vertices and now that discovery is of
course really great news for Alice but
it's also even better news for Carol
whose smile gets a bit bigger and of
course also Bob because what they have
now found out is this clique and
independent set are really closely
connected so if Bob discovers a good or
if any of them discovered discovers a
good algorithm for clique then they have
not only solved clique but also
independent set so if just one of those
two problems is solvable in polynomial
time or in other words if just one of
those two problems turns out to be
tractable then the other problem will be
tractable as well and now we have also
connected vertex cover to independent
set because we basically figured out
that finding the largest possible
independent set for a graph is almost
the same as looking for the smallest
possible vertex cover this also means
that if you can find the smallest
possible vertex cover then you have
found the largest possible independent
set which we already know through
transforming the graph lets you find the
largest possible clique so actually we
can also draw this connection here
because we already know about these two
connections what they have discovered is
something that is commonly known as a
reduction and we'll get more deeply into
that in the next unit what a reduction
is is basically a transformation between
two problems so that if you find out
that one of them is tractable then the
other one is tracked
as well so now the big question is for
clique vertex cover and independent set
are those three problems tractable in
which case Alice Bob and Carol would
really keep smiling or will it turn out
that all of these problems are
intractable in which case Bob Alice and
Carol would tend to be rather unhappy so
which one is it going to be are all
three going to end up very happy are all
three going to end up very sad or is
there maybe something in between you can
find out how that story continues in our
next unit of our introduction to
theoretical computer science plus in the
next unit I'll also tell you how you
could quickly win a million dollar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
