simple harmonic motion in unit 5 that we
decided to bring them back for unit 6 so
for this problem were going to majan we
have a pendulum here and this time it's
not gravity pulling on the pendulum it's
an electric field so the ball here at
the end of the pendulum has some
positive charge Q which causes it to
interact with the electric field in a
way very similar to the gravitational
field we saw before and just to make our
lives easier we're going to assume that
this electric field is constant just
like we were looking at in those
parallel-plate problems all right so my
question to you is how is replacing the
gravitational field with this electric
field going to affect the behavior of
our pendulum well it turns out that even
with an electric field instead of a
gravitational field the pendulum will
still have simple harmonic motion and if
this pendulum is in simple harmonic
motion that means it has some period t
so given that the length of the pendulum
is point 7 5 meters that the mass of the
ball on the end is point zero two
kilograms the electric field has a
constant strength of 10 Newtons per
Coulomb and the charge of the ball on
the end is point zero one coulombs can
you tell me what the period of this
simple harmonic oscillation is going to
be put your answer here in seconds keep
in mind when you're doing this problem
that just like with a normal pendulum
this approximation that it's simple
harmonic motion is actually only true
for small angles theta and that's the
same case here so when you're working on
this problem you can safely assume that
we're only dealing with small values of
theta all right good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
