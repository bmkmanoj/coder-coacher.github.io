applications where you inherently have
to deal with more than one table right
earlier in the course you mentioned that
doing joins was a very bad idea and
could be very expensive yeah and how do
you get around that when you inherently
are dealing with different types of dish
or sure sure ok so that's another
interesting question and it's the answer
isn't super simple you know an app
engine you can't do joints but you can
also store complicated objects that have
kind of nested structures so you can get
around so you know you can have lists
for example as a property in your App
Engine object so you can actually get
around a lot of the need for joins by
using that sort of thing but let's say
you're just using sequel and you want to
scale it across many machines joins are
really tough which means having these
foreign relationships in your database
are really tough and and and the way it
was facing the question is basically
like we store data on multiple places to
avoid multiple queries the answer is
sometimes yes other times you do
multiple queries and what I usually do
when I'm writing this sort of thing is I
just cash the bejesus out of all of my
queries so and I try to structure all of
my queries to have generally the same
structure which is look up something by
ID or by a very few number of
constraints so for example if we're
loading reddits front page I'll do a
query for you know for each of the
reddits to get there the the top post in
each reddit and then I'll merge them and
that'll be cached and so from then on
I'll just pull from that cash and then
you notice all these extra little
properties that each link can have per
user did you like it did you or I mean
did you upload it did you download it
did you save it you know did you submit
it you know all of those things I
probably do another query to a separate
table to get all that information for
that user and then I'll cash that so
that in the future most of that stuff is
just bouncing off memcached and you know
the first version read it we actually
did a big join there and it just became
too slow and these and the users table
with all this information you know
uploads and downloads and all that stuff
you know move to its own machine so we
couldn't do joins easily anymore so yeah
it turned into multiple queries
sometimes storing extra little pieces of
information in different places so it
makes your rights more expensive and a
little bit more complex but it makes
your reads while more numerous
simpler and easier to cash because if
you keep your queries to basically key
value those screws are very very fast
and they're also very easy to cash you
know just key to value it mirrors what
your your cash is doing so it's actually
a complicated question with a
complicated answer and you know what you
just need to be thinking is what makes
sense in a particular situation there's
certainly a situation where you know the
feature is never going to be a big scale
and you can just put everything in one
database and use joins and do it that
way if you want you just need to kind of
have in mind you know how big is this
going to be and how many of these
decisions do i need to make right now
versus just getting it working so I hope
that helps there isn't a you know an
easy answer to that because every
problem is a little bit different so you
know do what works best do what works
for now and you know if you have to
scale it later good luck congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
