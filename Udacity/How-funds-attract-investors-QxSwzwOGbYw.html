that you want to be a hedge fund manager
and one of your first tasks as a hedge
fund manager is to get investors so who
might your investors be there are three
major types of investors and hedge funds
of course there's others besides these
but these are the three main types
individuals in other words a single
person that wants to invest in a fund of
course these are typically very wealthy
folks keep in mind that hedge funds
typically can only have up to 100
investors so they want each of those
investments to be fairly large so that
they can manage of course you know a
significant amount of funds so the
individuals who invest in hedge funds
are typically as I said very wealthy
institutions what do I mean by
institution these are things like very
large retirement funds like CalPERS out
in California
these are university foundations like
the Harvard University Foundation or the
Georgia Tech foundation in other words
institutions very often nonprofit
institutions that have a large sum of
money that they need to keep somewhere
and of course they'd like to see an
accrual and value so that's one reason
they look to hedge funds and finally
funds of funds what funds of funds do is
they group together the funds of many
individuals or institutions so for
instance you might be an individual that
could say invest in one hedge fund but
you'd really like to get the advantage
of investing in several funds so you
might allow your money to be collected
by a manager of funds of funds and then
that manager would gather together all
these assets and pick carefully several
hedge funds to invest that money in so
besides knowing who your investors might
be it's critically important to know why
they might invest in your fund
how can you present the case to them
that will convince them that they should
let you manage their
here are at least some of the criteria
that folks like this would consider
before investing in a hedge fund track
record so if your fund has a great track
record that's of course some of the best
evidence that it's going to continue to
work well many institutional investors
will want to see a good track record for
at least five years before they'll
invest in a particular fund now if
you're a young whippersnapper hedge fund
manager and you don't have five years
yet what are you going to do well what
you can do is simulate or backtest your
strategy and investors will consider
these simulations but that simulation
has to be backed by a very compelling
story describing that strategy in other
words you've got to have a reason for
why this method works and it needs to
make sense
and finally they consider how your
strategy fits within their portfolio in
other words if your strategy is for
large cap S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks and they've
already got that covered with another
fund they might not consider you however
if you for instance are looking at small
cap growth stocks and they don't yet
have that part of their portfolio filled
they'll give you some more thought</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
