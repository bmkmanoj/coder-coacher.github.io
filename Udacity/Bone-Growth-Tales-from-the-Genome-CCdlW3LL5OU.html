growing inside the bone are fgfr3
positive cells what this means if we
zoomed in really close is that these
cells in red here if we looked very
close up here's the cell membrane this
red protein here is the fgfr3 protein we
have two proteins right here and they're
embedded in the membrane as you can
imagine proteins in the membrane are
important because they're what
communicate from the outside world to
the inside world now if there are
actually two fgfr3 proteins like this
they're considered inactive nothing is
happening because the only way the fgfr3
protein can do anything is if it's bound
to its favorite partner protein fgf 3
the RN fgfr3 stands for receptor because
it receives the signal from fgf 3 it's
like it's serving as a docking platform
so these 2 fgfr3 proteins can get close
together and once they're close together
then there's a signal that's sent to
slow down bone growth so normally these
cells in red that are fgfr3 positive are
growing and dividing and contributing to
the cells in the long bone helping it
grow longer but there's a signal that
comes from the environment that is
transmitted through the fgfr3 protein so
that whenever the fgf 3 protein is
around it's a signal that says whoa slow
down guys slow down your bone growth now
what happens in the case of the G 1138 a
mutation the missense mutation is that
right here in this region where the
protein spans across the cell membrane
that's where the amino acid change has
happened and now this fgfr3 protein
doesn't have to wait for fgf 3 it can
form this pair what we call a
dimerization dimer dye meaning two here
even when there's no protein partner to
facilitate the interaction right we
don't see that yellow protein here
connecting the two fgfr3
so this means we're gonna slow down bone
growth like we normally would but now
what's going to happen even when the fgf
3 isn't around so the net
affect our bones that grow shorter than
they normally would because the fgfr3
protein is going to be slowing bone
growth down even when the fgf 3 isn't
around it means that this protein is
sort of always on now overall this
results in a form of short limb dwarfism
called achondroplasia if you want to
know where the name comes from a
conjurus site is what we call a bone
cell a Kandra site so the Kandra part is
what we're referring to as bone here
pleasure means growth so Kandra pleasure
means bone growth in a Kandra pleasure
means the absence or the loss of so the
loss of bone growth and that's what
dwarfism is in this sense a person with
achondroplasia will have shorter limbs
and overall be a shorter person with a
distinctive facial structure also due to
altered bone development of the skull so
would you categorize this allele here
the G 1138 a allele as a loss of
function a gain of function or no change
in function allele</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
