significance test useful so they do
provide a formalized framework for
comparing and evaluating data and they
do enable us to evaluate whether
perceived effects in our dataset reflect
differences across the whole population
they do not make a batters all look good
significance tests are useful because
they provide a formalized framework for
comparing and evaluating data different
tests have different assumptions and
rules that they incorporate and using a
particular test ensures that everyone is
on the same page insofar as what we're
assuming about our data significance
tests also enable us to evaluate whether
perceived affects on our data set
reflect differences across the whole
population as was the case with our
company we're a 10 out of 10 people
polled preferred the color blue
sometimes an effect that we see in a
small sample does not reflect what might
be true across the entire population a
statistical significance test lets us
formally determine whether or not this
might be the case unfortunately a bad
result is not going to look any better
or worse as a result of using a
statistical significance test if our
data is bad or there's really no
difference between our two samples we're
not going to be able to undo that with a
test it is possible though that
different tests might give us different
results the really important thing and
we'll go into this a bit more is that
you need to use the right tests in the
right situations why don't we talk a
little bit about how we might actually
run a statistical significance test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
