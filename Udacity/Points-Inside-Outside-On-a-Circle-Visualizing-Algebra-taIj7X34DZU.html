this point is on the circle and this
point is outside the circle great work
if you got all four of them correct now
if you weren't sure where to start let's
look at this first point and see why
it's on the circle then you might be
able to figure out why these are inside
and this one's outside remember that
this is really just a right triangle in
space it has some horizontal distance X
and some vertical distance Y so we want
to be sure that when we plug in the
values for X like negative six and the
value of y like positive eight we get a
hundred so squaring negative six and
squaring eight will get 36 Plus 64 which
equals 100 so yes it turns out that this
statement is true this means that the
point negative six eight is a point on
our circle since it satisfies the
equation we also know that this point is
on our circle since we can set up a
right triangle the point negative 6 8 is
six units left from the origin and eight
units up if we use the Pythagorean
theorem here we'll discover that this
side or this radius is 10 this should
also make sense because we really have a
3 4 5 triangle the triangle has just
been multiplied by 2 to give us a 6 8 10
triangle so we know that the distance
from the origin to this point is 10
units and that matches with our idea
that any point on our circle is 10 units
from the center so by checking the point
in our calculations or by drawing out a
diagram we can know that this point is
definitely on our circle for this point
it turns out it will be inside when we
check the point negative 9 4 we'll plug
in X with the value of negative 9 and
we'll substitute the value of y with 4
simplifying the left hand side of our
equation will get 97 we know that's not
equal to 100 and in fact this is less
than 100 since negative 9 squared plus 4
squared equals in 97 we really know that
we're inside the circle remember that 10
is the radius of our circle it's
square root of this number so this means
the distance from the origin to this
point is the square root of 97 which is
definitely less than 10 the right
triangle for this point would look like
this we'd have 9 units to the left of
the origin and then 4 units up this
point would just be shy of reaching our
circle we know that the distance from
the origin to this point is the square
root of 97 it's the square root of this
number we really want this distance to
be 10 or the square root of 100 and it's
not it's less than that so that's how we
know this point is inside the circle the
same would be true for the point 7 comma
negative 7 if we plug in X with the
value of 7 and Y with the value of
negative 7 we'll get the statement 98
equals 100 this isn't true so we know
that the distance from the origin to
this point is less than 10 so this point
must be inside and finally for this
point when we plug in X with the value
of 5 and Y with the value of 9 we'll get
a hundred and six equal to 100 this
isn't true and we know 106 is greater
than 100 that means that the distance of
5 9 from the origin is greater than 10
the point 5 9 would be just outside of
our circle we can even see this on
desmos here's the equation of our circle
and we can see that the point negative 6
8 is on it even if we zoom in we can
quickly see that yes the point is on the
circle and then this other point
negative 9 4 isn't it's just slightly
inside of our circle the other point
that we said was inside the circle is 7
negative 7 this point down here zooming
in on this region we see that it's just
shy of being on the circle and that
should make sense because we found that
the distance from the origin to this
point was the square root of 98 almost
the square root of 100 which is 10 to
the circle and finally we looked at the
point 5 comma 9 this orange point out
here zooming in we see that yes
just outside of our circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
