you take feedback and how you figure out
how you incorporate that feedback into
your business I think the most important
thing is as an entrepreneur can you take
a step back can you back away from like
that maybe a narrow problem you're
trying to solve right now and really
look at the big picture and can you take
the feedback that's coming in and apply
it to the big picture without being so
distracted and from what's happening cut
in the weeds in particular for
early-stage companies if you look at the
founders and the co-founders you know
they're selling the product they're
building the product or marketing that
they're doing customer service and
sometimes you can get so focused on the
detail that when somebody provides you
feedback you don't you don't understand
how to take it unless you can really
step back and that's an important
attribute of a founder is can you step
back from all of the detail that you're
working on and incorporate the feedback
that's coming in and change directions
if you need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
