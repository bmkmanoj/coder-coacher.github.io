integrated development environment and
it's what we'll be using to create our
scripts and to create plots
it's a point-and-click system that
organizes our workspace and it has some
nice features for creating and sharing
work here's a basic tour of it the main
interface contains four panels that can
be resized as needed
now you may only see three panels when
you open our studio if so just open a
newer script by clicking on the file and
the new file our scripts so in the top
left here we have our scripts these are
the files in which we will type our our
commands we'll also save these files so
we can alter them or share them at a
later time in the bottom left we have
the our console you can type in our
commands here however these are commands
will only be saved in a temporary
history the commands won't be saved to a
file like up and here that can be
reviewed at a later date in the top
right of our studio we have two tabs one
called environment and one called
history the environment will contain all
the objects functions and values that
are in the current working memory for
our history on the other hand we'll keep
a running log of any of the our commands
that we run now we can run our scripts
directly from our files but we can also
type them in in the console no matter
which way we type them in the history
we'll capture them and finally in the
lower right we have the files plots
packages help and viewer section you'll
learn more about these later but this is
where our plots or graphs will first
appear when we run an our command that
creates a visualization now that we've
gone over the layout of our studio I
want you to match some actions that you
might do in each panel of our remember
this first panel is for our files our
our our scripts the second area was for
the workspace or the history this third
space was the console where we get our
output and this fourth panel is for
files packages plots and help so for
example if I asked you to match the
activity to one of these panels like
save and our script that would
correspond to box number one you can
save them by clicking on this button
now we could of course use the main menu
but I'm not going to include that as any
one of your options here the main
purpose of this quiz is just to get you
familiar with our studio so here your
list of action
and I want you to pair it with the panel
where you would do it in our studio put
the number of the corresponding panel in
each of the boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
