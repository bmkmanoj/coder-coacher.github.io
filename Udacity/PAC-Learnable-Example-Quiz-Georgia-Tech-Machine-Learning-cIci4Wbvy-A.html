able to to go back to that question that
we looked at before so let's look at it
a little bit differently this time so if
our hypothesis space is the set of
functions that take 10 bit inputs and
there's a hypothesis corresponding to
returning each of those 10 bits separate
hypotheses one returns the first bit one
returns the second bit and so on and now
we have a target of epsilon equal to 0.1
so we would like to return a hypothesis
whose error is less than or equal to 0.1
and we want to be pretty sure of it the
error or failure probability needs to be
less than or equal to 0.2 and let's just
say for concreteness that our
distribution over inputs is uniform okay
so given the setup how many samples do
we need to pack learn this hypothesis
set okay and remember the algorithm that
we're going to use is we're going to
draw a sample of the size that we want
then we are going to be confident that
we've epsilon exhausted that that
version space and so anything that left
in the version space should have low
error and that procedure should fail
with probability no more than point two
right so it's a succeeded probability
point yeah we're better okay do you
think we could work that through I think
we can all right let's do it okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
