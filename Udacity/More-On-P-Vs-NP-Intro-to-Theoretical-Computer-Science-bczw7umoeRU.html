finding a polynomial time algorithm for
an np-complete problem yes that would
show that P equals NP because the
problem is np-complete so it means it's
among the hardest to solve problems in
NP so polynomial time algorithm for this
problem will solve any other np-complete
problem in polynomial time as well
finding an algorithm that solves an
np-complete problem in polynomial time
on average now that's a very interesting
one because you might be inclined to
think well if it solves an np-complete
problem in polynomial time on average
then probably that is sufficient well it
shows a lot of interesting things but it
doesn't show anything with respect to P
being equal to NP or P not being equal
to NP now showing that the most
efficient algorithm for clique requires
exponential time that would show that P
does not equal NP because clique is
contained in NP so if it requires
exponential time it means that there's
at least one problem namely clique that
is contained in NP but not in P of
course as nice as it would be to show
this of course it would also be quite
difficult to prove this because you
would have to show that again no matter
what algorithm you come up with it
always requires exponential time that
will be extremely hard to do because you
would have to consider any algorithm
even algorithms that haven't been
invented yet so to say now showing that
vertex cover has an exponential number
of potential solutions that is similar
to the example ended out to you in the
beginning of this unit namely that just
having an exponential number of
potential solutions does not mean that
the problem is hard it can mean that the
problem is hard but as you've seen in
the case of shortest path it's not
necessarily so now reducing clique to
shortest path versus reducing shortest
path to clique then you have to remember
again what reduction means so if you
reduce clique to shortest path it means
that solving the shortest path problem
is also capable of solving the clique
problem
and since shortest path is solvable in
polynomial time if you manage to reduce
clique to shortest path that would show
that P equals NP if on the other hand
you manage to reduce shortest path to
clique
that doesn't really have any
implications because all you've shown is
that shortest path is an easier problem
than clique which is something we
already know now if you look at all
these solutions well of course it's it's
a bit of a subjective selection here but
what you see that is showing that P
equals NP in a way would be quite easy
all you have to do is find one single
polynomial time algorithm for an
np-complete problem then you have
immediately shown that P equals NP on
the other hand if you want to show that
P does not equal NP then you have to put
in a lot of work because you have to
consider any possible algorithm no
matter how complex how intelligent how
sophisticated and still somehow make the
case that this algorithm is not able to
solve a problem that clique in
polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
