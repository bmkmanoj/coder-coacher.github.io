consider is tomasulo's algorithm it's
really one of the first techniques for
out of order execution and now it's more
than 40 years old it was used in the old
IBM 360 machines which are now again
more than 40 years old what it does is
it determines which instructions have
inputs ready so that they can go in the
next cycle and which instructions still
have to wait for their inputs to be
produced it also includes a form of
register renaming and it is surprisingly
similar to what we actually use today as
far as out of order execution is
concerned so although this is more than
40 years old it actually is very useful
to know how it works because it's kind
of like the first approach so it's
simpler than what we use today but it
really well explains what's going on the
differences between tomasulo's algorithm
and what is used today are only that in
the olden days when tomasulo's algorithm
was implemented they did that only for
floating-point instructions while today
we do it for all instructions also they
had relatively few instructions in the
window that they are looking at meaning
they only really looked over some small
number of instructions into the you know
future instructions that need to be
executed well today we look at hundreds
of instructions pass the one we are
still executing in the olden days
exception handling for floating-point
instructions was not such a big problem
because they were only considering
really in execution of kind of
floating-point intensive applications
and you know those would be programmed
and so on and you would usually run one
program at a time if there is an
exception you could do some drastic
measures
today processors include explicit
support for exception handling that we
will see later so we will first again
look at how the tomasulo's algorithm did
it and then we will consider how today's
processors do these additional things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
