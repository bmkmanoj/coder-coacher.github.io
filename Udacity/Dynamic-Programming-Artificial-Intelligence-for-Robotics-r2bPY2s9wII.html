method for planning in this alternative
method has a number of advantages and a
number of disadvantages it's called
dynamic programming and just like a star
it's gonna find you a shortest path you
give it a map of the environment as an
a-star one or more goal positions let's
assume just one goal position where the
outputs is the best path from any
possible starting location so this
planning technique is not just limited
to a single start location but to any
star location why would be worried about
this let me give you an example suppose
you are the Google self-driving car in
an environment just like this and you in
this little Street over here and you ask
to turn right but your goal is right
over here and as before there's two
different lanes over here a left turn
lane in a straight line and if you reach
the straight lane the only way to get to
the goal is to go on the block over here
and proceed in this direction you've
seen this example before now the point I
want to make is a different one that is
your attempt to do a lane shift over
here might fail why would it fail well
it could be there is a big big truck in
this lane over here and as you go into
the right lane when you're waiting for
the truck disappear there's these people
behind you that honk their horns and you
either want to wait for the truck to
disappear what that means as the
environment is stochastic the outcomes
of actions are non-deterministic in our
planning so far we ignore this but in
reality that's the case in reality you
might find yourself wow I'm over here
how did that happen well it happened
because the world is stochastic and this
truck over here this stupid truck didn't
let you in what that means is you need a
plan not just for the most likely
position but you might need a plan for
other positions as well
so what dynamic programming gives you is
a plan for every position if we redraw
this environment as a grid
with a go location and certain obstacles
then the normal programming gives you an
optimal action to do at every single red
cell and as you can see each grid Sano
has a label that label is often called
policy and policy is a function that
map's
the grid cell into an action with the
action in this case is a move left move
down move right or move up so now we
will compute a policy using dynamic
programming that is given a grid word
like this and a gold state like that we
will write software that will output for
each of the navigable cells what the
best thing to do is to do should the
robot find itself there and that
requires a different algorithm than a
star it happens to be a more computation
involved I with them and as I said
before it's called
dynamic programming for robot path
