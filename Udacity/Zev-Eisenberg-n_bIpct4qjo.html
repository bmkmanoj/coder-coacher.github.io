at Udacity and I'm here with hi I'm Jeff
I work at race labs in Boston where I'm
an iOS developer and design groupie zebb
so I want to I want to step back to the
beginning of your engineering career how
did you how did you first get started
learning computer science I wouldn't say
that I necessarily learned computer
science I thought I was going to go to
school for film making and I started the
new media program at the University of
Maine and they have a broad selection of
intro classes and one of them is
programming and I sort of took to it so
I kind of the filmmaking fell by the
wayside and they got more and more into
programming and what was your when did
you start working with iOS pretty much
as soon as the SDK came out I I knew it
was coming out I had been following
Apple for a long time and I knew that
object-oriented programming was this big
thing that they were pushing I was like
well what is that I don't know what that
is so I took a class in object-oriented
programming in Java
at school sort of to prepare for that
and then just started doing iOS pretty
much self-taught from then using the
Stanford course and Stack Overflow a lot
from the very beginning yes sort of iOS
self-taught what was your first step I
did some apps in school things I was in
a class where we were studying
multi-touch which was pretty new at the
time there were the this was before the
iPad so iPhone was out iPad wasn't yet
there were those big touch tables that
Microsoft and other people were sort of
thinking maybe this will be the next big
thing so we designed a card game with a
group of students we designed a digital
card game on a big touch table where the
idea was can we can we get people to use
their existing knowledge of how a
physical deck of card works deck of
cards works to inform how they interact
with cards in the virtual world so if if
we think they're likely to interact with
cards by picking them up a certain way
can we try to interpret those gestures
so that they don't have to think about
what they're doing whoa cool did it work
it we learned a lot
what we learned is that the gestures
that we predicted that people would use
were too restrictive so we built
something when the iPad came out shortly
after we started this we scrapped the
touch table and one with like that and
we built a system of gestures where we
thought well maybe if you're going to
move a card you'll use two fingers on
the outside and you can pick up a deck
this way and maybe you'll spin maybe
you'll flip the card so we built
gestures for those and we brought the we
brought our prototype to different age
groups we brought it into a middle
school and we asked them okay how are
you gonna flip a card over and they all
DoubleTap the card even though we told
them this is a real deck of cards they
they're so familiar with digital stuff
and with iPods that they were all doubly
having we brought it into a Senior
Center they were in the middle of a
bridge tournament and we said hey can we
can you try this out for a second and
they would we asked them to flip a card
over and they would put their finger on
the car to pull it towards them and lift
their finger up off the screen and you
could kind of see in their eyes there
was a flash of surprise that the card
didn't come with them and we were sort
of resistant to that for a long time we
were thinking well there's no way that
we can interpret that but I think we
probably could if this were something we
were gonna pursue and keep working on
right I think there would be a way to
figure out based on like philosophy you
come towards the screen and then come
off it differential pressure yeah oh
yeah especially with the new pressure
stuff I think you could do it and I
think our main takeaway there was that
your users are always going to surprise
you but if you can figure out if
somebody does an action and you know
what they're trying to do don't tell
them they're wrong just just make your
app respond to them make your app do
what they're trying to do that seems
like a really hard problem addressing
the needs of middle schoolers well at
the same time addressing the needs of
seniors how have you solved that problem
in the past so I think this happened
particulars on the high end of the
spectrum for the broad range of people
we need to work with but in general I
think testing like do usability testing
with people from all the different age
groups with people with disabilities
like get as broad a range
of test subjects as you can and really
listen closely to what they're saying
because they're gonna say stuff that is
exactly opposite of your core
assumptions about the product and it's
really hard to not resist that to say no
you're wrong you're interpreting this
wrong you need to you need to take what
they're saying and not judge it
immediately and then go back and think
about it and try and figure out can you
make changes to your thing so that it
will work better with their assumptions
yeah so give your give your users a
chance to speak and really listen within
iOS do you feel like you have a
specialty are there certain kinds of
problems that you're naturally drawn
toward yeah for me it's finicky details
of UI it's you know when you navigate in
a push animation and then you tap the
back button as you navigate back the
cell will unhighlight but as you if you
never get back with a swipe gesture it
will unhighlight as a function of the
percentage of the drag so if you drag a
bit and then drag back it will start to
rehire and there's a subtle bug on iOS
where that doesn't always behave exactly
the same in all situations and chasing
down so noticing things like that and
then chasing them down and teasing them
apart and figuring out like what what is
actually the intended behavior here why
is it the intended behavior and how can
we best support it so that users aren't
distracted by it those are those are
usually the types of things that people
on my team come to me for they're like
hey I have this really weird little
fiddly like what's what's going on here
this picture doesn't look quite right
but I don't understand why interesting
so somewhere between like a UX
specialist and a design engineer yeah
yeah I my first job I was a half iOS
engineer and half designer sort of
straddling that world and being the
person who would run around between
designers and developers and translate
each other for them so here at all comp
you gave a talk on bomb oh yeah can you
tell us a little bit about how it works
sure so bomb oh is a library for making
attributed strings a pleasure to work
with
with the goal of making beautiful
typography on ILS so attributed string
is great it's really powerful you can do
amazing typographical things anybody
who's just come out of design school and
whose head is full of all these kerning
and letting and tracking and the
character alternates and all that stuff
attributed string on iOS can do all of
that but it's super finicky to work with
it's a complex and multifaceted API you
need to know is this in the attributed
string or is there paragraph style do I
need to make a phone descriptor there's
a lot of sort of cognitive load that a
lot of especially like project leads
aren't necessarily going to know if
they're more generalists and so a
designer will come up to you and say hey
can we just track that out a little bit
just to increase the letter spacing and
you don't want to have to say that's not
really gonna make the cut for this
release because it's hard to do you want
to just be able to say sure I can do
that so that's the goal of bundo how
long has it been out it's been out I
checked in get the other day it's been
out a year in two months so what are
some examples of some apps that use it
so let's see we shipped it in the app
for invaluable which is an online
auction app that we did at race labs the
app that caused it to come into
existence was undercover tourist which
is an app for amusement park enthusiasts
I didn't actually get to use Bonomo in
undercover tourists because by the time
we'd finish the project and shipped it
that's when I started working on budmo
and we never got a chance to go back and
and use it but on a on app like that
today I would definitely use it and I
used it pretty much exclusively on my
last two apps which haven't shipped yet
for iOS which one of which I can talk
about which is Perkins School for the
Blind it's an app to help blind people
find bus stops and we're using it in
that well yeah I heard one of your your
teammates give a talk on that totally
totally an amazing project yeah this was
like a maybe you can summarize the
project sure so GPS is amazing for blind
people because it can tell you where you
are which is you know sort of core thing
you would need to know but it can only
so if you're trying to get to a bus stop
for example it can only get you to
within sort of 25 or 30 feet it's not
accurate enough to get you right there
so you have this problem where you might
think you're at a bus stop but the bus
stop is over there
and then the bus drives by because
you're not standing right at the bus
stop so the solution that the Perkins
app uses is to crowdsource hyperlocal
data so it gets you near the bus stop
and then it'll tell you with the screen
reader with voiceover and iOS if you're
approaching the bus stop with the screen
on your left there's a bench and then
there's a trashcan then the bus stop is
mounted on a concrete a concrete pole
with a square shape so if you feel it
you can tell the shape it is and then if
you get to the tree you've gone too far
and so that data is gathered mostly by
sighted users and then used by blind
people who are trying to find a stop
interesting so I wonder if the sighted
users are the sighted users noticing the
landmarks that are still most useful to
the non sighted users yeah that's a good
question we we did a bunch of testing to
sort of figure out some of that and the
app prompts you it doesn't just have
free text entry it prompts you with
lists of things that are likely to be
around bus stops based on it it's in
Boston right now and we based it on like
going out and looking at bus stops and
figuring out what are the types of
objects that might be relevant to a
blind persons they could feel like it
since the texture with the cane or by
feeling it and so the lists are
pre-populated with that kind of stuff
there's also a free text entry if you
need it but it should help guide you to
providing useful information like the
pole shapes we found some interesting
edge cases like one of the options for
pole shape was a u-shaped pole so this
would be a flat metal sign with the
sides bent in so it has a sort of
u-shaped cross section but you shaped
and doesn't mean anything to somebody
who reads Braille right so we had to
change it to a pole that's open on one
side
yeah
I think I would notice that was that was
another example of you know user
surprising you right and also Chris
Hogue talked about in his in his talk
that a case where our mental model was
completely wrong
from how an app user was gonna use it
because we were looking at the sign as
though we were looking through the sign
to the street so the things works as a
left of the sign and to the right of the
sign and so the app told somebody
there's a driveway to the right of the
sign and he we have this video of our
testing session with him he said well
what I don't understand that that's
impossible how could it be to the right
of the sign because he's picturing
walking along the sidewalk with the
street to the side of him right and so a
driveway or some other obstacle is gonna
be either in front of or behind the sign
and it's hard that's another case where
it's really hard to tease out what
people are thinking people have
completely different mental models of
the things that we all think are things
that we share in common and you've got
to really dig deep to to get past the
language that we share to like what are
you actually talking about here and
realize that you're talking about
something completely different in
language that we both think we
understand to mean the same thing right
so it was only through user testing that
you could figure out that your users are
perpendicular their exact model is
perpendicular to exactly or I know we
can't tell them or wrong we got to
change the app yeah and we did it's so
cool so do you have a so it's not out
out yet right right it's in beta so that
we can gather a full set of data for
Boston from sighted users and then
believe it's gonna go out after that
cool and do you have do you have blind
users testing it now as well yeah so
we're working with the Perkins School
for the Blind and they've been working
with us closely on testing it and giving
feedback and I also got great feedback
from the accessibility labs at WWC
brought it thoroughly if you ever have a
chance to bring specific questions and
problems to the WWC labs and the by
appointment design reviews it's
amazingly valuable that leads into sort
of is that one of the reasons why you
come to these conferences
to get to get the chance to talk to
Apple engineers yeah in general what do
you like about these conferences so the
sessions are great but they're also now
streamed and downloadable so right now
while I'm here most of the Iowas team
back in Boston and the one here in
Oakland are watching the sessions and
taking notes and it's relaxed and they
can pause them and so I'm not really
spending much time in the sessions I'm
I'm just going to the labs I've got a
list of I think 19 questions that my
teammates have sent me and they they
keep posting more and I'm just running
around the labs tracking down engineers
trying to get specific answers doing
follow-ups really digging into these
questions and figuring out what's going
on it's also a great sort of networking
opportunity I meet a lot of cool people
I see friends who I've met at other
conferences yeah that's my favorite part
is the networking and you've got you've
had luck getting all your questions
answered the questions yeah well
questions from out or answers from Apple
or often please file a bug but it's it's
a good way to get your problem in front
of the person who worked on the thing
and maybe phrase your question in a way
that is harder to convey in writing and
say like I don't think you really gave
this question or this bug a fair shot
here's why we think this would be really
valuable and maybe show them some new
angle so they might rethink something we
also at my last job iOS 6 introduced an
issue where our Wi-Fi basically didn't
work for a year and I you would get on
the network and then after a few minutes
on the network on iOS 6 and Mac OS 10
point 7 you would get massive packet
loss it was basically unusable you had
to restart the network are you on your
device and after like I found some
radars they were closed or sort of
ignored and I brought it to the labs and
I was like this is really a problem for
us can you please is there anything you
can do and they reopened it and they
give us some diagnostics to run and then
they said hey can you try checking this
box in your Cisco router settings
there's some like a media packet
optimization thing and we checked the
box
and then it worked oh my god so
you know it's labs WBC labs saved their
company from broken networking Wow
speaking of sending questions to people
we have some questions from our students
so I want to read one to you
let me grab it really quick okay this
question is from Leo he's in the iOS
they have no degree at Udacity and he
says how do you step out of a rut I've
been working on a bug for the last three
days I've done all that I can think of
to fix it but it still won't work I feel
like I need a different approach to
tackle this problem has something
similar ever happened to you yeah that
happens to me all the time
probably every couple weeks depending on
what I'm working on so change your
location
move somewhere else in your office or
wherever you're working and go for a
walk stop step away from the keyboard
give it overnight sleep on it go for a
walk outside and change your scenery
talk to people talking through a problem
like explaining a problem to somebody
else is a fantastic way to debug it
either from getting help from them or
just forcing yourself to phrase it in a
way that you can convey it to another
human by vibrating it the air between
you it can be a really good way to get
yourself to formulate the question in a
different way yeah forcing yourself to
explain it step by step
yeah and then of course the the higher
the higher level of enlightenment for
programmer is to get rid of the other
person and get a rubber ducky to the
rubber ducky and so that you can save
your teammates some time but I think
talking through it is certainly
something that helps me that was the
only question we had from our students
and I'm wondering do you normally code
in Swift or objective-c its Swift for
all new projects at race labs unless we
have a really good reason not to I'm
working on this open source library bono
which is written in Objective C because
that's what I was using at the time I
wrote it and it makes it easier to
support compatibility with Objective C
and Swift projects and I want to support
developers who are locked in to
objective-c because of big old code
bases so I'm not ready to port it just
yet but I will
sort of a couple years down the line
when it's with this a bit more prevalent
so most of our students are learning iOS
development for the first time in sweat
mhm what advice would you give them what
would advice would you give the sort of
intermediate programmer who's learned
iOS development and Swift and now
they're not sure how much time to spend
learning Objective C sure so learning
iOS by learning Swift first terrifies me
because I learned Objective C first and
learning iOS development with arc
without learning manual memory
management terrifies me because I
learned on manual memory management so
the way that I think about problems with
memory and everything related to the
system is sort of locked into the way
that I learned it but it's kind of cool
that people are now learning on Swift
first because it does leave a lot of
baggage behind and it really makes you
think hard about what you're trying to
express to the compiler it maybe makes
it a little bit harder to just sort of
throw some code in and get it working
which again based on the way that I
learned it is terrifying because that's
how I learned Objective C is like throw
some stuff in the compiler won't tell me
what I'm doing wrong I've got to sort of
run it and try and figure it out and
hopefully is the error reporting gets
better it'll be more clear earlier as
you're typing code what's what you're
doing wrong but also still just throw
stuff at the wall and see what sticks
like try hack together the ugly solution
you can and just get the thing working
and then work on trying to improve it
and make it beautiful yeah that's not
really possible influence because you
have to be so specific about what type
you are using for what purpose yeah and
there's always the danger that
something's going wrong and it's not
your fault in Swift because the the
tooling is not as mature as it is with
epoxy but it's getting there and it's
getting there fast do you think that
Swift is a good language for is a good
first programming language is a good
language for people to learn if they've
never
line of code in their lives I think so
from what I've heard from people who
have started out learning Swift when I
think about that on my mind immediately
jumps to all the edge cases and all the
weird things where like the thing with
learning programming it's pretty easy to
teach like here's the loop here's a
conditional okay now you're a programmer
the things that were annoying to me when
I was learning programming were weight
floating-point numbers do what now and
all the all the weirdness all the
garbage that comes from the fact that
this is not a pure logical system this
is we're dealing with computers we're
dealing with silicon and there's gross
--mess to be had there and I think Swift
probably leaves most of that gross Ness
as far under the covers as is reasonable
similar to a language like processing
which is based on Java but gets rid of a
lot of the awful system dot out dot
print line stuff and and makes it really
clean and pure to write little programs
that do graphical things I think Swift
is very similar it's really clean to do
simple things and you're not gonna run
into those gross edge cases that make
you question your existence and wonder
like wait how do computers work again
how is any of this even working is that
a good thing it was like when is that a
good thing and when is that not a good
thing yeah and there are certainly
people who you know learned assembly
first or learn very low-level things
first who are gonna be horrified than
anybody's learning a high-level language
first it's you know it's the kids it's
the kids these days fallacy so you're
you're always gonna you're always gonna
be cruisin along and find stuff that
makes you question all your assumptions
I think where Swift draws those lines is
probably in a good place if it mostly
does stuff you would expect and then in
the places where you normally have
gotchas things like various types of
casting and coercion that could surprise
you in other languages it makes it hard
to mess those up because it makes you be
pretty explicit about like this is a
floating point this is an integer you
need to do some stuff you need to think
about what you're actually trying to say
here it's really hard to act though not
impossible it's hard to do division and
expect to get a floating point actually
get an integer
except in some cases in the first place
yeah when I was learning programming I
made all those mistakes I think many
though not all of those are obviated by
swift they're they're harder to make I
think you there will still be cases
where you have to go read the thing
that's like every things about
floating-point numbers that every
programmer should know if you didn't
study that in school you're gonna have
to go learn that at some point but I
think for the most part in most cases
also because people the things people
are writing a Swifter are sort of more
things in you eyes for now and you know
it's moving towards the server and
things but the details of floating point
numbers and things like that are less
relevant when you're moving Windows
around on the screen what are some of
the most exciting announcements coming
out of WWDC for you this year
for me it's got to be the tooling the
improvements to Xcode and the build
stuff in the Swift open-source progress
I got to try out Android studio recently
I've never done an Android programming
and I wrote a feature on an iOS app that
was mostly of matrix math so so very
little language dependent stuff and I
thought well this would be fun where
there's a crop cross-platform project
I'm gonna try porting it to Android pull
out my java from college and the tooling
stuff in Android studio is really
impressive it's fast the compiler
doesn't randomly crash while you're
doing stuff it does the auto importing
and it has just in general a lot of a
lot more awareness of what you're trying
to do and offers you helpful additions
like oh I can it looks like you might be
trying to refactor that let me let me
help you that I mean let me help you do
that me you know provide a lot of
support for that and I think Swift I'm
really hopeful that an optimistic that
Swift is going to get there because of
the way that the the tooling is is
progressing it seems like it's giving
you more more awareness into what the
code is doing in it using Android studio
gave me a glimpse of what that's like on
a mature set of tools and I think some
of the changes this year with the visual
memory debugger and a bunch of other
editor extensions I think we're much
closer now with Xcode cool can you
summarize for the students just how the
visual memory debugger yeah it's really
cool I haven't gotten to play with it
much but when you're so when arc came
along it got us all to think about our
object hierarchies and our relationship
stuff in memory not in terms of I'm
gonna allocate some stuff and do some
stuff and then later release it but in
terms of an object graph so I have an
object it's holding strong reference to
this other object and the lifecycle of
this is now tied to this and you can do
that on paper you can do that on a
whiteboard but now you can actually see
it in your code so yeah you you pause
your application you click a button it
shows you it takes some object and then
sort of traces back looking at all the
strong and weak references to it and
figures out this model of okay what's
everything that's holding a reference to
this it's like it's what I've always
wanted because in debugging things I'm
often building that model in my head
okay here's this and I look through the
code alright this holds a strong
reference and I like draw it on a piece
of paper and now Xcode can do that for
you it's really cool yeah there's a
bunch of places in our in our courses
where we have our students draw object
graphs so now they can just like or
compare compare the ones they draw with
the ones that it's good yeah and it's a
nice companion to the visual view
debugger as well I think those two are
really nice like here is now a view from
the top down and from the bottom up of
what's going on inside your app yeah so
is it a is it do you think it makes it
easier for for beginners and
intermediate programmers to learn if
they don't have to see those ugly edges
in the beginning yeah or do you think it
sort of makes them soft I think that
each one of those ugly edges is an
opportunity for somebody to lose
interest somebody to get disheartened
and I think sort of suppressing those
and making so that you can really learn
the concepts and really gain confidence
that you can make this machine do cool
stuff before you then have to start
getting into the nitty-gritty and yes
it's a very valuable tool set to be able
to understand the way that this appears
in the code is not necessarily exactly
what's going on into the hood and and
but you don't have to understand all of
that stuff all the way down to the metal
be a good developer like how far down
that stack you go will depend on the
kind of stuff they work on and the kind
of stuff that you enjoy but you know
there's very little of that that you
have to deal with in JavaScript and you
can build web applications in JavaScript
without having to worry about a lot of
that stuff because the abstractions are
there what advice would you give our
students sort of a programmer who's just
starting out and they have so many
different tools to learn how do they
know where to start you know how do they
know what to focus on pick a project
first use the tools that will help you
solve your problem and make your thing
you know pick a game it's fun too if you
don't have some other idea in mind pick
a classic game breakout or snake or
something like that just to get started
pick some problem in your life something
that would be useful to automate
something that you kind of do every day
a scheduler plan our kind of thing if
you're into that or if you're more
visual some sort of digital art thing
draw a smiley face and then Google
around like pick pick some tool whether
it's iOS or processing or scratch or
whatever and then just Google like how
do I do X in this thing and if your
question is too broad then narrow it
down how do I draw a circle in this
thing and just kind of go from there use
the tool in service of solving some
problem even if it's a contrived problem
that you set yourself what would you say
to a student who's having a hard time
choosing between coding and their other
passions I don't think it necessarily
has to be a one or the other choice like
I'm into juggling and I try to
incorporate juggling stuff into
programming I wrote an app that's you
can spin an iPad on your finger and it
will draw pictures which is totally a
juggling nerd thing so cool and I'm also
into like graphics and UI stuff and I of
course bring that to programming so I
think there's there's tons of
opportunities to take whatever your
weird goofy passion is and like do a
deep dive on it and figure out all the
nerdy stuff and the notation of whatever
the weird thing is that you're into and
bring that to programming and use
programming as a way of thinking and a
way of problem-solving to contribute
something there
those are all the questions I have thank
you so much sub enjoy the rest of the
conference
