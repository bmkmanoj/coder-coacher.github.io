variables for each of the primitive
types that we saw earlier so now we have
a couple more variables and I've
explicitly stated the type for each even
though it's really not necessary except
for the case of the float in the double
the character would be the same as well
so I'll leave that one I'm going to
remove all the other ones really quick
but the rest of them I think Swift will
infer just fine and we can double check
so that's an int like we wanted that's a
string and that's a bool now what about
these float and double types they seem
to represent pretty similar values their
floating point numbers but why would you
use one over the other well that comes
down to an issue of precision and being
able to most accurately represent a
floating point number truth be told
computers actually have a pretty
difficult time doing this usually
computers even have special hardware
dedicated just to floating point numbers
typically you'll want to use double
instead of float because it can handle
floating point numbers at a higher
precision but double isn't always better
in cases where speed may be more
important than the accuracy of a
floating point number you may want to
choose float instead next let's try
changing a variables value let's change
my jersey number since we've already
declared my jersey number we can just
change it with this simple syntax here
we have the name of the variable an
equal sign and then the new value that
we want so following this change we can
see that my jersey number went from
being 5 here to 80 here and we can keep
doing this as many times as we'd like
however when we change a variables value
we must ensure that the new value is of
the right type so in this case every
single one of these are integers so the
compiler wouldn't complain but let's try
something a little bit different in this
case we're going to try to change my
jersey number to something that would
typically be inferred as a string and
this is a problem we can see that the
compiler is complaining and it says we
cannot assign a value of type string to
a value of type in because my jersey
number was declared as an integer it
specs an integer
and the reason this is a problem is
because Swift is strongly typed or we
might say that Swift is a strongly typed
language this means that once a
variables type has been declared or set
it cannot change so if we look at where
my jersey number is declared we know
that it's an integer and it can't change
therefore it can't be set to the string
