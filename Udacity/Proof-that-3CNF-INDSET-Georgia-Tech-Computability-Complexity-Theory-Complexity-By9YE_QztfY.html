transformation just describes does in
fact reduce 3-cnf satisfiability
to independent set we start by arguing
that if F is satisfiable then the output
graph G has an independent set of size M
we'll let t be a satisfying assignment
for F in our example let's take the one
that makes a true B false C false and D
false and we'll set the complements
accordingly then we choose one literal
from each clause in our original formula
that is true under the truth assignment
and this will form our set s so in our
example I might choose this a this B bar
and this B bar here clearly the size of
the set is M the number of clauses
because the vertices come from distinct
clauses there can't be any within Clause
edges and because the truth assignment T
doesn't contradict itself there can't be
any contradiction or between Clause
edges either therefore s must be an
independent set and indeed it is in this
example let's prove the other direction
next if G has an independent set of size
M then the formula f is satisfiable
we start with an independent set of size
m in the graph here I've marked an
independent set in our example graph the
fact that there can be no between Clause
edges in s implies that the literals in
s come from distinct clauses and the
fact that there are no between Clause
edges implies that the literals in s are
non contradictory therefore any
assignment consistent with the literals
of F will satisfy the original formula F
here the choice of literals a B and C
implies that a B and C all be true we
can set D however we like true or false
and we still have a satisfying
assignment so that completes the proof
that independent set is as hard as 3-cnf
and that completes this chain here
showing that both independent set and
vertex cover are np-complete
now we're going to branch out both in
the tree here and in the type of
arguments we'll make by considering the
subset sum problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
