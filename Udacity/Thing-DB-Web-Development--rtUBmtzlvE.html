DB and it's still called I think it's
still called T DB in the reddit code so
if you find any code that's called T DB
or t DB - I think this was the second
version of the thing DB that I wrote at
some point this is what it's referring
to instead of having a table that look
like this a link table with a bunch of
different columns on it for different
things we would instead do something
like this we'd have a table that just
had a couple properties on it and a
couple properties that everything had
let me see if I can remember these
things
everything has a score an author and a
date there might be a few other fields
like ups and downs kind of encapsulated
in score but basically everything
whether it's a link whether it's a
comment whether it's a sub reddits
anything has these fixed columns it's
not useful for all of them it was pretty
common enough this was called the thing
table and then we had a separate table
that every data type had called the data
table and the data table basically had
three columns it had the thing ID which
thing are we referring to and it had a
key and a value so for a particular data
type for a link for example link might
be represented like this we'd have an
entry in the thing table it might have a
score of five and of course it has an ID
one an author of zero that was my user
ID a date when it was submitted and then
it may have a data table and may have a
bunch of rows in the data table so would
have one row that would be like thing ID
one equal to R and then another row
being ID one title and so for every
property of a thing that wasn't common
across all of the things we would have a
row in the data table and these are
actually different database tables and
they could be on different machines this
allowed us to add features much quicker
because if we wanted to add a new data
type to links it was just the new link
so start getting that new row we
wouldn't have to go fiddle around with
adding it for all the old links you
could just keep in our code the
difference if a link doesn't have this
property pretend it has a default value
and this was really cool it allows us to
add all sorts of features without having
to get the data types right way in
advance and it also allowed us to add
all these new data types for example
down the road we'd add subreddits so
users can make their own kind of
categories their own reddit's and that's
just a thing and so it made our
development process a lot simpler and
then I wrote this whole layer that would
kind of map our Python objects to these
data tables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
