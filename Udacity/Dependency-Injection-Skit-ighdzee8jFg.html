software so that code like a function
does not have its dependencies
hard-coded into it instead the
information that the function needs is
given to the function when it's called
there are a number of reasons for this
it decreases the coupling between a
function and its dependencies it can
decrease the complexity of that function
and it makes it easy to configure the
function if it needs a new or different
dependency this topic can be a little
convoluted to work through though so
I've got some friends to help me explain
it we got Britney hi Cameron Kagura hi
Walter and Mike hey here's what a
typical day looks like in a dependency
injection world hey what's up Britney
hey Cameron what's going on well I've
got a lot of tires any kind any shape
any size great and where do you sit over
there okay great thanks cool hey hey i
just got in and I've got okay what do
you got for me uh blue bricks okay Oh
what sizes uh one by one I think I have
some I think there's like a two by two
there may have been like a bridge for
bike okay okay you have it all got it uh
where do you sit over there okay awesome
great thank you you're welcome hi hi
reporting for duty okay okay what do you
have how much do you have and where do
you sit red bricks a whole bucket full
of them over by the wall third from the
left okay thank you
ah man another prop for a course
hey Brittany hey what do you mean babe
cuz whatever it is I got it yeah I need
a create a prop for an upcoming course I
can do it but I still need some red
bricks and blue bricks and some tires
for the blockage ok I got it don't worry
I'll be right there okay blueberry
Brooks was Walter tires came ok quick we
need blue bricks Oh Walter Walter Walter
we need red bricks we need oh my god you
need tires yes ok he's got the red
bricks we got wheels right here uh we
got the other bricks right here okay are
we good ok I gotta go back to work so so
that was a fun little skit to make but
dependency injection is an important
architectural software pattern and I
want to make sure you understand what's
happening instead of being in charge of
all of the bricks in the tires myself I
just depended on these outside resources
to be provided to me Brittany the
injector in our real life app knows
where all of the information and
services are whenever an app needs some
service or information it tells the
injector its requirements then the
injector fetches those requirements and
provides them to the calling code then
the code uses those services to
accomplish its task dependency injection
is heavily used in angular will make use
of it ourselves in the next video on
angular services
