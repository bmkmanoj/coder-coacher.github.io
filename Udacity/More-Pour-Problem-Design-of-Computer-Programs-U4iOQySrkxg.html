the glass pouring example where we had
two glasses and we could pour it between
them and we're going to do the same
thing here except we're going to allow
an arbitrary number of glasses and so
for example here I've drawn four of them
let's say their capacities or one two
four and eight and let's say we set
ourselves the goal of having five in one
of the glasses how could we achieve that
well here's one solution is we could
fill up this glass with eight that would
be the first action then we could empty
out or pour 1 into here now we'd be down
one and be at that level then the second
action would be to pour it into here now
we'd be down two more and we find we're
at five here so that would solve the
problem an alternative solution would be
to fill this these two glasses with four
and one and then pour both of them into
eight to achieve five so your task will
be to define more poor problem which
takes a tuple of capacities of glasses
any number of glasses and then a goal
which is a single integer that you're
trying to achieve alternately you can
have a start state of what's the current
level of the glasses are if the start
state is none that means zero for all of
the glasses your task is to return a
path which achieves the goal or return
the empty path or their failure if there
is none and the path like before are an
alternation between states and actions
where the states is just a tuple of
current levels not of capacities but of
current levels and then the actions can
be either fill empty or poor and we're
going to describe the glasses by their
index numbers so in this list of
capacities the first number in the list
will call that glass number 0 the next
one glass number 1 and so on so when we
filled up the tallest glass that was
the last glass out of four glass number
three so the action would have been fill
three and here we have a test that says
the problem I just solve for you by
drawing it out the actions are Phil
glass number three poor glass number
three into glass number zero then poor
glass number three in the glass number
one and then you're left with five in
glass number three and here are some
more test cases to to check things out
for you see if you can solve those by
writing your program use what we have
seen before you'll probably want to use
one of the search procedures we've
already defined and you'll probably need
to write custom successor function which
understands the current state and the
capacities and let me just say you know
I've seen some discussion in the forums
about oh can I find a one-line solution
or a two-line solution don't worry about
that the solution will be whatever it is
the sort of setup solve the problem
should be a call to function we've
already defined so that will be one line
but the successor function you know that
might be a dozen lines maybe a little
bit more or a little bit less don't
worry about minimizing it make worry
about making it clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
