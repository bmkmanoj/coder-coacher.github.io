intro quizzes just to get you thinking a
bit about approximation so it's clear
when the stakes are low yes approximate
solutions are acceptable if we gain
running time why not if the
approximation is very good then usually
those solutions are also acceptable the
important thing that I wanted to
emphasize is that in this case here I
said that we have a provable guarantee
on how good the algorithm is so we will
not get into plus minus one percent
unfortunately in this unit but what we
will be doing is we will be analyzing
approximation algorithms to see how good
they really are because the thing is
this approximation algorithms where you
have not done the analysis and they just
sound good can actually lead to very
very bad solutions and i will show you
one example for vertex cover in this
unit so using approximation is okay but
you have to do the analysis nevertheless
to see how good that approximation will
be otherwise you can walk into some
rather nasty traps I would say and
finally whenever an exact solution
cannot be obtained yeah of course then
we have to try an approximation if the
problem is important to us the important
thing here that I would like you to keep
in mind is what we found out in the last
unit that often it is possible to find
exact solutions for NP complete problems
in practice so many people tend to start
out with approximation algorithms once
they hear that a problem is np-complete
and actually I would like you to think
about this the other way around so first
of all NP completeness can definitely
mean that there still is a possibility
for finding exact solutions and only
when that approach fails or you're under
time pressure or there's no really good
known search tree for your problem and
you have to solve it nevertheless only
then would i like you to think about
approximation so I guess my message is
this whenever you encounter an
np-complete problem be demanding an
exact solution unless you really know
it's not possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
