introduced in the late 1950s and early
1960s they both increased levels of
norepinephrine and serotonin the mao
inhibitors work by increasing the
availability of serotonin norepinephrine
and dopamine however the use of mao s is
limited due to the side-effects and
toxicity that is users must avoid
certain foods and drugs to prevent
serious side-effects
one such side-effect is a
life-threatening increase in blood
pressure the tricyclics were discovered
when researchers were working to create
a better phenothiazine antipsychotic and
found a drug that improved mood although
not effective for all patients they do
reduce the severity and duration of the
depressive episodes the tricyclics
include the drug imipramine and that
drug was discovered accidentally some of
the tricyclics are also used in the
management of chronic pain for
bedwetting and for the treatment of ADHD
as we saw in the discussion on drugs in
our consciousness lesson drugs can
produce side effects and the side
effects for the tricyclics include dry
mouth irritability weight gain confusion
and constipation please read the
document we posted in the instructors
notes box because you're going to need
to know this information for the rest of
