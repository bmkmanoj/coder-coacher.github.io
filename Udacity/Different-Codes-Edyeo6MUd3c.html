detail about these types of codes so
this was our tall open shutter the sinc
function looked like this I captured
both low and high frequencies of course
we can just alternate the shutter not in
a random matter at all but just much
more in a timed manner like this
our sinc function also still has low
frequencies and high frequencies just
has a different you know representation
doesn't help us much random we can just
run it randomly and that would allow us
to do this but I can would have more
variations would have more peaks and
lows and stuff like that what these
authors found is some sort of a flutter
starter signal like this which went
through small sharp small large small
large kinds of things gave a sinc
function like this to capture all of the
high frequencies and that was much more
amenable to the kind of stuff they
wanted to do again the analysis of this
exists in the paper and I encourage you
to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
