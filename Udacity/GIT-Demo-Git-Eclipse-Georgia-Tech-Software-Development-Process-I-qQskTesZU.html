functionalities in practice let's go
step further if you remember I mentioned
before that many of these version
control systems are actually integrated
into ideas so what we're going to look
at next is what happens if we put
together get and the clips and the
result is egit where egit is a plugin
for the Eclipse IDE that adds good
functionality to Eclipse so let's see
how that works in practice so support
for git is available in many ideas
including Eclipse and if you want to get
a guitar for a Eclipse you should go to
eclipse github.com and you can download
the plug-in so this brings us to the
plugin page and you can use the provided
URL and directions to install the
plug-in in this case we're gonna copy
this address so we're gonna go to
eclipse help install new software we can
click on add to add a new site from
which to get software we paste the
location that we just copied here and we
can give it a descriptive name in this
case I'll just call it Eclipse get
plugin then when I click OK eclipse will
go and look for plugins and as you can
see there are two options we can select
both of them and click on next
you can see that Eclipse identified a
few dependencies you can click Next and
accept them you can accept the terms and
conditions for the plug-in and then just
finish and at this point
Ackley's will install the plug-in which
might take a little bit of time so we're
just gonna speed it up and when eclipse
is done you will get this prompt they'll
tell you that you need to restart
Eclipse for the plug-in to be actually
installed and at this point you want to
click yes and when eclipse restarts
you'll have your plug-in we're gonna go
to the git repository perspective that
we can select here and when we click OK
you can see that our display will change
and since we don't have any repository
yet we're provided with the possibility
of adding an existing local git
repository cloning a git repository or
creating a new local git repository
we're gonna add an existing local
repository this is the one that we
created earlier so we'll select it and
click finish and you can see that my
project is now added to the set of git
repositories now let's check out the
project from the repository by selecting
import projects and here you can import
something as an existing project you can
use a new project wizard
in this case I chose the option of
importing as a general project then I
click Next and as you can see I have the
project name up there and I can click
finish so now if I go to the resource
perspective by clicking here I can see
that the project has been added to my
set of projects and I can see all the
files within the project particularly if
I click on the readme you can see that
we have the readme file that we created
before same thing for the test file so
one thing I can do at this point is to
execute different git commands perform
different get operations by using the
team submenu in the contextual menu and
here there's a several things I can do
including some advanced commands and
just to give it a shot I'm gonna try to
click show local history and this shows
the history of the file for example
shows the author and he shows when he
was created when he was authored so now
let's make some changes to this file by
adding some new content i saved the file
and now I can see that arrow that
indicates that my file was locally
changed so now if I go to the team menu
you can see that I have the option to
add to the index to stage the file and
now I got there's a new label that start
that shows the file is added to the
index and now at this point I can go to
the team menu again and I can actually
commit the file by selecting the
corresponding entry this allows me to
enter the commit message is that in the
same way which I could do that from the
command line with the textual editor and
after I put the comment there I can
actually commit and now if we look at
the history view we can see here that we
have a new version for the file that we
just modified and we can also see the
commit comment and at this point if we
had a remote repository we could push
our changes to that remote repository as
well again using the team submenu in the
contextual menu and speaking of remote
repositories what we're going to see
next is how to use github repositories
which are remote repositories that are
hosted on github</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
