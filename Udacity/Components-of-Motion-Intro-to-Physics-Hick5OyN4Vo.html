moving down to the right and just think
if we were throwing a real ball off the
tower its path would look something like
this so at any instant we can
approximate the direction it's moving by
a straight line like this and yeah sure
enough it goes down to the right
remember whenever you asked a
qualitative question like this one in
physics
well physics describes reality you
should never provide an answer that
disagrees with what you think would
actually happen okay so how do we get
this answer
well these blue arrows are what we call
components of the balls velocity we've
already mentioned the horizontal
component and this one we'll call the
vertical component those two together
create the balls resulting velocity but
they have to be added appropriately the
way we do that is we imagine sliding
this horizontal vector down so its tail
matches with this guy's tip and we can
also slide this vertical one over here
so now we've created this nice
rectangular shape where those meat we
draw our line and we have our resulting
velocity this is going to come in handy
when we want to do some trigonometry
later and just to give you a hint you
can already see the right triangles
forming now this has all been talked
about in a very abstract sort of way
let's actually solve a problem so we
know what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
