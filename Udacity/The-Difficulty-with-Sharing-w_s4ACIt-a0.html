enough I need to do something about
privacy and shopping list sharing right
now when you click on the my list screen
you see every single shopping list and
while it does show you who owns each
list it still shows you all of the lists
that were created even from strangers
that you frankly don't care about
instead of this big a free-for-all I
think the best idea would be to
implement some sort of sharing here let
me show you what I've gotten my plan is
that when you make a list only you can
see and access that list so if i have my
generic grocery list here and i just
made it only i could actually see this
but what i'll do is i'll add a little
share button up here clicking sure opens
up a list of your friends out of the
hundreds or thousands of users or
hopefully hundreds of thousands users
that they'll someday be you probably
have a smaller circle of friends that
you actually want to share shopping
lists with so will store the data of who
you say that you often share shopping
lists with and then you could add
additional friends by clicking this
button down here and this would take you
to the add friend activity and this
activity here would have a list of all
users of the app so you can scroll
through the users and find one that you
want to be your friend say kagura press
her name and that would add her to the
list of your friends then with any of
these friends you can click the little
plus icon here and that would turn the
sharing on so if this is Walter screens
and he just clicked this then he'd be
sharing with me then when i open my
version of the app I'd be able to see
the new list that Walter just shared
with me that sounds good Lila so I have
another idea to add here what if we
design the data structure like this let
me show you my screen here you've got
your list of users and in each user is a
list of push IDs for the shopping list
they own and are shared on we could set
them to some dummy value like true huh
JP so that does sound interesting but
I'm already seeing one problem the issue
is how do you use the firebase list
adapter with this kind of data the
firebase list adapter will be passed a
location so I could pass them this user
list location that has all these
children and then I'll try to display
all these children so I could display a
list of these push IDs pretty easily but
ultimately I'm going to try to be using
that populate view method to make a list
item that looks like this but I can't
get this data here and once I make some
additional listeners and it just sounds
like a lot of overhead yeah that's rough
you could duplicate some of the data or
possibly use some fire
is building filtering capabilities to
only grab the list you have access to
I'll look into those but honestly right
now I'm beat I'll check in tomorrow
morning you should get some rest yeah
you know I've got some coffee so I'll
think about it a little bit more it's
just so important to get the data right
I don't think I should work on anything
else until the developer and I have a
plan if only there was some way to know
how users would use the app and what
kind of performance constraints you need
to deal with mmhmm yeah well it's not
like we can see into the future we're
certainly Kara all right good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
