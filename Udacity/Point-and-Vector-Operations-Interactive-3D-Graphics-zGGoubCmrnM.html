describes a motion we can combine points
and vectors in various useful ways by
adding or subtracting their coordinates
from one another to start with if you
subtract the location to point a from
point B you get a vector describing how
to get from point A to B so B minus a is
calculated by taking the coordinates and
subtracting them from one another and
this gives you vector V the reverse also
holds true a plus V equals B while we
can subtract points to get an effector
our system doesn't produce anything
geometrically meaningful if you add the
two points together we can also add and
subtract vectors themselves for example
S Plus T equals u we can also reverse
this process for example u minus T
equals s and we can go the other way
around
for example u minus s equals T one way
to think about vector subtraction is
that you're instead adding a vector
going the opposite direction as shown
here the other thing Comley done with
vectors and points is to multiply them
by a scalar that is a number multiplying
a vector by a scalar is clear enough you
want to describe moving further in a
given direction if you multiply by
negative one you reverse the vectors
direction multiplied by a different
negative number and you reverse the
direction and change how far to move
multiplying a point by a number is a way
to make an object larger or smaller this
type of operation called scaling we'll
discuss in detail later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
