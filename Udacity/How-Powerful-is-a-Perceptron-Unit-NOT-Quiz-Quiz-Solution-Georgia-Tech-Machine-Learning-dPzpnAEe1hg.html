how we can do this I think the answer is
simply that we basically need to flip
the here's my thinking we need to flip 0
and one would suggest that either our
weight or our threshold needs to be
negative and since we the threshold
isn't above it's gonna end up being our
weight being negative so let's see if we
have a zero we want to turn that into
something above the threshold and if
it's a 1 we want it to be below the
threshold so why don't we make the
weight negative 1 okay and and that will
turn a zero into a zero and I'll turn a
1 into a minus 1 all right and so then
the threshold just has to be zero so
that would mean that anything I see so
anything that's negative will be greater
than or 0 zero or negative will be
greater than equal to the threshold and
anything on the other side of that would
be under the threshold so we get this
kind of dividing line at 1 so we're
taking advantage of the fact that the
equation had a greater than or equal to
in it so yeah right that ought to be a
knot so we've got and or and not are all
expressible as perceptron units so so
and or not are all expressible as
perceptron units hey that's great
because if we have and or and not then
we can represent any boolean function
well do we know that we know that if we
combined them together we combine these
perceptron units together can we can we
express any perceptron or sorry any
boolean function that we want using a
single perceptron so what do we normally
do in this case so what's the most evil
function we can think of yes indeed well
when we were working on on decision
trees the thing that was so evil was the
X or the or parity more generally so all
right I mean maybe if we can do that we
can do anything so let's let's give it a
shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
