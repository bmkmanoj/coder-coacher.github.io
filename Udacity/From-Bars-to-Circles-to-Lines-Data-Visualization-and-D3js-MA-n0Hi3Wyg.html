here that the bars have been converted
into circles and the axes remain the
same in this case years with the label
every four years and the y-axis
represents attendance in millions and
with our scatterplot if we hover we
still have the interactive features but
this time there's both the horizontal
and the vertical guideline that animate
out my ideal choice of chart type in
this case is a line plot since the
x-axis represents time and as a natural
sequence to it for any time series data
a point at time T on the x-axis somewhat
depends on the time that just came
before in this example 1948 somewhat
depends on 1947 which depends on 1946
and this natural ordering from one year
to the next or from one data point to
the next represent something of a
transition and the line plot really
evokes this interpretation by linking
each data point from one to the next
with the graphical element in this case
a line or path between the two if we go
back to our editor remember we can
change what type of plot we're making or
chart by simply changing what we pass to
add series in this case let's change
scatter to line save our file and go
back to a browser if we refresh the page
we can see here every dot has
disappeared and instead we have a line
representing the trend but one slight
formatting quirk of this line plot that
we no longer know how many data points
we actually have especially if dimple
didn't provide us with hover interaction
we wouldn't really know which years and
how much attendance in those years is
represented in our data and without the
hover interaction it would actually be
impossible to know that a World Cup
didn't happen in year 1942 in the year
nineteen forty six quick fix for this is
to actually combine a line plot and your
scatter plot to get the best of both
charts and almost none of the downsides
in dimple again being the flexible and
powerful library that it is to achieve
this effect we simply just need to add
another series in this case both the
line and our scatter and to draw them on
the same set of x and y axes going back
to the browser now we have both the line
showing the trend over the years and the
circles to show us which year's games
actually happened in and what the
precise attendance was for those years
and with our scatter dots we can now see
that there were no games between
nineteen thirty eight and nineteen fifty
or rather that the nineteen forty-two
and nineteen forty six games were
skipped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
