festivals so here we see that Johnny
concert it's going to cloudstock which
is very cool so in theory if I click
this I should be able to see everyone
who's going you should see Johnny and
Missy alright cool
I think I'm really starting to get to
know Johnny and Missy okay and it's not
a field it's this other so fields are up
here festival name and all that but this
is something different and it's just a
list of all these attendees so that's
what came up at the final step of the
field creation wizard that was adding
this related list which is just a list
of related records onto the page layout
for the festival okay okay so great we
have our two attendees who bought some
number of tickets I assume but it's
still I mean of course it still says
ticket sold is zero there's no way it
would have known ideally I don't you
know I don't like that
what can we well there is a way that it
would have known and so it's really
great that we can create some automated
calculated fields in Salesforce so we've
kind of brushed upon the different data
types but we haven't talked about
roll-up summaries or formula fields and
so with the roll-up summary you're able
to summarize information about related
records and so let's create a rollup
summary based off of the attendees to
show how many tickets have been sold in
total at the concert and can we do that
I'd actually I don't like how we did
this I would rather keep track of the
VIP tickets sold and the general
admission ticket sold separately can we
do that we can we can just create a
filter on the summary so super easy so
again let's just go to the quick access
menu and create a new field okay I've
got a new field and you said roll-up
summary but it is grayed out Sam so this
comes back to me just skipping through
choosing lookup / master detail you can
only create a roll-up summary when the
relationship is through a master detail
relationship and since we created a
lookup we're not able to do roll-up
summaries but thankfully we can change
it now that we've related all of our
attendees to a festival into a master
detail relationship so let's go back
really quickly to the attendee fields
and we can just change that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
