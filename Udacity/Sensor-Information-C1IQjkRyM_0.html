down the hall it's got this noisy sensor
this is perfect for sort of a
probabilistic bayesian filter based
tracker and the reason is first of all
it's going to have some continuous
belief about where it thinks it might be
all right so that's its belief its
distribution its posterior about where
things and its measurements are noisy
and furthermore it's really unlikely
that the penny Palmer's measurements
that it will have a nice Gaussian belief
about where things are its belief is
going to be whatever it is so we're
going to make use of a particle filter
to do this all right what you're seeing
here is this is the prior density so
here's our little rich we named our
robot sure what's a goodnight see i
would use some like r2d2 kind of name
but then i would get sued by George
Lucas so we'll call it our 3d three okay
so our 3d three is sitting over here and
this here this is his prior belief about
where it is right now we have no idea
how it got that value this is its random
distribution you can see it's a pretty
uniform distribution of particles now
the sensor reaches out and it gets a
measurement and let's just suppose it
sticks its thick out and it sees a hole
what that means is the stick doesn't run
into anything so it says oh it's a hole
now using the sensor model the Brobot
has to evaluate not where it thinks it
is but first what's the probability that
I would see a hole if I was at each of
these locations so after the robot sees
the whole what it has to evaluate is
what is the likelihood that I we've seen
a hole if I was at this location so
these values here these are not the
probability that I'm at that location
given that I saw a hole it's the
probability that I would see a whole
given that i was at that location so the
reason that its highest in the middle is
because even if I've got a wiggly stick
over here the likelihood that i see a
hole is higher than if I'm sort of at
the edge of the hole right because then
i might sometimes run into the wall
sometimes run into the hole and that's
why I have this
nice tight little distribution like that
okay so remember that's not p of x given
the whole it's probably that i would see
a whole given that i was an X then what
do we do well in our particle filter we
just multiply P of Z given X probability
the whole given x times my prior
distribution for every one of these X's
okay so that's what this distribution is
down here that is the multiplication of
the prior times the likelihood and in
math remember the belief is proportional
to the prediction or my belief prior
that's this here x my likelihood that's
this value here and then I have to
normalize the whole thing in order to
get a new belief okay that's why I'm
doing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
