we're not here to teach you how to build
a weather app it's not even to teach you
all of the Android API is that we use to
build it it's really about retraining
your brain to start thinking like a
mobile developer which is really
important because at the end of this
course we're going to ask you to build
your own final project we're expecting
you to already be familiar with
object-oriented programming and to have
experience with Java or a similar
language personally I got started with
Android after years of Delfy and c-sharp
development as engineers were trained to
map our experiences in one language or
SDK into new ones looking for patterns
and shortcuts we can get up to speed as
quickly as possible but mobile and
Android in particular has some
fundamental differences that mean some
of our experience and intuition will
actually make us worse mobile engineers
we like to think of smartphones as
computers that fit into our pockets in a
way that's true but their computers from
the 90s like this powerhouse I was using
nearly 20 years ago with limited
internet connectivity
low-speed CPUs and limited RAM on top of
which they're all running on batteries
as we go through the course I'll be
returning to each of these key mobile
challenges looking for places where your
experience on desktop or server or even
other mobile platforms might lead you in
the wrong direction
I'll also be back to tell you some
stories from the early days of Android
stories that describe how the Android
platform has evolved and nowhere is that
more readily apparent than here at the
Android lawn sculpture garden join me
here at the very heart of Android at the
end of this lesson to find out how this
sculpture garden of tasty treats also
tells the story of androids history for
now let's get back to building that
weather app so we'll cross to dad to
take a look at some mocks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
