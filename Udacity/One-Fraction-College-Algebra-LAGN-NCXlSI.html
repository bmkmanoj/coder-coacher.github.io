over 2a from both sides then both of our
fractions on the right-hand side have a
denominator of 2a so it's really easy to
combine them this gives us finally a
final answer of x equals negative B plus
or minus the square root of b squared
minus 4ac all over 2a ha you can have a
giant sigh of relief now that was a lot
of work and involves some pretty
complicated algebra I think that in
doing this you had to use almost all the
skills you've learned in this course so
far so this is super impressive I am so
proud of you so what does this mean
again remember we started out with an
equation in this form a quadratic
equation ax squared plus bx plus c
equals 0 working from that we've solved
for x which means that now we have a
formula where if we know the
coefficients of a quadratic equation
written in this form we can find the
values of x that satisfy it in other
words for any parabola we have if we can
write its equation in standard form ax
squared plus BX plus C equals y then we
can set y equal to 0 and find the
x-intercepts this is huge this is
incredibly powerful and we did all of
this by just completing the square and
of course doing some other algebraic
manipulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
