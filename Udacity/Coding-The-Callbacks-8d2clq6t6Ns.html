app it's time to take a moment to talk
about what's actually happening in the
final app if you remember we have the
map on the screen which is somehow
modified by pressing the buttons at the
top now thus far we've learned how to
make a map fragment and change that
through user activity but we haven't
learned how to create a Google map
object which is the thing that within
cold we'll be able to change the
contents of the map fragment so to do
this there's a few things that we need
first of all we'll need to implement the
on map ready callback
now we'll do that by modifying the class
declaration for a main activity to have
this so here I have my own map ready
which is just setting map ready a
boolean to true and then this local
variable called M map to map and you
notice here it passes back a Google map
so my M map of course is a local
instance of a Google map and you can see
I've defined it at the top of my
activity here and of course the activity
itself has to implement the on map ready
callback so within our own map ready I'm
just saying the map ready is true I'm
loading my local instance of a map with
the one that was sent back to me I
create a new lat/long which I'm calling
New York with the latitude and longitude
coordinates we used earlier on then I'm
setting the camera position using a
camera position builder I'm targeting at
New York and I'm setting the zoom to 14
so we'll be a little bit further out
than the one we saw earlier and then on
M map itself now the map object I can
call the move camera on that to set its
position to be this target as you can
see it's pretty straightforward and you
can do other things like angling and
zooming to different levels and
different types of views that you want
on the camera position itself but here
I've created a very basic camera
position so that's all that you really
need to do to get your map set up for
working within an application and having
a handle on a map object that you can
then program and I'll show you in the
next step how we then program that to
allow to have satellite or hybrid views</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
