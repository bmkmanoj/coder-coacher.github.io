no I'm sorry that's wrong no no I think
that well if it's right then we need to
provide a sequence that proves it okay
so what are you thinking well I was
thinking actually something very similar
what we just saw okay we're so tit for
tat what they're going to do is they're
going to do cooperate cooperate
cooperate cooperate right that's what
they normally want to do exactly so what
would happen if at one point one of them
defected okay just for simplicity let's
make it the very first point mm-hmm so
tit for tat number one defect and tip
for tet number two also defects at the
very first time know that cooperates
because it's done at the same time well
I mean so we can feed it anything we
want so we could tell tit for tat two to
cooperate so sort of like we've taken
over its brain for a brief amount of
time so I'm not yet convinced it's going
to matter for this but the thing is that
from that point on tit for tat two is
going to want to for the next step to
for tattoo is going to want to defect
that's right and tit for tat one would
want to cooperate uh-huh and that sort
of sucks tit for tat to write so I don't
know so maybe we should try to think
through what is the expected reward for
tit for tat to to actually do this
defect at this time um or wait no so so
sorry to stick with the tit for tat
machine at this time well what's going
to happen at that point is it's going to
keep alternating that's exactly right so
it's going to get the rewards
corresponding to D versus CC vs DD vs CC
vs d over and over again yeah so let's
think think about in the average reward
case so in the D vs see if it does d
when the other machine does see that it
gets 0 mm-hmm if it does see when the
other one does D it gets minus 9 and
then this alternates so if we look at
the average reward which is basically
what you get when the discount factor is
very very high it's scoring negative 4.5
right is there any way that it could
behave against tit for tat starting from
this point that would do better than
negative 4.5 just go ahead and cooperate
just cooperate forever well cooperate
the next time and then keep doing kid
for tat from that point
it'll work out to be cooperate forever
on average that's right which will get
us a minus minus 1 so not being tit for
tat at that point but instead of two
instead turning to always cooperate
would actually get it better so the idea
that it should defect at this point is
an implausible threat exactly so this is
not sub game perfect so yes you nailed
it yay does that make sense it doesn't
make sense good alright so that leaves
open the question of is there a way to
be sub game perfect in prisoner's
dilemma can ask you a question sure
before you answer that so I had sort of
convinced myself that it didn't matter
whether tit for tat number two started
out with C or started out with d I'm
trying to decide whether that's actually
true okay that's a good question so what
will happen at this from this point on
if we now continue you know we took over
the brains of tit-for-tat and we force
them to play defect against effect and
now we release that and we let them do
what whatever it is that they're going
to do and what is that what are they
going to do is live forever yeah and is
there anything that tit for tat to
machine could do to get a better score
than that cooperating yeah so it could
cooperating with tit for tat will bring
it back into mutual cooperation it will
actually get a better score yeah so in
one case it would average 2-1 and the
other one at week eight it would average
2-3 and minus one is better so you're
right good point so really what matters
is that we get we get them defecting
right look it's that make sense so I was
right that it didn't matter although you
do get slightly different answers we're
slightly different averages that's right
but in both cases there's a way of
getting a higher average right ok cool
that's what I thought I thought it was
something like that so now let's go back
to what you wanted to do so are we going
to be able to figure out how to do
prisoner's dilemma no way that is sub
game perfect well how about I propose a
machine and we'll see what it does ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
