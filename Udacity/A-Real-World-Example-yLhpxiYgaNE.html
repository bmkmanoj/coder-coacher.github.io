attacks that occurred towards the end of
2013 was the Target store breach okay so
in this case you would want to ask this
question what is of value that somebody
was after and if somebody was after who
was that what is the threat source then
we can say well what one reberty did
they exploit so the target case
essentially what they were after was
credit card data that is there on the
point-of-sale systems that are in Target
stores the people who are after it are
cyber criminals because they want to
profit from this stolen information and
the world liberty they exploited it's an
interesting one so target doors had an
HVAC contractor the hack actually began
with a phishing message to an employee
of that HVAC company through that
phishing attacks they were able to get
credentials that gave the either
criminals access to targets network and
once they were on targets networks then
they were able to get to the point of
sale systems where they installed
malware to siphon off the credit card
numbers so this is a real-world example
with a security mindset essentially we
are saying where is the threat come from
cyber criminals what are the after
credit card data what one er ability was
that in the system that got exploited
well we just talked about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
