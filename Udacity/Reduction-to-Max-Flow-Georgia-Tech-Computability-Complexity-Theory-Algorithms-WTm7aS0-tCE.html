bipartite graph and the notion of a
matching now we're going to see the
connection with maximum flow intuitively
a maximum matching problem should feel
like we're trying to push as much stuff
from one side of the partition to the
other it should be no surprise then that
there turns out to be an easy reduction
to the maximum flow problem which we've
already studied we build a flow network
that has the same set of vertices plus
two more which serve as the source and
the sink we then add edges from the
source to one half the partition and
from the other half the partition to the
sink internal edges are given a
direction from the source side to the
sink side all capacities are set to one
setting the capacities of the new edges
to one is important to ensure that flow
from or to any vertex isn't more than
one we only want to match each of these
vertices once having constructed the
graph we run ford-fulkerson on it and we
return the edges with positive flows as
the matching actually all edges will
have flow 0 or 1 as we'll see the time
analysis here is rather simple building
the network is order e or maybe order V
depending on the representation used in
any case this is small however compared
to the cost of running ford-fulkerson
which is e times V note that V is a
bound on the total capacity of the flow
and hence a bound on the total number of
iterations in this particular case this
bound gives a better one then we would
obtain data by the scaling algorithm or
by edmonds-karp lastly of course we have
the step of simply returning the edges
with positive flows and that's just a
matter of writing the answer out so
that's order V clearly ford-fulkerson is
the dominant part and we end up with an
algorithm that is order e times V</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
