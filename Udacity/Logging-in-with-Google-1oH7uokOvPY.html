the server-side firebase and Google
stuff set up so let's go back to our
Android app and talk about what we need
to do to get that ready for Google logon
the big picture goal is to get an OAuth
token from google and then hand that
token over to firebase and this is all
going to have an android app side once
you've gotten your OAuth token the
process is very similar to logging in
with email and password you call off
with OAuth token then firebase uses the
OAuth token to get data from Google
after which firebase creates for you
that handy JWT and of course you're off
data object and then finally you get
your off and add about objects so that
you can update your android UI now
getting an OAuth token from google
requires a fair amount of boilerplate
code and I flicked a Google
authentication example so you can take a
look through it but let's take a quick
look at what's going on in our app okay
so I'm in the login activity class and
if you scroll down you'll see that here
pre faced by this large comment is all
of the boilerplate code that I took to
get the token so really all this code is
just to get that OAuth token and it's
nothing too special but you can read
through it now I've left the interesting
part of connecting the OAuth token to
firebase for you to do now there are a
few more things that you need to do with
Google which are outlined in the
firebase and Google authentication to be
able to get that token these include
adding some libraries to Gradle
generating a config file and adding
permissions to the manifest I'll provide
you with the links in the spec document
with how to set all of that up once
you've got the auth token signing into
google is almost exactly the same as
signing in with email and password
instead of an email and password though
you provide the provider name which in
this case is Google and that special Oh
auth token the result handler works
exactly the same though if the user is
logged into google and gives shopping
list plus plus all the correct
permissions then all nothin to cater
will be called and you'll have that
handy dandy off data parameter you
should do the same thing with a user who
logs in via Google as a user who logs in
with email and password your app should
send them to the main activity and not
take them back to the login page if they
click the back button okay let me send
you this back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
