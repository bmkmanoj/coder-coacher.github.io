these course developers and welcome to
coffee break we just launched a class
called introduction to Salesforce app
development in this class
you learned how to build web and mobile
apps on your phone and it takes six
seven maybe eight hours of work you
don't have to write any code and at the
end you are actually building really
amazing apps this last week we were at
Dreamforce which is Salesforce's
big annual tech conference and when we
were there we talked to some employers
and some developers about how much they
liked building on this platform and what
the job opportunities there are my name
is Jerry you and I work at Wells Fargo
Advisors been there two years and I'm a
salesforce.com developer and
administrator so I started like I said
two years ago but I had a finance and
marketing background coming in and I
realized that our company wasn't
leveraging salesforce.com to its fullest
especially in terms of automation and
custom user interfaces so I decided that
I could fill that gap and taught myself
by going online watching videos
attending workshops reading and I think
anybody really can do it you just have
to know how to have the patience to sit
down and think through problems logic is
obviously a good plus to have and to be
able to not get too frustrated because I
know it can be really really a big pain
if you don't get it at first so you just
have to you know get through those
obstacles and it'll be really cool once
you know yeah Udacity we were one of
them yeah so cool thank you so I hope
you enjoyed that and I hope you enroll
in introduction to Salesforce app
development even if you've never heard
of Salesforce before I promise you this
class is actually a really great way to
get introduced to some of the concepts
that computer scientists developers of
all sorts are working with all the time
hope to see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
