we've seen examples like this before you
might have thought that a statement has
to end in a semicolon but if we scroll
back to our grammar a bit we see no
statement can be identified equals
expression and those semicolons come in
when we have multiple statements like in
a compound statement block similarly x
equals 3/2 any expression can go on the
right-hand side of the equal side and we
saw that our grammar for expressions
earlier included binary operators like
division so this totally works this
series of tokens if X is less than five
then open curly brace x equals x plus
one curly brace looks very convincing
it's almost right but it's missing a
semicolon and inside these compound
blocks we really need those so this one
doesn't work the one right below it has
that semicolon so it can be derived from
stmt in our grammar over here inside our
compound statement we have two smaller
statements X is X plus 1 and Y is 3 each
one of which is an individual statement
in each one of which is terminated by a
semicolon that's the rule we established
earlier finally over here we have an if
then else statement this was a little
tricky in Python conceptually this might
work out but in JavaScript we explicitly
need the else token so this one's not
driveable from statement even though the
rest of it is well formed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
