solution here first we initialize this
variable M which we say is equal to
length of values so we're basically
saying here hey this is how many data
points we have
we also initialize this variable called
cost history which is going to track how
our cost function evolves over our
iterations we say for I in range num
iterations which basically says hey
we're going to update theta in the cost
a number of times equal to the number of
iterations let's calculate the predicted
values we'll do that by taking the dot
product of the features and theta then
we're going to update our values of
theta this looks pretty complicated but
you'll note that it's the same as the
equation that we just discussed which
will pull up again here so we subtract
our observed values from our predicted
values take the dot product of this
vector with the features and then
essentially multiply by this alpha over
m feature and subtract that from theta
this is effectively gradient descent in
action so we're taking a very small step
in the direction of the steepest
gradient then we're going to use a
another function called compute cost
which we see up here so you compute the
cost function given our features our
values and our theta then we'll append
the newest cost for the cost history
list and once we've done this a number
of times equal to the number of
iterations will not only return our
final set of Thetas but also the entire
cost history you'll see that if we run
this function we get this array which
are our theta values about 45 minus 9
and 13 and these values kind of indicate
how significant each factor is in
determining our predicted values so this
45 corresponds to a constant term the
minus 9 corresponds to height and the 13
and change corresponds to the weight and
then we see here how the cost function
has evolved over time ideally if we had
a perfect model this cost function would
approach 0 you'll see that our cost
function doesn't you know it close to 0
it does decrease a good amount as we
trained this model but it doesn't do
super well and so this might lead you
logically to a natural question which is
hey you know not all models are created
equal maybe our model is actually bad is
there some way that we can evaluate our
models why don't we discuss this a
little bit more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
