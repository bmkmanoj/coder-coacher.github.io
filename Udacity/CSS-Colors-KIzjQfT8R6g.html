CSS however in order to do this you
first need to understand how color is
encoded to start color is composed of
light all light including the light
being emitted from your screen right now
is composed of a certain proportion of
red green and blue light the amount of
red green and blue light is what
determines the color you see for example
the combination of red and green light
with the absence of blue light is what
makes the color yellow
the combination of green and blue light
with the absence of red light is what
makes the color cyan and there are
countless variations in between the
different combinations of red green and
blue light makeup 16,777,216 colors
that's a lot of colors when writing CSS
you express color by specifying the
amount of red green and blue light that
should be present this can be done in
one of two ways
in the first way which is commonly
referred to as RGB each amount of red
green and blue light is written as a
decimal number between 0 and 255 0 being
the lowest value or no presence of light
and 255 being the highest value or a
hundred-percent presence of the light
for example if I wanted to change the
background color of this page to magenta
then I'd write background color RGB 255
0 255 the first 255 specifies red light
the zero specifies green light and the
second 255 specifies blue light the
combination of these values produces
magenta in the second way which is
called hexadecimal or hex for short each
amount of red green and blue light is
written as a hexadecimal number between
the values 0 0 and FF 0 0 which is just
0 in decimal in FF which is just 255 in
decimal if you're unfamiliar with how
hexadecimal works check below for some
helpful links using the same example for
magenta I would instead write background
color and pound sign this tells the
browser I'm using hex code and then FF 0
0 FF
the first FF which is really just 255 in
decimal specifies red light zero zero
which is just zero in decimal specifies
green light and the second FF which
again is 255 in decimal specifies the
blue light this encoding also produces
the color magenta now colors aren't
always as straightforward as primary and
secondary colors like I said there are
millions of different colors you can
express using CSS often what can be
helpful is using a color picker to get
the exact shade tint and tone for the
color you're trying to use you've
probably seen a color picker before if
you've ever used a graphics or design
tool but did you know that most browsers
actually come with their own built-in
color picker check it out
here I have Google Chrome opened and I'm
looking at BBC's website if I inspect
the navigation bar and try changing the
background color you can see that by
clicking on the color square I open
Google Chrome's color picker with the
color picker I can use the eyedropper to
select another color on the screen I can
change the hue by dragging the slider I
can select a color and I can toggle
between the hex and RGB encoding of the
color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
