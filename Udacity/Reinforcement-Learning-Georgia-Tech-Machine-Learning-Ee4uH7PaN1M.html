and unsupervised learning that's pretty
good
the last one is reinforcement learning
whew now reinforcement learning is what
we both do so Michael does a little bit
of reinforcement learning here and there
you've got how many papers published in
reinforcement learning all of them
several I've sample the bay it has like
a hundred papers of reinforcement
learning something that he wrote with
his colleagues the great summary journal
article bringing everyone up to date on
what reinforcement learning was like
back in idea like one hundred and twelve
years ago 1992 people were saying yeah
we should probably somebody should write
a new one because the other ones getting
a little long in the dude but there been
books written or machine learning since
then that's it's a very popular field
that's why we're both in it Michael
tends to prove a lot of things um it is
not as not why I'm in it what wait what
you said it's a very popular field and
that's why we're in it no no no no did I
say that that's what I heard I didn't
mean to say that it is a very tight back
yeah let's do that again because I did
not mean to say that it is a very
popular field perhaps because you're I
don't think that's it when I was an
undergraduate I thought the thing that I
really want to understand I liked a I
liked the whole idea of AI but what I
really want understand is how can you
learn to be better from experience and
like I built a tic-tac-toe playing
program and like I want this tic-tac-toe
playing program to get really good at
tic-tac-toe because I was always
interested in the most practical society
impacting problems I think that though
journalize was pretty well to world
hunger eventually so so that was what
got me interested in and I was I didn't
even know what is called for a long time
so I started doing reinforcement
learning and then discovered that it was
interesting and popular well I certainly
wouldn't suggest that we're doing the
science that we're doing because it's
popular we're doing it because we're
interested in it yes and I'm interested
in reinforcement learning because in
some sense it kind of encapsulate Saul
the things I happen to care about I come
from a sort of general AI background and
I care about modeling people I care
about building smart agents that have to
live in a world with other smart agents
thousands of them hundreds of thousand
of them thousands of them some of whom
might be human and I have to feel some
way to predict what to do over time so
from a sort of technical point of view
if we can think of as supervised
learning as function approximation and
unsupervised learning as you know the
size impact description what's the
difference between something like
reinforcement learning and
those two supervisors are in particular
so often the way that supervised
learning or sorry reinforcement learning
is described is is learning from delayed
reward so instead of the feedback that
you get the supervised learning which is
here's what you should do and the
feedback that you get an unsupervised
learning which is the feedback in
reinforcement learning may come several
steps after the decisions that you've
actually made so a good example that or
an easy example that would be actually
you take that cut program right so you
do something in tic-tac-toe you put an X
in the center and then you put a let's
say it Oh over here oh and then I put an
X right here nice and then you
ridiculously put an O in the center ah
which allows me to put an x over here
and I win all right now what's
interesting about that is I didn't tell
you what happened until the very end
when I said X wins right and now I know
I made a mistake somewhere along the way
but I don't know exactly where may have
to kind of roll back the game in my mind
and eventually figure out where it is
that I went off-track what it is I did
right and in the full generality of
reinforcement learning you may have
never made a mistake it may simply be
that that's the way games go but you
would like to know which of the moves
you made matter now if there were
supervised learning problem I would have
put the X here he would put the O there
on the top that's good I would have put
the X here and then when you put the O
there would have been that's bad the O
goes here hmm or something like that
we're told where he should have put the
up but here all he gets is eventually
some kind of signal saying you did
something well you did something poorly
and even then it's only relative to the
other signals that you might have gotten
right so then reinforcement learning is
in some sense harder because nobody's
telling you what to do you have to work
it out on your own yeah it's like
playing a game without knowing any of
the rules or at least knowing how you
win or lose but being told every once in
a while that you wonder you've lost okay
many times I feel like that I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
