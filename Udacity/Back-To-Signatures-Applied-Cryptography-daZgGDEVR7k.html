is talk about how to use RSA to solve
the problem of signing a document this
is what we started with as one of the
key motivations for asymmetric
cryptography so this would be the
straightforward way to do this that
Alice would take the document encrypt it
using her private key that produces a
cipher text which is really the signed
document anyone who has her public key
including Bob can now use the encryption
using a public key on that signed
document and obtain the document and
verify because this document was
decrypted using Alice's public key that
only Alice could have created it the
problem with this approach is RSA is
very expensive we don't want to use it
on large documents it costs about a
thousand times as much computing power
to do one RSA encryption as it does to
do symmetric encryption so that means we
don't want to encrypt the whole document
like this we need to do something else
so the question is how should Alice sign
a large document M we'll assume that
Alice has a public key known to anyone
who wants to read the document a private
key known only to Alice an
implementation of RSA and H a secure
cryptographic hash function which one of
these options makes the most sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
