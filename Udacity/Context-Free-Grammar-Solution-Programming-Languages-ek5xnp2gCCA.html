a finite number of utterances no this
one produces an infinite number of
utterances I can keep looping around
Rule one as many times as I want and in
fact this is one of the glories of
context-free grammars that they can
often accept an infinite number of
strings thus giving you room for
creativity based on just a finite
grammar context-free grammar can capture
a to the end B to the end yes it looks
like this it's just like the balanced
parentheses one but with a and B instead
so by yes I of course meant yes
context-free grammars are more powerful
than regular expressions yes here more
powerful or more expressive means that
there are some languages remember a
language is a set of strings that
context-free grammars can recognize that
regular expressions cannot this is one
of them a to the N B to the N can't be
captured by regular expressions but it
can be done by context-free grammars and
therefore they are more powerful
context-free grammars can tell if a
program declares a variable before using
it no if you think back to our grammars
for JavaScript we couldn't tell the
difference between a variable that had
been declared and one that hadn't been
yet that's a context sensitive property
so we won't be able to check it with
context-free grammars we could only
notice that later when we're doing
interpreting or in a statically typed
language if we were type checking things
to make sure we were using integers and
strings correctly we might also check to
see which variables were in scope but in
general it's very hard to tell if a
variable has already been used that
depends on the previous program that
previous program is the context
context-free grammars don't get in the
context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
