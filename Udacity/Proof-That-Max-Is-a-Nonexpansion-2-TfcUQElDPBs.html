thing I want to point out is that we can
reintroduce these absolute value signs
without killing anything well because we
can this is a positive quantity and so
taking the absolute value of doesn't
change it so the last little thing to
point out is that if we take the max of
this same quantity substituting in
different values of a this can only get
larger or no smaller because this a that
we're maxing over includes a 1 so we can
definitely achieve at least this value
but it's possible that some other action
will let us achieve an even larger value
but by maxing we can't have it achieve a
smaller value I mean we could achieve a
smaller value but it'll be at least the
max will be at least as big as what we
get for a 1 right and with that in place
that actually completes the chain of
inequalities from here to here so we get
this non expansion property for the max
operator here that the max operator is
being used here as a sort of a way of
summarizing these functions F and G ok
so let me just say that last thing back
you make certain I got it so I'm with
you all the way to F of a 1 minus G of a
one you went to the absolute value signs
that's pretty easy because we already
knew that value is positive that
difference was positive by construction
and then that last step you've noticed
that the difference between a 1 f of a 1
and G of a 1 is some number you're
maximizing all over all possible age you
could stick into F and G it has to
include a 1 by definition which means
the max might be bigger but it couldn't
be smaller than a 1 and so therefore
you're bounded from above excellent good
good good yeah well said that's really
cool now forgotten why we did this
that's I find that's often true for me
as well that this this requires enough
of my attention that I lose context but
the context was that we had this step in
our proof that the bellman operator is a
contraction we needed we needed it to be
true that summarizing the the Q values
at a given state using a max was going
to leave us with something that is no
farther apart than the maximum
difference between the two functions
that we started with ok yeah I remember
that maybe you can show me the equation
again in particular it was this this
step right here where essentially we had
to one way to think about it is move
this max out of the absolute value so if
we compare that
what we just proved that that's what we
did we kind of move the max out of the
absolute value right that's a that's
awesome good okay so I get it so the
bellman operators a contraction operator
value iteration works yes indeed now I
went through a phase of my life where I
got really kind of fixated on non
expansions and identified a whole bunch
of other operators other than max that
are also non expansions and that
actually gives us a way of analyzing a
whole bunch of other kinds of decision
processes right so not just these
standard markov decision processes where
we're trying to maximize expected reward
but we can we can do a lot of other
things and this same kind of proof is
going to end up holding so we're gonna
get back to that in a moment but first i
want to talk about how we use this
property now that we've established it
to prove the convergence of q-learning
right to prove that this this
interesting way of updating the Q values
over and over again in the face of
experience actually does in the limit
leads you to getting the solution to the
bellman equation okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
