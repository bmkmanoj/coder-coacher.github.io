model let's come back to a parallel
program so a parallel program is making
read write accesses to shared memory
some of them are for data and some of
them of a synchronization now so far is
a sequentially consistent memory model
it does not distinguish between accesses
coming from the processors as data
accesses a synchronization accesses it
has no idea it only looks at the
readwrite access is coming from an
individual processor and honoring them
in the order in which it appears and
making sure that they can be merged
across all these processes to preserve
the SC guarantee so the upshot is that
there's going to be coherence action on
every readwrite access that the model
sees if this guy writes to a memory
location then the sequentially
consistent memory model has to ensure
that this right is inserted into this
global order somewhere in order to
insert that in the global order
somewhere it has to perform the
coherence action with respect to all the
other processes that's the upshot of not
distinguishing between normal data
accesses and synchronization accesses
that is inherent in the SC memory model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
