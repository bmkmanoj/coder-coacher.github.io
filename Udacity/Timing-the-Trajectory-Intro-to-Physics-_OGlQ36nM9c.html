picture the way it's actually become
distracting with the person in all this
unnecessary information I'm just going
to draw this diagram which boils out the
essential information one thing I'd like
to point out before we keep solving this
problem Delta Y now in reality the ball
starts at ground level goes up to some
maximum height and then ends at ground
level since it starts and ends at the
same altitude well Delta Y is really
equal to zero so maybe I shouldn't call
it Delta Y instead let's solve for the
maximum height the ball reaches so just
like I did before I'm going to approach
this problem by looking at the vertical
component first now actually this seems
like it could be pretty difficult I've
only got two pieces of information but
that's not entirely true so let's
exploit the one other fact we know about
one-dimensional motion we know that when
object reaches the absolute peak of its
trajectory its vertical velocity is 0
aka at this point v y equals zero it's
also true that an object spends just as
much time going up in its trajectory as
it does going down that's not something
I'm going to prove for you here but it's
something you should definitely talk
about in the forums what's also true is
that when a ball starts and ends from
the same altitude same height it takes
the exact same amount of time to go up
as it does to go down we could say T up
equals T down ok now we're getting
somewhere let's use this equation well I
know what the highest point the balls
vertical velocity is zero the total
velocity is in zero because it's still
moving towards the right but it's not
moving at all vertically and that equals
the initial vertical velocity plus
acceleration times time and this is
where we have to be careful acceleration
here is negative 10 once I choose the
initial velocity upwards of 40
acceleration is downwards has to be
negative x time if I solve this I find
that the time is equal to 4 seconds now
can you tell me what I should put here
if this time represents the total travel
time of the ball going up and then back
down I'll give you a hint the answers
not for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
