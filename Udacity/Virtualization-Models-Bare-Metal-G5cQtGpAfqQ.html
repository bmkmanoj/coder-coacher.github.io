requirements for virtualization let's
take a look at the two main
virtualization models the two popular
models for virtualization are called
bare metal or hypervisor based and host
it they're also often referred to as
type 1 for the hypervisor based model
and type 2 for the hosted model for
virtualization solutions the bare mono
model is like what we Illustrated before
a virtual machine monitor or a
hypervisor is responsible for the
management of the physical resources and
it supports execution of entire virtual
machines only one issue with this model
are devices according to the model the
hypervisor must manage all possible
devices or stated differently device
manufacturers now have to provide device
drivers not just for the different
operating systems but also for the
different hypervisors that are out there
to eliminate this the hypervisor model
typically integrates a special virtual
machine like a service vm that runs a
standard operating system and has full
hardware privileges to access and
perform any kind of hardware
manipulation just like if it ran
natively on the hardware it is this
privileged VM then that would run all of
the device drivers and would have
control over how the devices on the
platform are used the service vm also
runs some other management tasks and
configuration tasks that specifies
exactly how the hypervisor would share
the resources across the guest VM for
instance this model is adapted by the
Xen virtualization solution as and also
by the VMware hypervisor the ESX
hypervisor regarding Xen both when it
comes to the open source version as well
as the version that's supported by
Citrix XenServer the VMS that run in the
virtualized environment are referred to
as domains the privileged domain is
called domme serum and the guest VMs are
referred to as Dom use then is the
actual hypervisor and all of the drivers
are running in the privileged domain in
Zera so the management of all of the
devices has to involve the execution of
the drivers that are part of dom0
given that VMware emits hypervisors for
first market humor still owns the
largest percentage of virtualized server
course so the server course run the ESX
hypervisor given this fact viewer is in
a position to actually mean they'd from
the vendors that they do provide the
drivers for the different devices that
are going to be part of the hypervisor
now this is not as bad because this is
really targeting the server part of the
market space and in servers in data
centers they're not going to be that
many devices or they're going to be
relatively fewer devices compared to
what you would see on your laptop or
desktops or in general the client
platforms to support a third party
community of developers viewer actually
also exports a number of EP eyes so this
is not just for the sake of the
developers but also for users when they
want to configure exactly the kinds of
policies that will be enforced by the
hypervisor and in the past the ESX
architecture was such that there was a
control core or control domain if you
will that was based on a regular
operating system that was based on Linux
but the right now all of the
configuration related tasks are
configured via remote API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
