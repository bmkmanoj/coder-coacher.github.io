memory I want to give sort of a bird's
eye view of the history of shared memory
systems over the last Oh 20-plus years
my intent is not to go into the details
of every one of these different systems
because that can take forever but it is
just to give you sort of the space
occupied by all the efforts that have
gone on in building shared memory
systems both are in hardware and in
software i encourage you to surf the web
to identify papers and literature on
these different systems that have been
built over time just to get a
perspective on how far we've come in the
space of building shared memory systems
a few thoughts on the software side
software DSM was very first thought off
in the mid-80s the IV system that was
built at Yale University by Kylie the
clouds operating system that was built
at Georgia Tech and there are similar
systems built at UPenn this I would say
is the beginning of software distributed
shared memory later on in the early 90s
systems like meulen and tread marks were
built I would call them perhaps a second
generation of distributed shared memory
systems and in the later half of the 90s
there were systems like blizzard shasta
kashmir and beehive that took some of
the ideas from the early 90s even
further and in parallel with the
software DSM I would say there was also
a completely different track that was
being pursued and that is providing
structured objects in a cluster for
programming and systems such as Linda
and Orca were done in the early 90s
Stampeder Georgia Tech was done in
concert with digital equipment
corporation in the mid-90s and continued
on later on into Stampede RT and pts and
in fact in a later lesson we'll talk
about persistent temporal streams and
this particular axis of development of
structured distributed shared memory is
attractive because it gives
a higher level abstraction than just
memory to computations that needs to be
built on a cluster early Hardware shared
memory systems such as BB and butterfly
and sequence symmetry appear in the
market in the mid-80s and a
synchronization paper that we saw
earlier by mellow crummy and Scott used
BB and butterfly and sequence symmetry
as the experimental platform for the
evaluation of the different
synchronization algorithms ksr one was
another shared memory machine that was
built in the early 90s alewife was a
research prototype that was built at MIT
dash was a research prototype that was
built at Stanford and both of them
looked at how to scale up beyond an SMP
and build a truly distributed shared
memory machine and commercial versions
of that started appearing SGI Silicon
Graphics built SGI origin 2000 as a
scalable version of a distributed shared
memory machine SGA all takes later on
took it even further thousands of
processors exist in SJ optics as a
large-scale shared memory machine IBM
blue jeans is another example and today
if you look at what is going on in the
space of high-performance computing it
is clusters of SNP's which have become
the workhorses and data centers I very
much want you to reflect on the progress
that has been made in shared memory
systems and invite you to look at some
of the details of machines that have
been built in the past either in the
hardware or in software so that you can
learn the progress that has been made</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
