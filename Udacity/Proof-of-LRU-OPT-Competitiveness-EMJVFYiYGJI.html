of misses in an LRU cache to the number
in one with optimal replacement from
this lemma there's a corollary about
regularity you can design an algorithm
for an ideal cash and if that analysis
shows that the number of misses is
regular then an LRU cache will perform
just as well so let's see how to use
this suppose you design a matrix
multiply algorithm assuming a
conventional non Strawson scheme and you
do so for an ideal cash let's say that
your analysis shows your algorithm does
n cubed over L root Z misses for this
example let's further assume that the
line size is one word so will this
algorithm perform well on a machine with
an LRU cache let's check the regularity
condition what happens when you double
the cache size well it introduces just a
small constant factor so the regularity
condition is satisfied and because Q opt
is regular qlr you will be proportional
to it by the lemma you could also
evaluate the right hand side of this
relation here's what you get basically
an upper bound on the number of L are
you mrs. this brings us to one of life's
great pleasures well assuming you're a
bit of a geek or is it nerd let's just
say enthusiasts shall we the pleasure is
that the lemma is not hard to see for
simplicity let's assume that the
transfer size is one word now imagine
the sequence or trace of all load and
store operations performed by a program
divided this trace in two phases let's
define these phases in a special way in
particular suppose that each phase
references exactly Z unique addresses
just to be clear each phase might
contain many more than Z loads and
stores the phases might also have widely
varying numbers of loads and stores as
the illustration suggests but a number
of unique addresses is always exactly Z
in each phase now let's say the machine
has an LRU cache of size II think about
what happens during some phase let's say
phase I at the beginning of the phase
it's possible that the cache is full so
the first time each unique address of
Phase I is seen it could cause an
eviction thus by the definition of a
phase the number of
mrs. could be as high as Z now think
about what happens on a cache with
optimal replacement but half the
capacity Z over to remember this optimal
cash can gaze into its crystal ball to
see all future accesses so during the
previous phase i minus 1 what might the
optimal replacement policy have done
well it may have arranged itself so that
the first Z over two unique addresses
seen in phase I are exactly in cash that
would mean no evictions but since the
optimal cash is only have sizes the over
to then it must at that point start
loading addresses in other words the
smaller but all seeing cash has to
perform at least Z over two transfers
the competitiveness lemma then follows
from these two facts one is at most Z
and twice the other is at least Z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
