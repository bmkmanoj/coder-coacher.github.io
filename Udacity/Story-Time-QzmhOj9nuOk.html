state-of-the-art graphics were based on
pallets so you had a certain number of
slots from the different colors you
could display at once and typical screen
resolution was tiny imagine how chunky a
game would look at 320 x 240 or even 320
x 200 years later there were flip phones
with higher resolution it was certainly
a challenge to make games look good
especially when you were limited to 32
or 64 or even 256 colors if he wanted to
shave an object for example you had to
make sure to reserve space in the
palette for the color gradations usually
just a few inches each for the major
colors like red yellow and blue this
also made anti-aliasing tricky because
it's basically just color blending so
there goes more of your palette at the
time we were using dot products to do
rudimentary lights are shading
everything had a very cartoony look
since the colors didn't change smoothly
over the surface of an object and they
tended to pop between values as objects
moved in the scene we didn't care we
just thought it was cool that shapes
were more realistic looking even if they
were really crude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
