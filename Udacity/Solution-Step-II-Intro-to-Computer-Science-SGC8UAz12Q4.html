modify this a month to be correct for
all months except for February in leap
years so to do that we got to know how
many days there are in a month and I
need Wikipedia for this you may already
know here we go here's the number of
days in months we have 31 days in
January March May July August October
and December
so let's write our code and I'm writing
this using only things we've seen
through unit two if I was writing this
for real I would do something a little
bit easier to type and those are the
31-day months an easier way to write
this would be to just list them all like
this that would mean the same thing but
using a tupple so we'll keep things only
using things we've seen through unit two
so if the month is one of those we
return 31 if the month is February we're
going to return 28 and this is the case
we're going to have to do something more
complicated if it's a leap year and
otherwise we're going to return 30 so at
this point we should be able to add some
tests that should be correct now if we
are not in a leap year
the day after February 28th is going to
be March first and a month that has 30
days let's pick one is September will be
October first I think that's enough the
other test case I think it would be good
to add at this point is something that
looks at a whole year if it's a non-leap
year we should correctly have 365 days
okay so now I've got some more test
cases and they should be correct even
for months that don't have 30 days so
let's try see if I made any mistakes and
all the tests finished so it sounds like
they're correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
