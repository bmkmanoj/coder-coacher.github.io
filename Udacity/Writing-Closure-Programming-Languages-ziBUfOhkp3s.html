to write the first part of our parser
our parser is just going to build up
this big variable chart and we've
already seen how to seed it with an
initial value for chart state 0 and also
how to see if a string is accepted by
grammars in the language of the grammar
by checking chart T if there are T
tokens to kind of see if it has the
final state so let's say we're deep in
the middle of this we're currently
looking at chart sub I and we see X goes
to ABCD from J we're going to write the
following code in our parser we're going
to call a special function called
closure and pass it the grammar just as
we described before I which is going to
be a number that's the chart state we're
looking at X that's going to be a single
non-terminal a B that's going to be this
list here could be empty could have many
things and C D that's this list here
could be empty could have many things
and this closure function is going to
return all the new parsing states that
we want to add to chart position I so
it's going to return a list of next
States for each one of those we're going
to add it to the chart we've already
written add to chart together and we're
going to figure out if there were any
changes over all of the things you
returned for example let's say you
returned three things but two of them
were already in the chart since at least
one of those was a change then we want
any changes to be true this blue code
here this is locked in stone I'm
definitely going to use this but you can
write any definition for closure that
you like as long as it correctly
implements how the closure is supposed
to work Goforth
this is relatively tricky and here's my
hint if you're stuck do a list
comprehension over the grammar rules
remember that you're trying to return
States and every state is pretty much
like a grammar rule but with the
addition of that red dot somewhere in
the middle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
