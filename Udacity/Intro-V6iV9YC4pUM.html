today we're going to do just a little
bit on video today and I guess next one
will be our we're only going to talk two
of these lessons on video one could do
almost an entire class on computer
vision is applied to video and the
things that are different but we're not
going to do a lot of that a lot of what
you've learned can be applied obviously
to each of the individual images and
some of what you have learned of what
you've learned where they're essentially
two dimensional operators you can apply
those same operators in three dimensions
or other ways of thinking about video
but we're only gonna do a little in fact
talking about the three dimensions video
we're going to think of as a three
dimensional signal alright so video as
shown here is I have this image XY and
as time moves forward time could also go
that way it is that I've got this volume
of data and so a pixel inside a video is
actually a function of X Y and T alright
so sometimes you'll see me going like
this for video and I'm talk about X Y
and T you know that that's why I think
of videos I think of video as a volume
of data so let's talk a little bit about
some basic computer vision in video so
one might be object detection so suppose
your goal and we'll talk a little bit
about this next time is activity
recognition or you want to recognize
what's going on so you're going to
recognize the activity of objects of
people at serabit but there are these
entities doing something so you might
have to find these entities that is what
are the things in here that are moving
that are doing something that I need to
try to label what their activity is you
know nominally or notionally you can
think of as my goal is to find the
independently moving things that are in
this video so here I've labeled this
thing called a background subtraction
and it's a you know just example I mean
here we have a scene where there's some
cars moving and the idea would be well
you know we'd like to be able to find
all of these moving blobs all right in
this particular case all these moving
blobs are the moving objects generically
background subtraction is used a lot
it used to be that people thought that
background subtraction was trivial and
then they thought it was hard and then
they stopped thinking about it at all
it's still this notion of separating out
the entities is still a fundamental
research area in computer vision we're
going to talk about some simple stuff
here so the most straightforward
background subtraction is where you have
a static camera so the camera is not
moving and the idea being that if
nothing is changing in the scene that
nothing is moving there either and
there's nothing to do so you should go
home and get some rest all right
background subtraction as sort of simple
and overly simplistic as it is it is
used a lot in commercial systems traffic
monitoring where they're uh you know
counting cars or monitoring other things
going on various human action
recognition where you have people coming
by and you want to be able to say
something about walking running whatever
uh human-computer interaction so people
will build systems where humans interact
with a big display and to pull the
humans out from the background uh they
have to remove the background somehow
and sort of object tracking in general
so sometimes there what you'll do is
you'll compensate for the motion of the
camera so you move the whole image back
as if you had the camera state
stationary and then you do background
subtraction on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
