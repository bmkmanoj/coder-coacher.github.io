and we're here with John and new guess
would you mind telling us a bit about
yourself sure my name is Jonah nougats
originally from Hollywood but lived all
over California Arizona recently moved
to San Francisco in December of 2014
after being in Arizona for 22 years
worked at GoDaddy for the last ten and a
half and deciding to need to change of
venue I wanted to be where everything in
Mobile is happening so I looked on glass
door and looked up companies that had
like the highest employee reviews and
found credit karma and was very lucky to
tell an their been there since december
of 2014 and went from being an
engineering lead to the manager of the
iOS team and what got you started as an
iOS developer well I was working on the
hosting team at GoDaddy and there was a
guy a couple cubes down for me who made
like three hundred grand in two months
in two thousand and two thousand eight I
believe he wrote an app for the iPhone
that down had downloaded images from
Flickr and made it the background on
your phone so I decided right then that
I needed to learn how to do what he was
doing got myself an imac got an ipod
touch and created my first app so and
what was that app your fob it was an app
called I story writer so it was a
collaborative storytelling application
as an author you could create a story
and other authors could revise parts of
the story and suggest revisions had a
full revision control system built in so
the lead author could choose what
suggestions made it into the main line
of the story interesting wasn't really a
success but it taught me how to program
for iphone so you didn't made as much
money as the other guy I didn't know in
fact I actually put out more money for
like hosting and web design and
icons and graphics and all that stuff
but it was worthwhile if you could go
back in time and meet yourself as a
beginning developer what advice would
you give yourself there would be a lot
of technical stuff make sure to remember
your retains and releases things were a
little bit different back when I started
programming you how to do your memory
management yourself and there are a lot
of gotchas with core data which ended up
causing lots of headaches and crashes
just because I didn't understand that
you know core data is not thread-safe
and in this dub dub they see what is the
feature that it's cited you most at me
it's worth I think the continuity stuff
is pretty cool because we have so many
customers on old operating systems we're
not going to be able to use a lot of the
new features anytime soon we have to be
backwards compatible to iOS 8 now for
our upcoming release we actually drop
support for iOS 7 finally so many
developers have this or in the same
situation where they have to support
older versions of iOS what do you think
that is more challenging I mean there
are a couple different ways you can get
around that you can definitely introduce
features for the four people on the
newer version of operating system it
just depends on how much value you think
you're going to get out of introducing
these new features rather than just
being backwards compatible are you kind
of a Objective C or Swift kind of guy
well I've been a objective c developer
for a while now since 2008 I do like
Swift we made the decision at Credit
Karma to stick with Objective C until
Swift 30 is actually live you know we
didn't want to write code which we're
going to have to rewrite at some point
soon anyway so you might start using
Swift at this point yeah yeah and what
about a total beginner do you think that
Swift is a good option as a first
language yeah you started with Swift
instead of objective-c or some other
well I mean I started
developing with basic and Fortran and C
and Ada and C++ and Java so PHP and Perl
so I mean if Swift was available when I
started programming that be yeah that
would have been great but I think that
was a long time ago and you mentioned
that you're now moving to a managing
position yes how does that feel about
managing bits to managing humans it's uh
it's different things are very
straightforward with most of the time
with programming you have a task you go
you know write the code and get it
checked out and make sure that you don't
have any bugs in your code management
things are a lot more fuzzy and there's
a lot less training a lot of times when
I first became a lead they're like okay
you have people now have to manage them
but they teach you you know HR related
things like how not to sexually harass
people um just come and say yeah right
exactly your normal you're not doing
that sort of yeah but I mean I mean that
stuff that they have to do for
compliance reasons and then you know how
to give good feedback but actually the
day-to-day of managing people is
different in this kind of I think
something you have to learn for yourself
when you're an individual contributor a
lot of times you just focused on your
piece of work or your feature when your
manager you're responsible for the
entire team success so I spend a lot of
my time making sure that my developers
have what they need to get their job
done and to make the whole process
smoother make sure that they're happy
and what technical skills that you
acquired as a developer G think that map
are useful in this new role well I was
the there's a lot of stuff related to
the software engineering process like I
was a scrum master for multiple teams
over the course of about four years that
was one of the jobs that I was doing
when I came to Credit Karma
manager I was scrum master for a team of
22 which is really large for a scrum
team but that type of stuff leading
retrospectives and you know you know
facilitating meetings design meetings
and and story breakdown stuff like that
workshops that's all good stuff and you
still get to do some code write some
code um sometimes it's not a lot it's
hard to stay involved with that feature
development just because I never know
what my schedule is going to look like I
do try to go to we have lots of meetings
for like cross-functional sync meetings
where everybody will who's working in a
specific feature based on multiple teams
will get together in a room and talk
about progress in status and they're
happening the blockers so I go to all
those just to make sure I know what's
going on with basically everything that
my people are working on okay and do you
miss it developing yeah I do I keep
telling myself that I should start a
side project that's what I was going to
ask you if yeah well it's nice to have
something it's just hard to go home and
work after you've been at work all day
and every once in a while get the
motivation and start a project but i
always get sidetracked so there are many
developers that are going through the
same a career change that you've been
through so will you give them any advice
when you're moving from writing code to
managing humaniform fair ferals sure i
think one of the big things that i would
imagine it this is a big thing for me
just learning to give away control of
something that you've been working on
and trusting your ear developers to make
sure that they don't do the right thing
so a student of mine once told me that
when he found a very tough bug what he
would do was to have a gin and tonic
that would help him a lot to better
understand the problem what's your trick
with bugs
with a tricky ones actually I prefer
bourbon but usually what I try to do is
see if I can reproduce the bug those are
the reproducible bugs are a lot easier
to fix and kind of edge cases that
happen because of a race condition or
that are hard to reproduce so try to
come up with the steps to reproduce the
bug and then just trace through your
code to find out exactly what the root
cause of the issue is and just really
get really good at debugging as a
beginner developer what do you think
that a beginning developer can get out
of attending a conference such as our
conference try Swift shirts I think that
when you're a new developer you will
learn through you know maybe tutorials
online or reading a book going to stack
overflow apple development forums those
are great for learning how to do
specific tasks but typically the answers
that you get on something like
stackoverflow will be to solve your
issue in the most concise form which is
not necessarily good software design so
I think that's one of the things that
you can get from these conferences is
how to do something not only to solve
the problem but doing it correctly
following good design patterns that you
learn you know at some of these
conferences also the conferences are a
great way to network I know I have been
coming to WWDC and all comp for about
six years and I've noticed that I see
the same people over and over again so
it's really good way to meet the people
who are big in the iOS community and who
are you know kind of the thought leaders
in this area and what about a more
experienced developer do you think it
still makes sense to come to a
conference oh sure definitely I know
people go to WWDC there's a lot of value
and actually going to labs and working
with the with the Apple engineers on
maybe
problem you might be having in your own
code base or if you have any questions
about one of the new features you can
talk to them about that as well and also
the networking I guess it's yeah the
networking is great it's really great to
go out and meet other people in your
community because through the course of
your career you'll see these people over
and over again so at Credit Karma do you
have any specific tool or process that
you would like to share with other
developers sure so we use JIRA to track
tasks for engineers we have a con man
board which is used for just tracking
engineering tasks and then we have
another JIRA board that is used to track
features and in the future JIRA board we
have five different columns we have
product design engineering validation
and done and you know all products start
off or all features start off in the
product column when all the product
requirements are added the ticket gets
moved to design for the designers to
work on mocks once those are done the
ticket gets moved to engineering which
is where me and the other engineering
managers will go in and break down tasks
to put into our engineering board if
there's any iteration to be done as far
as like product or design the ticket
well the future ticket will get moved
into the correct column when they get
moved back to engineering we know the
engineering managers know that there's
additional work to be done and we can
break out any additional work tasks so
it's a great way to track you know
feedback from from executives or for QA
people or things that we don't want to
lose because they're just an idea they
can get added on to the future task and
iteration can be done as necessary is
there any app that you use the most of
the time what's your favorite app a
besides Credit Karma big fan of
hearthstone which one horse town
yeah it's a game it's a game okay okay
and is there any app that you wish you
had developed besides that flicker one
um facebook it's make sense so I just
moved to the Bay Area from Spain about
eight months ago and Europe and the US
are quite different and one of the
things that puzzled me the most besides
the schooling system was this credit
stuff so I Credit Karma actually helped
me a lot Oh understand the intricacies
of that black magic voodoo thing of the
credit score so please thank everybody
in your team it should be inside of a
pact that I think that every foreigner
should get an America for dummies and it
should include definitely credit karma
great little thank you very much for
akhirah having us and a pleasure yes
definitely thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
