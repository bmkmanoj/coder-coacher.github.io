that's going to do the crawling and we
said the process we want to follow is to
keep going as long as there are more
pages to crawl we can do that with a
while loop and we can use to crawl like
this in our test condition if a list is
empty that's interpreted as false if the
list is not empty that would be
interpreted as true so this means the
same thing as testing if the length of
the list is 0 it's a cleaner way to
write this by just doing well to crawl
inside the loop well we want to pick a
page to crawl we'll store that in the
variable page and I'll leave it as a
quiz for you to figure out a way to pick
the page to crawl there's certainly lots
of different ways to do this if you're
clever and can think about using all the
things we've learned about you'll be
able to have one line that both
initialize this page to the next page we
want to crawl and remove that page from
the to crawl list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
