features we want to include in our model
to identify the cars by their driving
pattern remember we have the choice of
selecting different distances we also
cleaned the data now we are going to
select features using distances sampled
over time as we know from previous
examples this can be broken down again
into several iterations investigating
what works best we will go through only
a few steps to ensure we are selecting
features that can give us reasonable
results let's now head back to our
ipython notebook again and see how we
can identify our features take a look at
the code in this block here the get
sampling intervals method takes the
intervals of time at which we are
collecting the data we also divide the
seconds by 60 to get our answers in
minutes the method returns an array
named sampling intervals let's run this
part of the code this part does not give
you any output since this merely defines
the method in this part of the code we
are simply going to see how many
different unique driver IDs there are in
our data let's run this part of the code
again you see we get an output of seven
we have seven different unique drivers
driving around in given patterns our
goal is to look at these patterns and
see if we can distinguish between each
driver before we do so we want to make
sure we have enough data for the
sampling intervals that we have in the
data in the next line of code we make an
array for all the sampling intervals for
all the people next we want to make a
scatterplot of all the sampling
intervals let's first make the plot and
then we will see what the plot is
showing us again use the play button to
run that piece of code if everything
goes well
you would get a plot that looks like
this let's take some time to investigate
what this plot is showing us in the
x-axis we actually have the index of all
the data points in our array in the y
axis we are plotting the inter sampling
time now calculated in minutes so what
this means is there are some data points
that have inter sampling times that are
quite high in time in this case 750
minutes in this case around 800 minutes
however notice most of the points have
very short inter sampling times in fact
if we take about 60 minutes as our inter
sampling time we will capture most of
the data when building your features it
is important to make sure that after
selecting the features you have enough
data to do your analysis so by looking
at the data we concluded that a 60
minute or a 1-hour inter sampling time
will leave us with enough data this is
an important point whenever we have a
time series data it is important to know
at what intervals we are making these
measurements now we come to another
question how many points or features
should we select we have actually 24
choices if we take one our inter
sampling times the 24 choices being
location at the first hour of the day
second hour of the day third hour of the
day and so on and so forth up to the
24th hour of the day let's say we select
four features that means we will collect
the location of a person at four
different hours of the day and use each
of these locations as a feature now
another question rises will we have
enough data for the chosen features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
