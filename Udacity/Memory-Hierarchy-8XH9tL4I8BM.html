consideration in cash design is the
trade-off between speed and capacity to
help understand the impact of this
trade-off
I'd like to visualize requests from the
CPU to main memory like this where the
orange lines represent the request to
the CPU we would like the cache hit rate
to be high and the speed to be fast
these goals however are somewhat
contradictory we can have a small but
fast cache and just accept that this
would have a low hit rate being only
able to intercept quickly a few of the
requests from the CPU or we could have a
large cast but this would be slow there
either because of the physical
limitations like the speed of light or
because of the high cost of fast
hardware so we intercept more requests
from the CPU but we aren't able to
return them as quickly what is the right
trade-off well it's hard to say but
fortunately we don't just have to make
one choice we can trade-off side versus
speed multiple times at various levels
within something called the cache
hierarchy what is not in the CPU
registers we look for in an l1 cache
what's not in an l1 cache we look in the
l2 cache on multi-core processors there
might be even a third level of cache
what's not there finally we look for in
main memory even main memory however we
can think of as a cache for what is on
disk or we can also think about maybe
main memory as a cache for what's on the
file system notice here that the top is
smaller faster and costlier per byte and
as we go down the hierarchy we get
things that are bigger slower and
cheaper per byte and if we do a good job
of keeping the data that we are going to
access next in the higher levels with a
hierarchy that is if we can keep our hid
rates high then we can get the speed of
the top part of the pyramid but have the
capacity and the overall cost per byte
of the lower end of the pyramid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
