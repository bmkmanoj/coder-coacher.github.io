Carolina and I was adopted after birth
I'm Ryan salvadoran from Maryland and I
am lactose intolerant I'm Carol Kushner
I'm from woodside California and i have
the bracha to mutation which predisposes
me to the possibility of breast or
ovarian cancer I'm Kagura cowboy I'm
from Kenya and I have dark speak with
dark skin pigmentation as well as being
from an area that has a high frequency
in sickle cell anemia I'm Ginny Foose
originally from Boston but now from the
bay area I have a condo pleasure which
is the most common form of dwarfism
great thank you so much for being you
know as we go throughout the course
we're going to talk a lot about in depth
the biology of the traits that you guys
are here to represent for us we're going
to teach gene regulation we're going to
teach inheritance patterns and dominance
we're going to teach about mutations and
complex traits as well as how to trace
our lineage and family ancestry and as
we get on this journey to do this it's
probably a good idea for us to maybe
better define the traits that we have
and that's not an easy process sometimes
we have traits and we may think they fit
neatly in certain categories but then we
start thinking about them in different
ways and we think it's not so simple
anymore so for anyone is interested I
want you to sort of take the tray
picture here to sort of talk to us about
in this course and I want you to try to
tell me first if you think your trade is
visible or hidden and then physical or
behavioral and then innate or learned
and let's start with Ginny over here
what do you think about that do you
think you're what i think my trade is
visual visible invisible yes i think
that my it's a physical issue and at
times an emotional issue
and I think it has shaped who i am in a
good way absolutely cougar II what do
you think tell us about let's focus on
skin pigmentation would you classify
that as a visible or a hidden trade
isn't visible in general yes so visible
treat this is the cooler behavioral
physical and innate or learned it's
innate n80 right so pretty that's more
of I guess more of a straightforward
kind of like contra pleasure in tourism
you know they sort of fit into more
easily defined categories um Carol tell
us a little bit about a bracket to
mutation well bracket to mutation is
invisible and I didn't know I had bracha
to mutation and I it's invisible mm-hmm
and I did take steps once I found out
too I took steps to address the issue
are there any um would you describe
obviously this seems to be an innate
trait right it's not anything you could
change ray and and it's most likely a
physical trait and it manifests
physically not behaviorally right in any
real way it could manifest it's good
right now it doesn't right so it's sort
of a little unclear like whether or not
it will have an effect or well right all
right Ryan what about lactose
intolerance so in terms of visibility
that's a little trickier because it's
not you can't tell by looking at me that
it's that I'm lactose intolerant but if
you watch me you can you can tell kind
of by my choices that I make while I'm
eating if I'm at a restaurant with
friends then you might be it was a wire
treating that pizza why are you taking a
pill while you eat your food so that
sense it's visible and hidden but it's
definitely what about physical or
behavioral they're sort of these yeah
that's the same thing so it's definitely
a the trait itself is physical but it
can manifest it changes your
very interesting and this is something
learned or innate it's definitely an
eight but you learn that you have
exactly and sterling what about adoption
that's sort of a tricky kind of trade
well it it's hard to define that as a
trait cuz i have a whole host of traits
that are all physical hidden innate
learned they fall into both categories
from all the tricks that I have I just
don't know you know my biological
relatives if they also had those traits
and what how their genetics contributed
to the traits that I'm now expressing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
