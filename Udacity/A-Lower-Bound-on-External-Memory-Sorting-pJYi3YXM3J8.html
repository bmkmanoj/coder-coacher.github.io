has a memory transfer complexity of an
over L log base a Z over L of n over L
so is that good or bad as it happens
it's as good as we could hope for
asymptotically speaking let's see why
you start with n items and for
simplicity let's say that these items
are unique initially you haven't seen
any of the items yet so all you know is
that there are n factorial possible ways
in which you might order the data right
yikes that's a lot of orderings of these
orderings the goal of sorting is to find
a specific one in which all the items
are in for example ascending order from
this point of view here's a sketch of
one way to determine a lower bound
suppose you read some data from slow
memory from this data you learn
something which reduces the number of
possible orderings now let's be a teeny
bit more precise suppose there have been
t minus 1 transfers let K of T minus 1
to know the number of possible orderings
that remain and remember initially there
are n factorial such orderings suppose
that after you do t minus 1 reads you
now do another read of block size L from
slow memory to fast memory if you've
never seen these items before then there
are L factorial ways in which you can
order them now if there are any other
items in fast memory already let's
suppose that you already know their
relative ordering so how many ways can
you order up to Z minus L old items plus
the L new items it's at most Z choose L
times L factorial this is the factor by
which the number of possible orderings
might go down then after T reads here's
the lower bound on the number of
possible orderings it's n factorial
divided by Z choose L times L factorial
quantity to the power T now this count
is actually a little bit more
conservative than necessary the L
factorial factor assumes that we don't
know the order of the Li domes that we
just read but if you've read the L items
before then that won't be the case
that's because you can only perform an
over L reads of items that have never
been read together before
thus we can refine this estimate of the
lower bound on K of T in
particular L factorial to the T becomes
L factorial to the N over L they're
almost done what you want to know now is
when does this right-hand side equal one
that is wind is only one ordering remain
the smallest value of T such that this
happens is our lower bound on the number
of transfers that turns out to be what
we were after
and over L log basis the over L of n
over L to get this result you just need
to comment approximation identity is
plus a little algebra I'll post a nice
set of notes by Lars argA that explains
all this in detail in case you're
interested and you are definitely
interested because you love this stuff
you love it that's you making out with
the stuff shame on you this is a family
