a good question and these questions come
from observation I've been observing
that my co-workers here at Udacity drink
coffee every single morning right when
they come in I want to know why so I
think that there might be a good
experiment there I'm going to wait here
till somebody comes so I can figure out
what's going on we got someone good
morning Andy good morning Lauren how are
you fine I see you're making coffee you
drink a lot of coffee why is that um it
makes me more effective in the morning I
work better and faster I guess are you
saying that it decreases your reaction
time no I didn't say that but I guess
yeah I guess it probably increases my
reaction time you mean decreases do you
want me to stop asking questions this
early in the morning that would be that
would be fine well thank you Andy I
think I have an idea for a good
experiment I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
