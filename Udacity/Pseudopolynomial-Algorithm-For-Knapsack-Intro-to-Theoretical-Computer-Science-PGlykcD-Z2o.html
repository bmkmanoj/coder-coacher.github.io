because in a way and this is very
informal of course it is among the
easiest np-complete problems so whereas
clique and independent set for example
seem to be very difficult knapsack
allows for some pretty interesting
algorithms and one of those algorithms
which will be important for our pitas is
called a pseudo polynomial algorithm and
you'll soon see why it is named that way
I'm first going to explain the algorithm
to you so you're given an instance of
knapsack which means you're given n
objects each one has size s so we'll
just label those sizes here s 1 s 2
until you get to s n each object also
has a value so the values will be
labeled in the same way so you have V 1
V 2 and so on and get until you get to V
n and now here's the algorithm to solve
knapsack the algorithm basically works
with a table that looks like this the
table has n rows 1 2 3 down to n and the
table has a lot of columns 1 2 3 4 5 and
so on and so on and so on until we get
to a number that I'll call V and by V I
mean the sum of these values here so the
total V 1 plus V 2 and so on plus V n
will be called V and this is the table
that will now use of course I still have
to tell you what values go into that
table each cell here in this table is
going to have the following meaning I'll
call the row that we're at I and I call
the column that we're at J then this
cell here in row I and column J has the
following meaning the cell here in this
table will be the minimum size required
to achieve a total value of exactly J
using the objects 1 2 3 4 and so on
until you get to I so you cannot use all
objects so for example in the first row
you can only use object 1 and the second
row you can only use objects one and two
and then the third row objects one two
and three and so on and that means that
sometimes of course it's not possible to
achieve a value of exactly J using these
objects and so we'll just write a dash
into the table if that's not possible so
let's use the example from before so you
have the objects a b c d e
F G and here we have the sizes and the
values so the sizes were 3 2 2 3 and so
on
and to construct this table here will of
course also have to label those items
here so this is item 1 this is item 2 3
4 5 6 7 so my first question to you now
brief quiz here what do we put in here
so how many columns does this table have
and how many rows does this table have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
