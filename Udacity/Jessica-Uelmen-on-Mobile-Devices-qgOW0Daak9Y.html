program manager for the mobile dano
degrees here at Udacity I thank you so
much for talking to us today yeah
absolutely happy to be here so the first
thing I want to ask about was this is an
EdTech class so many of our students
might be looking at developing
educational technology for mobile
devices so what are some of the unique
opportunities to take place on mobile
that we don't necessarily have on more
traditional computers yeah absolutely i
mean i think number one your phone is
always glued to you right i mean when
when is there an opportunity when you
don't have your phone on you so that
also opens the opportunity to learn at
any time so for example if you're on the
train if you're in a ridiculously long
queue just anywhere that you have time
you can start learning so I think then
thinking of a learning experience to
help students learn when they just have
the time at any time instead of at home
on the couch making time for it so it
sounds like mobile technology is great
for developing some educational
applications I'm guessing it's not a
matter of you know if you build it they
will come there are some things we can
do wrong with it so what are some of the
unique challenges or obstacles doing
good mobile technology for education
yeah i think when i think of it i think
there's two real ones that stick in my
mind for one there's programming
challenges right i mean how do you do
complex programming challenges on a
phone and you know on most mobile
devices like the iphone in particular
you can't compile anything it's against
apple's terms of service so how do you
teach programming in that regard and
then also how do you make it not so gay
me right i mean how do you make people
feel like you're not just progressing
through a level and it's like like math
blaster or something right i mean how do
you make it a substantial learning
experience I think one company that does
that very well is duolingo I think that
then learning a language it's great I
can fit small trunk chunks in at any
time learn words come back and revisit
things and it doesn't feel gay me it
feels like I'm actually learning and
making progress each time and imagine
language is a particular one where being
able to learn on the go is very valuable
because it's something you use you know
every day throughout your life as
opposed to programming you're not
usually actually doing programming on a
train your programming at home but there
are other skills we learned that we
would actually use in those contexts
absolutely so are there any um new
trends and new emerge
parts mobile technology their emerging
that will be useful in developing future
educational technology so actually I
think one of the most exciting things is
the watch I mean so I have an Android
watch and its really surprised me at how
useful it's been if for nothing else
just reminders hey you've got a meeting
or hey you need to do this so if for
anything else helping students set those
learning habits to really make time for
education could be a really really great
application moving forward yeah that's
very true I really thought about that
but that could be very useful for things
like a guided tour of a museum or
something like that it seems like an
almost a silly little difference to have
the device be on your wrist or in your
pocket either way they're always on you
but just that hands-free and always
visible nature of it can really change
things no absolutely and maybe there's
even like bite-sized learning segments
that you can get we're all the sudden oh
your wrist vibrates here's a quick you
know question or like learning snippet
that you can quickly look at answer and
then move on yeah absolutely yeah that
makes a lot of sense and by the same
token are there any so when we think
about these on mobile devices for
education I think we often think about
the fact that they have a screen they
can show us information their web
enabled it's pretty much it but they
have a lot of other things like cameras
and GPS and microphones and things like
that can those also be used for
education some ways yeah absolutely in
in certain ways so one of the examples
that I first think about is I'm really
interested in hardware I come from an
electrical engineering background and
learning experiences for hardware
becomes inherently a lot more
challenging so devices like the camera
for example if you're building a printed
circuit board or building a circuit and
maybe it's not working properly and you
don't know what's going wrong it's not
like you can send an email to your
professor and say here's a digital
version of my printed circuit board or
my circuit what's what's going wrong
maybe taking a picture or a video and
then being able to easily send it
provides a lot more opportunity for
faster feedback and then even assessment
at the end of the day yeah that makes a
lot of sense I'm so we might have
students in this class who are looking
at developing their projects of their
class project using a mobile device give
me suggestions just as we sign off for
them if they're looking to do that I
think in a lot of ways keep it simple I
think that that comes up a lot people
get
entranced by the phone as a medium and
in 10 don't want to throw a lot of
features and a lot of different things
into it so really get to basics and try
not to let feature creep come in so much
so that it becomes this you know giant
app that no one can um I think that's a
big thing and then also just avoid
gamification um if you can it's just
it's such an easy thing to slip into and
such an easy thing to to not do right so
to try to avoid that whenever possible
and now you see why I want to talk to
Jessica as well because as you probably
know by now i am not a particularly big
fan of gamification either so um thanks
so much for talking to me is my pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
