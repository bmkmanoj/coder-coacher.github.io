ready to make changes to code but we
need to get it and from the searching I
did earlier I gather we're gonna use
github yep and what is that what is
github so it's a version control system
that lets you keep track of changes that
you make to your code and lets people
collaborate easily okay yeah I know I
mean at Udacity you engineers are using
it and what are you guys doing with Gabe
yeah so basically at Udacity we have one
main master branch that everybody uses
as sort of the source of truth and then
people will make branches to that their
own separate branches that they then
make changes on and then submit pull
requests back to everybody else and
everybody else can can look at it
usually there's one particular code
reviewer who will approve the change or
say you know maybe you should change
this here or there
change this variable name whatever okay
so for our purposes we're not going to
be like merging anything back into the
original code what are we good yeah so
for our purposes we're just gonna check
out the main branch make some changes
and leave it at that that's gonna be our
own new thing now yeah okay cool so
let's install git sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
