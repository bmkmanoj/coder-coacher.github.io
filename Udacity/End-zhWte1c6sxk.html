science behind it that's a very abstract
algebra because in some sense it's all
about set theory right i mean basically
that's what you do you've got the binary
sets and then you do these operations on
sets and there's gray level morphology
uh you won't find much of it in the
computer vision literature anymore but I
say computer vision I mean conferences
that use the word computer vision in
their title like computer vision pattern
recognition european conference on
computer vision the international
computer vision you won't find a lot of
things people doing work and morphology
but if you go to certain pattern
analysis kinds of things where they're
doing syntactic operations you'll still
find mathematics of that being done
however even though it doesn't appear in
this computer vision research we use it
all the time because we use it to clean
up our results in order to be able to
get those great results that we can brag
about to our our our colleagues or to
get paid by industrial folks to build
systems that actually work so I think of
this as not sexy but very important I
had a whole bunch of jokes to follow
that and I couldn't use any of them so
I'll just say that it's kind of like me
all right talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
