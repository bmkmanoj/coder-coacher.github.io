we're gonna use the Flickr gallery's get
photos method let's play around with
this method in the Flickr's API Explorer
before we start coding aside from the
API key this method only has one
required argument the gallery ID I've
gone ahead and copied the gallery ID
you'll use in this project and pasted it
in like before we'll need to provide URL
underscore m in the extras argument
otherwise the response won't have the
URLs for the images we want to display
now let's call the method huh this is
strange this doesn't quite look like
what we had with my public photo stream
when we were testing earlier and that's
because we forgot to change the response
format to JSON and we're currently
looking at an XML response now you'll
notice the XML looks quite similar to
JSON and I'm showing this on purpose to
again reinforce the idea that data can
be sent and received in many different
formats over the network let's switch
this back to JSON and then call the
method again now this is what we
expected these results are almost
identical to what we saw with my public
photo stream but how are we going to get
this data loaded into our app
well my recommendation is that we start
with the URL itself the one that we see
here on the bottom let's copy it and
look at it piece by piece everything
leading up to the question mark
specifies the API then after the
question mark we have a series of
argument names followed by equal signs
and their value each argument value pair
is separated also by an ampersand I'm
going to fix this URL by removing the
last argument value because it's only
necessary in the API Explorer for the
sleeping in the library app we just need
these argument value pairs and remember
when you build your version of the app
you'll need to use your own API key
because the one provided here is just a
temporary one given by the API Explorer
now let's test a URL like this using the
postman tool that we saw earlier and the
results look good these are essentially
the same results that we had in the API
Explorer except they're formatted a
little bit nicer and with that I think
we're ready to get started doing this in
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
