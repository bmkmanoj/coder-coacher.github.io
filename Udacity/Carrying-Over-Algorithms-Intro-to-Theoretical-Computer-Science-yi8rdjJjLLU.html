algorithms for Alice who is of course
very happy about this and we've also
found a factor two approximation
algorithm for the problem that Dave was
working on so Dave is of course equally
happy now the question since Alice and
Dave apparently are working on problems
that can be approximated very well what
about Bob and Carol and as you remember
the problems that Bob and Carol are
working on are closely related to the
one that Alice was working on so Alice
was working on vertex cover bob was
working as you'll remember and click and
carol was working on independent set so
we already know that we have a factor
two approximation algorithm for vertex
cover and from the previous units you
also know how closely vertex cover is
related to well first of all independent
set but also click given the close
relation we take this algorithm here and
simply carry over our inside for vertex
cover to click an independent set so the
question now is given this factor two
approximation for vertex cover and given
the close relation of vertex cover to
click an independent set do we now also
know that there is a factor two
approximation for clique and independent
set and I'm just writing independent set
as is here to save some space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
