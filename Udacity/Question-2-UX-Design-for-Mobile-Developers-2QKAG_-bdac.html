students to make it through this class
there are probably a lot of responses in
that thread and in this question you're
really going to take advantage of the
forum and the way you're gonna do that
well let's write it as a flow first
you're gonna find somebody else's
response to the previous question but
when you do this make sure that you
don't read the review or anything but
the name of the app to begin with
because the second step is to form your
own opinion about this app what do you
like about it what do you dislike what
would you change once you've figured
these answers out for yourself you can
go on to step three which is actually to
take a look at this other students Prezi
you'll learn what they didn't like about
this particular app and how they would
fix it finally you'll respond just in
that same thread you'll respond to the
post that this other student has made
and this is the part we have to make
sure to be productive
nobody is wrong in these situations
different people like different things
in fact in the next lesson we're going
to learn that even though good or good
can differ between users we serve
systems and techniques that we can use
to ensure the products we build will be
good for our intended audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
