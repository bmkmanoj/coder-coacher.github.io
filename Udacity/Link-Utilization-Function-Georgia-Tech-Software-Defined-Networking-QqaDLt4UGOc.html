of the Internet's fundamental design
tenants is packet switching in a packet
switch network resources are not
reserved and packets are self-contained
every packet has a destination IP
address and each packet travels
independently to the destination host in
a packet switch network a link may be
shared by multiple senders at any given
time using statistical multiplexing as
we learn in previous lessons while
packet switch networks have their
advantages in particular it makes it
easy to achieve high utilization on a
shared link packet switch networks also
have the drawback that a large number of
senders can overload a network resource
such as a node or a link note that
circuit switch networks like the phone
network do not have this problem because
every connection effectively has
allocated dedicated resources for that
particular connection until it is
terminated so this problem that an
attacker who sends a lot of traffic
might exhaust resources is unique to a
packet switched network environment so
packet switched networks are extremely
vulnerable to resource exhaustion
attacks resource exhaustion attacks a
basic component of security known as
availability let's take a look at other
components of security as well in
addition to availability we would like
the network to provide confidentiality
for example if you were performing a
sensitive banking transaction or having
a private conversation with a friend
you'd like the Internet to provide some
level of confidentiality another
component of security is authenticity
authenticity assures the identity of the
origin of a piece of information so for
example if you're reading a particular
news article you may really want to know
that that article came from the New York
Times website as opposed to from some
other place on the Internet similarly
you might want to know that that
information wasn't modified in flight
that property is called integrity which
prevents unauthorized changes to
information as it traverses the network
now a security threat is anything that
might potentially cause a vile
relation of one of these properties an
attack on the other hand is an action
that results in the violation of one of
these security properties so the
difference between a threat and an
attack is simply the difference between
a violation that could potentially occur
versus an action that actually results
in a violation let's look at a couple
example attacks on different components
of security let's start by looking at an
attack on confidentiality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
