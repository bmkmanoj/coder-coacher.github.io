work let's see how we got that answer
when we do ratio problems it's important
to put the ratio and words before we put
numbers so the ratio I need to write is
the amount of chocolate chips over the
number of cookies so the ratio we want
to write here is how many ounces of
chocolate chips we need for how many
cookies we know that there's eight
ounces of chocolate chips so we know the
amount of chocolate chips but we don't
know the number of cookies because this
tells us we have two dozen cookies for
those of you that don't know one dozen
is equal to 12 for example when you buy
a dozen eggs you get 12 eggs so if we
have two dozen cookies that's going to
be 24 cookies so we need eight ounces of
chocolate chips for 24 cookies the
question says how many ounces of chips
we need to make 42 cookies so the number
of cookies is 42 and we want to know how
many ounces of chocolate chips we need
we know the number of cookies we need to
make is 42 and we have to find out how
many ounces of chocolate chips so this
is what we're looking for I'm going to
use the variable C in this case we have
two ratios when we set them equal to
each other that creates a proportion to
solve a proportion we simply cross
multiply when we cross multiply we get
24 times c is equal to 8 x 42 so we get
24 c equals 8 x 42 is 336 to solve this
all we have to do is divide both sides
by 24 3 36 / 24 is 14 so we get c equals
14 which means we need 14 ounces of
chocolate chips to make 42 cookies are
you ready to try another one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
