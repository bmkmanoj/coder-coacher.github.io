you've decided that you are ready for
this machine learning engineering a
degree program and in which case I
welcome you again before we get started
though let's talk a little bit about
what is machine learning machine
learning has been described as a lot of
things it's been described as the next
natural step for artificial intelligence
it's been described as applied
statistics it's been described as just
advanced algorithms and in reality it's
kind of all of these things like
artificial intelligence it's about
processing some data and understanding
data and reacting intelligently to it
like statistics about applying advanced
formulas to really make sense to compare
and evaluate and summarize data like
algorithms it operates on some data
input and provide some output so really
machine learning is about the next
synthesis of lots of different fields
it's for the next natural evolution for
a lot of things you've studied in the
past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
