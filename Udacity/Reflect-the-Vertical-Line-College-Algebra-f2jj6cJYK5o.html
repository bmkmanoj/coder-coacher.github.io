functions that we haven't really talked
about is the fact that they are well
functions here for example are the
functions who you're working with in the
last quiz we started out with the
equation y equals 4x and found that its
inverse is y equals x over 4 of course
the original equation is a function but
we can tell that its inverse is too it
passes the vertical line test we saw
that y equals 4 over X is its own
inverse it passes the vertical line test
to another fun fact about this is you
can tell it's its own inverse because
the function itself is symmetric across
the line y equals x now if we had a
function and we went through the process
of finding its inverse but the resulting
equation did not graph a function then
the original function would not have an
inverse at all I know that sounds kind
of complicated and that would involve a
lot of steps so luckily there's an
easier way to tell whether or not a
function will have an inverse it
involves graphing now I just said that
we can figure out if a graph represents
a function by using the vertical line
test and we also know that in order to
graph the inverse of a function we need
to reflect it in the line y equals x so
what if we decided to reflect a vertical
line in the line y equals x here I've
graphed a random vertical line I happen
to pick x equals 4 and the start of
black line is the line y equals x what
is the reflection of x equals 4 in the
line y equals x please write the
equation of this new line in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
