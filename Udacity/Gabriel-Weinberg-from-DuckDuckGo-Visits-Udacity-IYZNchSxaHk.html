the creator of DuckDuckGo this is one of
the coolest web search engines there is
and Gabriel pretty much built it all
himself up to the point where it had
millions of queries every day so tell us
about dr. Koh so I started out doing the
technologies you're going to learn in
this class namely crawling ranking and
indexing and I did that for a few months
and then realized that just doing those
would do enough to compete with Google
and so I started focusing on things that
I thought would be more value add like
specific crawling for spam and adding
instant answers and after about a year I
launched that and we slowly grew from
that to the point we are today where
we're getting about a million queries a
day as Gabriel mentioned there are lots
of creative things you can do to make
search engines better we want to
encourage you to do that and to use the
things that you've learned in the class
so we're going to have a contest at the
end of the class to see you can make the
best improvements to the search engine
the winners will be invited for a free
weekend at in Palo Alto will be
providing more details on the contest on
the website soon at the end of the seven
week course you want to build a search
engine quite as powerful as DuckDuckGo
is today but you'll have learned about
all the basic components that go into
making a search engine and you'll also
have learned a lot of computer science
and about programming and you should
have the tools you need to do something
cool on your own see you in class
