why do we need it I think we already
talked about that although their users
it's people who actually create
information and run applications that
manipulate such information but people
work for a company or a government
agency we're going to talk about that
and it's really their employer and
somebody who's trusted by them or is
acting on behalf of them should really
be able to specify how certain kind of
data can be shared first of all in a
taking the the power of you know
deciding how data should be shared from
the user and sending you can think about
this the user is being told you know the
right way to share this data is based on
you know this policy that the company
has and this policy could be it may
depend on and the the kind of company
that we have so for example hospitals
with electronic medical records and
stuff like that clearly have patient
records okay and we know that patient
health information their health
conditions are information about them is
highly sensitive and who can see it has
to be limited and how it can be shared
has to be limited and it's not really up
to just the hospitals they would want to
do it but there is the regulations that
force them to do this or force them to
control how agent records can be
accessed in the context of health
information we have HIPPA which is the
regulation that garment imposes on any
one entities like hospitals that collect
information that goes on to patient
records medical records and of course
there's a need to share that information
if you go see a different doctor they
need to have access to your medical
information but how access to it should
be created it's not the particular
person who does data entry for a
patient's record they don't get to
decide you know who else can see this
has to be decided by the hospital that's
informed by this regulatory policy
called HIPAA this is the you know
protecting people's health information
and privacy and things like that
we said in
Nitori access-control it's not just the
user owning a resource and being able to
control but it's really the users
organization or company hopefully this
example and the information being
medical records convinces you that
sharing of information has to be
mandated by someone other than the user
who's creating it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
