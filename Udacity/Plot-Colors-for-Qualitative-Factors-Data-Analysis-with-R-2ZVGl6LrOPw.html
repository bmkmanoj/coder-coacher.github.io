linear relationship between carat weight
and price after doing some
transformations but surely there are
other factors that influence the price
of a diamond when I was looking around
the Diamonds I noticed that clarity
seemed to factor into price of course
many consumers are looking for a diamond
of a certain minimum size so we
shouldn't expect clarity to be as strong
a factor as carat weight and I must
admit that even though my grandparents
were jewelers I initially had a hard
time discerning a diamond rated vvs1
from one rated si2 surely most people
need a jeweler's loupe to tell the
difference according to Blue Nile the
cut of a diamond has a much more
consequential impact on that fire
equality that jewelers described when
they talk about diamonds on clarity the
website states many of these
imperfections are microscopic and do not
affect the Diamonds beauty in any
discernible way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
