function to do what function to my
thinking of XOR is always good ah let's
do X or so what does XOR mean remind me
okay
XOR is exclusive or which means it's
true if a is true or B is true but not
if they're both true so it has elements
of both or and and in it right
and I think of XOR usually when I'm when
I'm like playing with light switches in
my house if I have a light that's
activated by two different light
switches it's usually an XOR function
with one is up the lights on if the
other one is up the lights on but if
they're both up the light goes back off
right the other thing when I think of
XOR is when people say or most of the
time when people say or when they're
talking they mean XOR really yeah so a
lot of times when people say or in
English they really mean XOR they say
well do you want to go to the movies or
do you want to go swimming
do you want to eat chicken or do you
want to eat fish and really they're
saying either/or I see if you want one
or the other but you can't have chicken
and fish or go swimming and the movies
no those things are not possible to do
together got it okay all right so how
would you do X or we got we still have
our two attributes a and B or because
it's a lot like or so what would you
want to do okay so to do X or we can
split on a okay and there's a true
branch and a false branch and what
happened with and and or at this point
is there is at least one branch where we
actually knew the answer at this point
but I don't think that's true here so so
if a is true the output might be true or
false it depends on B and if a is false
the output might be false or true it
depends on B so I was exactly right so I
guess in both cases we still have to
split on B okay all right so now it
should be relatively easy in a sense
that there's a separate leaf for all
possible inputs and so we can just write
the xor function on the bottom so if a
and B are both true then the output is
false because it's exclusive if a is
true and B is false then it should be
true because a is true if a is false and
B is true then it should be true because
B is true and if a and
B or both false then should be false
that's right and by the way if you were
to think about a little while it would
probably occur to you that this tree is
just another representation of the full
truth table ah very nice and in fact if
we wanted to do or again we could say
well I was very smart last time but I
could actually write or like this and
then just fill out the values at the
bottom if a is true and B is true then
yes if a is true and B is false then yes
if a is false and B is true then yes if
a is false and B is false then no and
this is a perfectly legitimate decision
tree to represent or because it
basically is just another simple
representation of the truth table but as
we pointed out when we did it last time
it's more of a decision tree than we
actually need I can see that because in
particular we don't actually need this
alright so this little difference here
between writing out the entire truth
table on the left as we did for XOR and
not having to write out the entire
decision tree on the right for or action
is going to turn out to matter when we
try to do things either more complicated
or with more attributes than we did for
these simple and or an XOR would you
like to see yeah that sounds really cool
