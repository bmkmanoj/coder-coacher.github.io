uses the phone on the go and they
probably sit down with their laptops
when they get home people probably visit
the same sites on both but that doesn't
mean that they've got the same intention
yeah while you may peruse your favorite
online retailer while you're on the go
you may not feel comfortable taking out
your wallet and typing in your payment
information in public or maybe you just
don't feel like dealing with tiny little
buttons and you're in a big rush so you
wait until you get home to actually make
the purchase it's perfectly reasonable
and developers who take advantage of
this button stand to convert even more
users there are a few ways you could
help users start a form on one device
and then finish on another for instance
you can offer them a way to share an
item through social channels or email or
there's an even simpler tactic save to a
shopping cart this lets users leave for
now without worrying because they know
when they come back later their items
will be waiting for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
