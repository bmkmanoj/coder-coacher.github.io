that we've talked about reduction we can
revisit that definition and say a
problem X is np-hard if we can reduce
some other np-hard problem to it which
what that really means is we can use a
solution to problem X to solve some
np-hard problem that means that solving
X has to be at least as hard as the
np-hard problem making it therefore
np-hard
now there's something sort of irritating
these circular or Turtles all the way
down in about this so we want to show
that some problem is np-hard we've got
some problem we have to show that we can
reduce some other np-hard problem to it
so we need that problem to be np-hard
how do we show that that problem is
np-hard well we can just show that
there's some other np-hard problem that
we could reduce to it and so on and so
on and so on and it doesn't really seem
like we could ever get anywhere this way
but the good news is it back in 1971
Steven cook showed gave essentially the
original np-hard problem and that is Sat
so Sat we know is np-hard and the way
that he showed that is really ingenious
he actually showed that if you if you
had something that could solve Sat you
could use it to simulate in polynomial
time essentially an NP computer right a
computer that makes these
non-deterministic choices and since
that's the case anything that we could
run on an NP computer we can turn into a
Sat problem and therefore that is as
hard as anything in NP so that's great
so Cooke got us off the ground here by
giving an np-hard problem so now we have
something else to target we have some
other way if we want to serve that some
problems np-hard we can just reduce Sat
to it and then we're done but at this
point now there's actually a huge number
of problems that are known to be np-hard
so that so if you encounter a new
problem it may already be known to be
np-hard or it may very well be that some
known and P hard problem can be reduced
to it so you don't necessarily have to
go all the way to sad to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
