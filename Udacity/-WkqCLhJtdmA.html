foundation for our app and now we're
ready to add in the vocab words do you
have an idea of what words we can
include yeah I came up with a list of
words here they are oh cool this is
great yeah at one point I was thinking
about using words for animals and places
but I figured that phrases would be more
useful yeah I think phrases will be fun
for our students to learn 1000 yesenin
oh yes that Andrea Michiko says could
she touch it sounds great
so Jessica how do we go ahead and build
the next step of that yeah there's a lot
of words on this list how about we just
focus on the first category for now so
the numbers category oh I see so we get
the numbers list working and then we can
just repeat the same pattern for the
family phrases and color words yeah
exactly so let's revisit the course map
and I can give our students an overview
of what we're gonna cover in this lesson
you with this so right now we're in
lesson two out of four so here are the
details of what we're gonna cover in
lesson two
so first we're gonna learn about how to
store a list of words in the app and
we're going to talk about data
structures such as a race an ArrayList
to help us store these words next we'll
learn how to display a list of words and
here's an example of what that looks
like in our numbers activity then we'll
go on to display a list of English and
Miwok word pairs and here's what that
looks like in the numbers activity and
lastly we'll get to add the words from
all the remaining categories so here's a
sneak peek of what that looks like in
all the activities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
