the rage and strife Institute in Indiana
but is used virtually worldwide each
code is for a laboratory test or a
clinical observation and is a number
with up to seven digits while the codes
themselves are deceptively simple they
contain a lot of information detailed in
their names which as shown here are
divided into five or six main parts
separated by colons in this example of
the first part the analyte our substance
of interest is glucose we can see that
it was determined to hours after the
patient consumed 100 grams of glucose
because the first part of the name is
divided into sub parts separated by a
carat here there are two sub parts but
there could be three the first sub part
glucose could also contain multiple
levels of increasing specification
separated by dots the third and fourth
parts the time aspect PT means a point
in time rather than a time range and the
system sample ser pas indicates that the
test was performed on the serum or
plasma components of a blood sample can
be modified by a separate sub part again
separated by a carat this table is a
more detailed explanation of each of the
parts of the name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
