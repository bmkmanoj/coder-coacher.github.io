common denominator well remember that we
have to find a common denominator in
order to add or subtract fractions in
our very first example we needed to have
90th in order to add these two fractions
together in the second example we needed
to have a common denominator of 2 K s
squared in order to add these two
fractions together once we have a lowest
common denominator we multiply the
numerator and the denominator and each
fraction by the factors that are missing
to change our fraction into an
equivalent form so for 18 it was missing
a factor of 5 so we multiplied by 5/5
likewise for the denominator 2's squared
we multiply this fraction by K over K
since K is the missing factor from 2's
squared when we multiplied by K divided
by K we're really multiplying by 1 and
we're changing our first fraction into
its equivalent form so let's go back to
our third example of finding the LCD we
found the lowest common denominator for
these two fractions and it was p minus 1
times P minus 2 times P plus 3 remember
we want to change these two fractions to
an equivalent form so here's your
question what should we multiply each of
these fractions by to get an equivalent
fraction with a lowest common
denominator of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
