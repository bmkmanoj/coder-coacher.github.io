a robot resides and let's assume the
board has no clue where it is then we
remodel this with a function I'm going
to draw into this diagram over here
where the vertical axis is the
probability for any location in this
world and the horizontal axis
corresponds to all the places in this
one-dimensional world the way I'm going
to model the robots current belief about
where it might be it's confusion is by a
uniform function that assigns equal
weight to every possible place in this
world there is the state of maximum
confusion now to localize the world has
to have some distinctive features so
let's assume there's three different
landmarks in the world there is a door
over here there's a door over here and a
third one way back here and for the sake
of the argument let's assume they all
look alike so they're not
distinguishable but you can distinguish
the dwarf rum the non-oil area from the
wall now let's see how the rover can
localize itself by assuming it sends us
and it sends us the standing right next
to door so all it knows now that is
located likely next to a door how will
this affect our belief here is the
critical step for localization if you
understand this step you understand
localization the measurement of AD war
transforms our belief function defined
our possible occasions to a new function
it looks pretty much like this for the
three locations and racing two doors we
now have an increased belief of being
there whereas all the other locations
have a decreased belief this is a
probability distribution that assigns
higher probability for being next to a
door and it's called the posterior
belief with the word posterior means
it's after a measurement has been taken
now the key aspects of this belief is
that we still don't know where we are
there's three tough password allocations
and in fact it might be that the sensors
were erroneous and we accidentally saw a
door where there is none so it's still a
residual probability
of being at these paces over here but
these three bumps together really
Express our current best belief of where
we are this representation is absolutely
core to probability and to move over
localization now let's assume the robot
moves say it moves to the right by a
certain distance then we can shift the
belief according to the motion
anyway this may look like it's about
like this so this bump over here
made it to here this curved end over
here and this guy over here obviously
this is a robot it knows it knows this
heading direction it's moving to the
right in this example but it and it
knows roughly our fired move now robot
motion is somewhat uncertain we can
never be certain where the robot moved
so these things will be little bit
flatter than these guys over here the
process of moving those beliefs the
device set is technically called a
convolution and let's now assume the
robot sends us again and for the sake of
the argument let's assume it sees itself
right next to a door again so the
measurement is the same as before now
the most amazing thing happens we end up
multiplying our belief which is now
prior to the second measurement with a
function it looks very much like this
one over here which has a peak at each
door and out comes a belief that looks
like the following there's a couple of
minor bumps but the only really big bump
is this one over here this one
corresponds to this guy over here in the
prior and it's the only place in this
prior that really corresponds to the
measurement of a door whereas all the
other places of dwarfs have a low prior
belief so as a result this function is
really interesting it's a distribution
that focuses most of its weight under
the correct hypothesis of the world
being in the second door and it provides
very little belief to places far away
from doors at this point Rubin has
localized itself if you understood this
you understand probability and you
understand localization
so congratulations you understand
probability and localization you might
not know yet but
it's really a core aspect of
understanding a whole bunch of things
I'm going to teach you in the class
