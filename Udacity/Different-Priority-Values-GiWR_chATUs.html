functions of the location request object
first of these was set interval now this
sets the desired interval for active
location updates measured as a period in
milliseconds so right now if it's set
for a thousand milliseconds that means
it will check the location once every
second that's pretty fast so if you
wanted to change that to be less
frequent for example once every ten
seconds you could just change this to
10,000 remember it's always measured in
milliseconds then we used set priority
this is used to set the priority of the
call as his name might suggest the
priority is a strong hint to the
location client about which location
services it should use there are many
factors about which physical devices
that will use such as the available
hardware in the phone it has four
potential values so let's take a look at
these this one that i'm showing priority
balance power accuracy will give you
accuracy to about a hundred meters it's
nicknamed block level accuracy for
obviously reasons its course and it's
very battery friendly compared to some
of the others priority high accuracy
will give the finest possible location
based on phone hardware but as you can
imagine this could impact your battery
much more priority low power will
request what is nicknamed city level
activity it gives you a range of about
ten kilometers it's a very low power
consumption activity and finally
priority no power will request the best
possible accuracy at no power cost so if
other clients in the app have gotten a
location this can actually be a passive
listener to them do note that if you
have set the access course location in
the Android manifest it will override
these settings and can effectively
reduce the frequency of location polls
as well as of you skating its accuracy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
