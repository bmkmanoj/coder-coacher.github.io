similar to things that you've already
seen we've just produced different
polynomial functions and rational
functions through combining functions in
different ways but now I think we should
do something totally new way back when
we first started talking about functions
I showed you a little visual I think it
looked like this it was a function
machine that takes an input and spits
out an output for example we could write
a function that relates the number of
wiper sets that Grant has sold let's
call it n the amount of money he makes
in the end his revenue which will find
using the function are so for example if
people spend $15 on a wiper set then our
of n will equal 15 n we can see that
this function machine is taking in n as
its input and spitting out our of n or
15 known as its output now if grant is
trying to increase his revenue or
increase our then he obviously wants to
increase the number of wiper sets that
he sells so how does he do that well as
we saw before the number of wiper sets
that he sells n is a function of the
amount of money that he spends on
advertising which I'll call d both
revenue and money spent on advertising
are going to be measured in dollars so
now we have that R is a function of N
and n is a function of D so how r r and
n and d all related to one another we
should be able to then draw a function
diagram that represents this
relationship which one of these diagrams
do you think is correct don't worry at
all if this seems tricky this is
definitely pushing the boundaries of our
understanding of functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
