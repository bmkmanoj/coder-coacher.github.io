need to remain balanced the left side
needs to equal the right there are some
choices we can make along the way to
help us with our math let's see what
those are I'm going to solve this
problem two ways when thinking about
solving this equation I'm going to
combine my like terms on one side of the
equation so here I'll have 3 B plus 32
and then on the right side of to be plus
47 I've listed my equation twice so now
that I can solve it two different ways
first we can subtract to be from both
sides 3b and negative 2b make positive 1
b i have 1 times be here but i don't
really need to write the one i can leave
it off the positive 32 comes straight
down positive to be and negative to be
some 20 so I don't list anything here
and then I have positive 47 in the end B
equals positive 15 but let's see another
way to solve this i subtracted to be
first but what if i didn't subtract the
to be what if i subtracted the three be
positive 3b and negative 3b makes 0 the
32 comes down the 47 comes down and then
to be a negative 3b make negative 1 B
and subtracting 47 we get negative 1 b
is equal to negative 15 so I'm not
interested in the negative value of B I
want to know the positive value of B so
I know if negative B equals negative 15
then positive V must be positive 15 we
could also think about multiplying both
sides by a negative one that would give
us our result B equals positive 15 so
when you're solving equations it's best
to look out for the variables do you
want to keep your variable positive or
do you want to make it negative it's
probably easier to work with a positive
be variable here sometimes we make
errors with negative signs so it's best
to avoid those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
