clock speed is not that the transistors
have stopped getting smaller and faster
even though transistors are continuing
to get smaller faster and consume less
energy per transistor the problem is
running a billion transistors generates
an awful lot of heat and we can't keep
all these processors cool power has
emerged as a primary driving factor
possibly the most important factor in
modern processor design at all scales
from a mobile phone that you keep in
your pocket all the way to the very
largest supercomputers the consequence
is we can't keep building processors in
the way we always have by making a
single processor faster and faster
when we do that we end up with
processors that we simply can't keep
cool instead processor designers have
turned to building smaller more
efficient processors in terms of power
and they then spend their extra
resources to build a larger number of
efficient processors rather than faster
less efficient processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
