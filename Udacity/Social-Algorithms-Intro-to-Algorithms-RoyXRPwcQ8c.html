currently a graduate student in computer
science he studies machine learning but
he's also a keen observer of the impact
of technology on world cultures he's
been an intern at several different
technology companies and he's going to
share some of his experiences with us we
have with us leukoc meadow ave leukoc
lives in South Africa and he's currently
going to graduate school in the United
States to get his PhD in computer
science he has intern at a number of
different companies and the summer he
interned with a company called meebo
that does some social networking can you
tell me a little bit about me Bo well
what is it that they had been doing and
where are they now meebo was a company
that did a couple of things one was they
had a chat up they are another is that
they also did advertising through
something called me boba and they also
then had a new product that was being
developed called the interest graph to
give you news so you would actually log
into the service cut up what your
interests are and you would either be
friends with other people on the network
and from there it will actually mine the
data that's created by all these people
to actually i'll give you news and
information that's relevant to you do
you have a sense of what sort of
algorithmic work they had to do to
support their they're helping in most
cases when you're looking at networks
what you tried with the things that are
very interesting to do first is dead
simple ways to actually recommend who
people should be friends with so this is
goes across the spectrum whether they
are Facebook LinkedIn your Twitter or
your meebo or maybe expand Google+ the
other things that then become more
interesting is finding out who is
important in a graph and this is
actually not as simple as just looking
at who has the most connections I that
has the most followers or the most
friends and things like that but
actually who who is the person where
information flows through so there's
there are algorithms that actually now I
try to do this and people are developing
them using different metrics to client
regard who's important given a topic
let's say so finding out who is very
important given
ice cream in California and those kind
of problems normally require you to do
some mathematical modeling of the
network states you have do you have a
sense of what a really simple example of
an algorithm might be that would
determine importance maybe not what
people are really doing but something
related to it one could be looking at
given keywords that people use and given
who uses those keywords and then looking
at if a person uses that keyword who
then after that three let's say shares
that keyword more and more right so
you're just looking at something called
the Cascade how information moves to a
network but if you can look at the
origin of where that keyword started and
see how fast it grows may be right or
how many people it gets too then you can
then look at them then go back to
figuring out who them is important so if
you could figure out let's say who is
important in burgers right then you
could then add the target advertising
towards that pest person to do
advertising new product and it tastes
credit then you can then get to more
people right so it's different to
advertising a burger to be I only don't
have a lot of people who follow me
because of my knowledge of burgers but
because but there could be other people
out there who will follow up because of
that information so if you can figure
out who those people are then you can
advertise to them and they can spread
information I did a project at Rutgers
one way it tried to figure out who was
important given a edge attainment TV
show and in this case I was too I was
trying to find out to was important in
trying to spread information about HIV
so in this case stuff about advertising
but it's actually very important in
educating people so if you can figure
out who spreads that information well
you can get to more people and you can
have more impact that seems really
important yeah I mean not just I mean
all over the world right there's these
issues are taking place what's your
sense of what social networks are like
in other countries outside of the United
States is it similar to the way it is
here are there different other
variations because of differing
bandwidth constraints you have some
social networks being
more used in some countries than that so
you have countries that use Twitter
because it's very easy to get on it's
very low bandwidth and also it spreads
information very quickly more quicker
than Facebook and it's open so obviously
everybody knows about the Arab Spring
now and today was very pivotal in that
in some countries there's other social
networks that are very big dead the
banner be big in the United States South
Africa and some of most of Africa use
something called mix it and xit which is
based in South Africa it was created it
and has a really huge user base in South
Africa I think orchid is still very big
in South America which it would yeah
there was a product by Google but it's
still spreading and just locally it's
very big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
