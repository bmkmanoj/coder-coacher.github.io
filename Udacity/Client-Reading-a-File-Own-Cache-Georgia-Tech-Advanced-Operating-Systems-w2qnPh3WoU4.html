not going to result in going through so
many hoops to get the data blocks this
is where caches come into play so when
you start the file name and an offset on
a client node you look up the directory
and from that you get an index and an
offset so this is a data structure which
is in the client memory and once you get
the index in the offset and if this file
has been accessed before it is most
likely in your own UNIX cash this is a
file cache of the file system and if it
is in your cash then you get the data
block in other words going from the file
name to the data block that is
associated of the file is all happening
through the client memory because of
local caching and there's a fastest path
for file access and hopefully this is
the common case now it is possible that
a file is shared or the same file is
being read by different clients at
different points of time but in either
case there is a possibility that a
particular file has been accessed by a
client and therefore in the cache of
that client and so the next possibility
is that you start with the directory you
don't find it in your local cache and if
you don't find in your local cache then
you have to go to the manager node in
order to get a copy of the file so this
is where the manager map data structure
which is a replicated data structure is
available in the memory of every client
and so given the index number and the
offset I can go and look up the manager
map data structure and that tells me who
is a manager that I have to contact to
get this particular file so this might
involve a network hop because of the
manager node is different from the local
node then I have to go to the manager
note across the network and when i get
to the manager node the manager of node
may say oh you know what this particular
file has been accessed by a different
client i know that because my metadata
says that some of the client has got
this in their cash so the manager will
tell the client that
currently is holding a copy of the file
in its cache to please send the data
over to the first guy that requested it
now the data that I requested is coming
not from my local cache but it is coming
from the cache of appear and that's much
better than going to the disk and
pulling it out of the disk because
network speeds are much faster than
accessing the disk so this is a second
best path for file access sure there
isn't it for communication involved here
because the first thing that I have to
do is I have to hop over the network
forget to the manager note if in fact I
am NOT the manager node myself for this
particular file that I'm looking for
there is a network hub and there could
be another network hub if the manager
says oh this particular file is cached
in a different note in that case there
is another network hop to go over to the
client that currently containing that
particular file and once we get to that
there may be another network hop in
order to send the data over to the first
requester so potentially there could be
three Network hops in order to get the
file that I'm looking for but it could
be less than that depending on the
collocation of the manager and the node
that is requesting it or the manager and
the node that contains a copy of that
file itself so this is the second best
path for file access but there is also
the pathologically real long way of
accessing a particular file and that
path is shown here using all of the data
structures that I mentioned earlier that
is available at the manager you started
with the file name look up the directory
get the index number in the offset it's
not in your cash you go to the manager
by looking up the manager map data
structure that's in my local memory I go
to the manager and the manager then
looks up its metadata for this file
finds that nobody has it in their cash
so it has to pull it from the disk if it
has to pull it from the disk then it has
to look up its I map data structure the
I map data structure and the stripe
group map
data structure in order to find out the
location of the inode that corresponds
to the log segment that I am looking for
that look up happens through this I map
data structure stripe group map data
structure then I can go to the storage
server and get the index node of the log
segment ID for the requested data block
of this client once I have that then the
manager has to look up the stripe group
map to say what storage servers have
this log segment striped and out of that
which storage server should I contact
for the particular portion of the file
that you're looking for and that storage
server will be contacted and that
storage server is going to give the data
block that is requested by the client so
you can see that in this long path there
is network hub as well as accessing the
storage servers to pull the data blocks
it is possible that the index node for
the log segment ID associated with this
file has been previously accessed by
this manager in which case it doesn't
have to go to the storage server to get
the index node for the log segment
because it will be present in the memory
of the manager as part of its caching
strategy and therefore it can bypass
these two network hubs because directly
from this tribe group map it can figure
out what the log segment ID is locally
cached so that it can then go to this
stripe group map data structure and
figure out where on the disk the data
blocks for that log segment is actually
stored so we might be able to get rid of
at least two of these network hubs if
you are lucky and this particular log
segment has been accessed before by this
manager it will be in the memory of the
manager and therefore we can avoid these
two network cups but the worst case
scenario if this particular log segment
has never been accessed before then the
long way to get to the data block that
you're requesting is going through the
data structures and the manager
a network hub storage look up and get
the data and give it to the client</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
