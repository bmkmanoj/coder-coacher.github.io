founder and chief executive of human API
Andre is my favorite kind of person an
entrepreneur trained in political
science at the University of British
Columbia he's now starting his second
technology company thanks so much for
having me so a human API is is the
luster of a lot of a lot of the things
we've talked about so far in the course
I'm very excited to have you here
because I think it brings together many
pieces in a tangible way that's easy to
understand and easy to demonstrate so
let's let's start by talking about the
fundamentals of what you do and for that
we've assembled a few toys here rights
opens so I'm a patient and this device
is measuring my my blood pressure or my
activity or right or whatever tell me
tell me what you can do for me starting
at that device and and so the idea for
us really was we wanted to make it
really simple for this data to flow from
this device into wherever it needed to
go whether that was for research for a
doctor you know for a nurse practitioner
you name it and so what what this device
would have and sort of the other really
important part of the system is
somewhere over here in a totally
different part is you have a say
personal health record system and it's
floating away from me but let's just use
this for the time being so you start
with this and what we said is ok this
device will now already has a connection
to a phone of some kind right so let's
put it out there great and then
somewhere along the way it finds its way
into a cloud system of some kind right
so now you've got blood pressure data
that's flowing from this device to the
phone into this cloud system and then
over here you've got and typically this
plaid system would be provided by the
company that provides the device that's
right that's the norm that's right and
so now but now you're over here and
you're talking to your doctor and you're
trying to say okay I've collected all
this blood pressure data and I'd like to
actually get it into the system how do I
do that and so that's where we come in
so what we provide is you you
essentially and i'll show you how this
works a little later on but you
essentially would click a button
inside of this personal health record
system you know just like you were
logging into an appt with Facebook and
what would that happen is we would say
look we're going to grab your data from
this blood pressure device we being
human API we're going to pull it into
our backend we're going to structure and
normalize it and then we will send it on
to their and so I'll show you how that
works but essentially we now sit right
in the middle here this is us and so now
the data is flowing from this device
through the phone up to the cloud
service to us and to the personal health
record of course it wouldn't just be
data from this device it could be data
from several devices of course could be
data the patient is recorded in their
PHR right could be any health data
really is assembled into this patient
control database that's right so now for
example let's say you have a different
device over here and then you know
you're trying to query data from that
and same sort of tree tree like
structure that would flow down from
there and now here's where it gets
really interesting so now that we have
the central identity and that you can
query through an API you know as long as
the patient grants access let's say
you're using a totally different
personal health record system right so
you've got some other application over
here we've already got your data here so
now all you need to do is go inside of
the system click our button and the
connection is made and now anytime you
capture blood pressure on this device it
will automatically flow up the chain and
into all these different systems so
that's what human API does the from the
point of view the course maybe the more
interesting story is how you do it so
for that we're going to clear the table
and let's take a look so I guess this is
a PHR or some other tool that the
patient might be using right exactly so
so for example we mentioned that connect
button that allows you to pull data from
all these different devices so what
we've actually done here is we you know
this would be some sort of personal
health record system and somewhere
inside of here you'd have this connect
your health data button and now what you
do when you click that button is we we
serve up this this pop up that basically
says look this wellness portal or PHR
system wants permission to access your
health data and
and we're going to pull it through human
API now this is really important because
central to our philosophy and how we
approach this business is to put the
patient in the driver's seat in this
case and so what ends up happening is
the patient grants access to the system
and now what's happening on the back end
here is we are we've created an identity
for that patient in our system and we're
essentially saying okay look now we have
all of these different sources so for
this example you know Fitbit jawbone
Nike and moves but it could be any any
one of these right and so we might say
okay let's let's go ahead and
authenticate a Fitbit or let's go ahead
and authenticate you know a moves
application against human API and so
this allows us to connect each of those
different data sources and it could be a
blood pressure monitor it could be
another PHR system you know you name it
is p so moves is a app that keeps track
of right activity that's right and
Fitbit is another approach to keeping
track of people's like right it's
through a device that's right using the
phone one using advice and so that's
that's actually a really really
important point as well because what we
do on our end and that also sort of
helps move this process along for from
the from the perspective of the
application that's pulling in our data
is we actually normalize this data and
so if you think about having you know
steps for example as a metric that's
being recorded maybe by an app on your
phone you know maybe up by a pedometer
you wear maybe by a SmartWatch that has
an accelerometer in it all of the data
from the perspective of the application
is actually just steps and so what we do
on our end is is we structure normalize
that data before we send it on to the
application which makes it much easier
for them to this is a really key point
all right as everyone taking the course
knows interoperability is one of the
overriding challenges and health
informatics and you you sit in the
middle and don't just aggregate the data
but you put it into a standard right
syntax so that it's much easier on the
other side to access the data as we'll
see right so yeah why don't I why don't
I show you kind of how that works so i
will go to here and i will show you you
you saw that authentication process sort
of happened on the
back end right so once once that
authentication process has happened the
data starts flowing from human API so
from the device to human API and into
these various systems right now what
does this actually look like well if you
have and you know for to kind of geek
out a little bit here but we we
basically give an access token for a
user to the application so in this case
we're using the demo access token but
each user of the application would have
their own unique token and then it's a
restful api that we can query in so we
say look api diamond api co human blood
pressure and here you can see structured
data you know systolic and diastolic
blood pressure that's come off of a
Withings blood pressure monitor and then
here's another sort of very you know
what one thing you can do here is
actually change the date range for
example you can sort of modify this
query on the fly so if you're you know
if you're building an experience for a
physician that wants to look at this
data at some point you you as an
application developer can choose how you
interpret this data for that physician
once it's in your system if for example
you wanted to actually visualize it we
can do that on the fly as well so rather
than using the API to human a pio
endpoint you would just use chart and
there it is and if you wanted to you
know change the dimensions of this or
you know do any of that stuff you can do
that on the fly as well so it's
important to look at the URI here the
RESTful API and see how simple it is and
in fact it's essentially human readable
so right getting to this data becomes
much much simpler and there's only a
reference here to blood pressure and the
the app developer or the the querying
the source that screen the data doesn't
have to know what device is being used
doesn't have to know everything about
that device doesn't have to understand
their data streams or formats or sin
taxes they're going to get it in the
standard form through your your system
exactly so what we do is we we abstract
all of that away so if you actually look
at at our back end here you'll see we
have this tool we call the API Explorer
and what you can essentially do and here
as you can see all you know all of the
different types of
that you can query so blood glucose you
know blood pressure levels BMI and so
really important to this this this idea
of normalization is we're not actually
taking Withings data for example and
just passing it on to the developers
what we're actually doing is is making
sure that the data is very clean and
very structured and that enables the
application developer to really focus on
the experience that they want to create
without worrying about where the data
comes from and all of that stuff well
this is great this is an example I think
of the future of interoperability so I'm
glad that we're able to show the
students tomorrow today I think we're
coming to thank you so much for having
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
