ABC's in the natural environment in the
first example she talked about thirst
thirst was our motivation the
refrigerator was our cue or
discriminated stimulus and the behavior
was grabbing a soda and taking a drink
and then we said the thirst is quenched
but let me ask you this are we adding
refreshment or are we removing thirst in
the second example Lawrence says that we
spit out the milk because it tasted bad
so here did we add an unpleasant taste
or do we remove a bad taste these are
two good examples to demonstrate that
sometimes it's difficult to distinguish
whether something is being added to the
environment or remove from the
environment but just remember if
behavior increases it is reinforcement
and if behavior decreases its punishment
we also want you to know that some
people in the field argue about whether
or not we even need the distinction of
positive and negative punishment or
positive and negative reinforcement and
it is difficult to tell for example if
you're cold and you put a sweater on are
you adding warmth or you're decreasing
cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
