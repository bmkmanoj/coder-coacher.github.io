lesson let's take a quick recap before
we move on to the last exercise we
covered what area does to the
accessibility tree essentially Aria
allows you to intervene and do some tree
surgery before the accessibility tree is
exposed to assistive technology from
changing the role name or properties of
a single element through to actually
removing or moving parts of the tree
around we talked about how to use the
role attribute to modify the role of a
single element we saw how to use the
Aria spec to find information about
roles and attributes for example we can
use the Aria spec to find a specific
role then dive down into the detailed
information for that role to learn about
what attributes it supports and what
default semantics it may have similarly
we can find information about particular
re properties we learned how to use
areas extended labeling options Aria
label to provide a screen reader only
label string Aria labeled by to refer to
some visible element as a label and Aria
described by to provide some extra
information alongside the label we
looked at the way Aria can specify
semantic relationships beyond Billy will
by and described by relationships such
as Aria owns to modify the shape of the
accessibility tree we examine the
default semantics of native HTML
elements and saw that some of those
semantics may not be overridden with
aria we learned that Aria has a set of
landmark and document structure roles to
help users navigate and understand page
structure we looked at how to hide
things from assistive technology or show
things only to assistive technology and
lastly we spend some time exploring aria
live regions this is really only the
very basics of Aria but it should be
enough to help you understand what aria
can offer and how to read and understand
the Aria documentation to learn more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
