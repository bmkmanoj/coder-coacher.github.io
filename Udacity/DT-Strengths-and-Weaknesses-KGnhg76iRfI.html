third machine learning algorithm
decision trees you cut all the way to
the end we've learned a lot about
decision trees let's add some of this
newfound knowledge to our list of things
to consider when you're picking a
classifier so they're really easy to use
and they are beautiful to grow and
they're graphically in some sense allow
you to interpret the data really value
can we understand them much better than
sedative as out of a support vector
machine but they also have limitations
that's right
one of the things that's true about
decision trees is they're prone to
overfitting especially if you have data
that has lots and lots of features and a
complicated decision tree it can over
fit to the data so you have to be
careful with the parameter Tunes that
you're picking when you use a decision
tree I meant this from happening but
comes up could look crazy if you know it
has only did single data point you're
almost always over fit so it's very
important for you to measure how well
you're doing and stop the growth of the
tree at the appropriate time one of the
things that's also really cool about
decision trees though is that you can
build bigger classifiers out of decision
trees in something called ensemble
methods in the next lesson we'll give
you a chance to actually explore an
algorithm completely on your own a
couple of the ones that will give you as
choices are examples of ensemble methods
so if this sounds interesting to you
building a classifier out of classifier
then stay tuned in the next lesson it
will be a super-duper machinery research
AACC with us so stay tuned let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
