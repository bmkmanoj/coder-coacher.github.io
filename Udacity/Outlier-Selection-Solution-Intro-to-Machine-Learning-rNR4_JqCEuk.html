probably an outlier at this data point
over here it seems to be really far away
from the other axis
this one isn't it's nonlinear but it
seems the data is very very consistent
with here I'd say we do have an outlier
because this data point over here is far
away this fun is interesting and Katy I
debated it you might call it an outlier
or not I did and since I drew this video
I get to choose
she didn't I would say it's not our
lightest in space but also in class
labels but it could also be just a
single example of a different class
that's not an outlier so that's unclear
this one to me looks more clear the data
point further away and the single data
points called as outliers kind of I
don't know crazy so I would never call
this thing here on outlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
