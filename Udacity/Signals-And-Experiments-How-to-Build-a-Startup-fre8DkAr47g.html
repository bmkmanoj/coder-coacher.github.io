pass/fail signals and experiments so as
you get out of the building and start
talking to these potential customers you
need to set up some experiments how do I
know these are the right customers or
the right buyers and so you want to set
up a series of experiments to test
interest and figure out where do you
want to test it and what kind of
experiments can you run and how many do
you test by the way the how many is a
classic question and the answer is it
depends in a business to business
enterprise sale you might get away with
you know talking to less than 20
customers and that's a great number but
if you have an mobile or web app you
want to talk to hundreds if not
thousands of customers now obviously you
can't personally interview all those
like you could in the enterprise and so
you want to get out and reach them
virtually but the number you want to get
to really is an order of magnitude or
two different than if you were doing b2b
direct sales just a caveat and a warning
when you're out of the building trying
to talk to hundreds or thousands of
potential web or mobile app users you
want to be careful that you're not
completely dependent on online service
people simply lie on surveys and so what
you want to have is some sample where
you actually bring those people into
your building or you go see them and you
watch their pupils dilate as you
actually ask them the question and see
if that kind of diverges from the data
you're getting when they are hitting
your website or you're sending them a
questionnaires and then you'll have a
correlation to be able to figure out is
that data valid or not so just keep that
in mind when you're trying to reach
hundreds or thousands of people for
customer discovery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
