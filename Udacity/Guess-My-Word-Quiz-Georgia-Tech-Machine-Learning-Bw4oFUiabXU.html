using this hill climbing approach that
we've just been talking about and
unfortunately well we tried this with
actual words and the space is a little
bit big and frustrating but what we can
do instead is pretend that a five bit
sequence is a word
so I'm thinking of a word and by word I
mean five bits and what we're gonna do
is I'm gonna give you four each time you
guess a five bit sequence I'm gonna tell
you the number of correct bits so in
each position it's it's if you matched
what I have I'm thinking up in that
position then I give you an additional
point for that okay and you're gonna now
step through the hill climbing algorithm
okay
so three things one if you had done
eight bits that would be a word and oh
nice - four bits is a nibble okay here's
the third thing we need to define a
neighbor function so I'm gonna define a
neighbor function so that I can think
about this is all one bit differences
from where you are that's good and and
an interesting question is was it your
job to come up with that or was it my
job to come up with that now is it part
of the problem or is it part of the
algorithm it's trying to solve the
problem huh I'm gonna say it's a part of
the algorithm just trying to solve the
problem that's how I think of it - all
right so we have to start somewhere so
let's just pretend for the sake of
argument we started at all five zeros
and I'm gonna give you a score of two
for that okay and so now I have to do
all possible neighbors and there are
five of them so there is one followed by
four zeros zero one followed by three
zeros and you know the rest of the
identity matrix all right here's all
your neighbors for the X where you were
and here's the scores for all of those
neighbors so there are three of them
that are maximal but for the sake of
simplicity and drawing I'm gonna stick
with the first one so you can get rid of
the bottom four all right so here's our
new X okay and now I have to try all
different so one of the neighbors would
be all zeros but I already know what
that is so I have to worry about that
that's good so the algorithm the
pseudocode that we wrote didn't didn't
do that optimization but in general that
as long as the neighborhood function is
symmetric then you can save yourself a
little bit of effort right so or we
could just keep track of everything I've
ever seen although that could
very space inefficient very quickly this
is it's the identity matrix concatenated
prepended with the one matrix okay so
what are the numbers for that one
Wow that's pretty cool so this way we're
getting there very quickly
so it's gonna be so the fact do we now
have enough information that a smart
human being could actually jump to the
optimum yeah I think we do I was
actually thinking about that let's see
what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
