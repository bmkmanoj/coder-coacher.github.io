the practical implementation details of
active networks let's talk about the
pros and cons the pros something that
we've been stressing all along and that
is the flexibility from the point of
view of an application perspective the
fact that you can ignore the physical
layout of the network and slap on your
own virtualization of what you want to
accomplish for your network flow on top
of the physical infrastructure is the
key selling point for active networks
but this selling point comes at the cost
of perhaps certain cons what are all the
cons well one concern could be
protection threats what I mean by that
is that the routing infrastructure is
carrying Network flows not only mine but
yours and the third person and so on and
so forth and just like in an operating
system when we have a process we want to
make sure that that process is not doing
anything malicious to other processes
from the same node same way my network
flow should not do anything that is
detrimental to your network flow on the
Internet so that's what we mean by
protection threats so there are some
safeguards in the ants toolkit to
address this protection threats the
first is the runtime safety of ants
program that is running on a router node
and the way they ensure that is by first
of all implementing ants itself in Java
and using Java sandboxing technique on
the router node so that anything that a
router code is doing for capsule
processing is limited to the Java
sandbox that is executing in and so it
cannot affect the flows of other network
flows that are flowing through the same
routing fabric that's the first thing
the second protection thread is whether
there could be quote spoofing that can
happen we are talking about code being
injected into the router and of course
there was a good reason for doing that
that wanted a certain behavior to be
observed by the network routers in
response to packets flowing through the
network that belongs to me but I want to
be sure that the code that is being
executed is the code that I wrote not
malicious code that has been spoofed to
that node well here it here the
safeguard is making sure that you have a
robust robust fingerprint associated
with the code and so what you do is you
generate a type field for the capsule
that is a cryptographically strong
fingerprint of the original code and
you're always matching when you get the
code from a previous node in response to
your request you're going to compute the
fingerprint once more check it against
the fingerprint that is containing the
capsule ensure that there is no code
spoofing happening that's how you can
overcome this protection thread and the
third concern can be integrity of the
soft state and what I mean by that is
the soft store that's available at a
router node is limited in size and you
don't want any particular network flow
to arbitrarily consume all of the soft
State and here again there is a
restricted API that is provided in ants
that's the safeguard for this protection
threat so these protection threads are
concerns but at least in the ants
toolkit they offer solutions to ensure
that these protection threats are not
showstoppers for active networks the
second concern that one might have is
resource management threats now what I
mean by that is because we are executing
code at a router the result of that code
execution could be that I proliferate
packets in the Internet I gave you the
example of me sending a message to my
siblings I sent one message and at some
point that one message becomes end
message so in some sense we can start
flooding the network with capsule
processing is that a threat well it is
but Internet is already susceptible to
this kind of resource management threat
and yes capsule adds to it but it is not
anything new that it is adding in terms
of resource management threat on the
other hand we can ask the question at
each node is it good to consume more
resources than it should and this again
comes back to the safeguard that they
have in
the ants toolkit that the API is a
restricted API and therefore the amount
of resources that you can consume at a
node is fairly restricted so there is
sort of a mixed answer to this resource
management concern at a given node the
resource management concern it doesn't
quite exist so long as you adhere to
this restricted API of ants and the
second concern that the capsules may
flood the network can happen but it
already happens we all experience spam
on the Internet so this is not adding
any new problem but it is perhaps
excessive aiding an existing problem so
having looked at the vision and the
practicality of active networks time for
a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
