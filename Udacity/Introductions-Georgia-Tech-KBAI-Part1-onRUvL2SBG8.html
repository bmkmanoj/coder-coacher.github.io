professor of computer science and
cognitive science of Georgia Tech I've
been teaching knowledge-based AI for
about 25 years I've been doing research
in this area for about 30 my personal
passion is for computational creativity
building air agents the human-like and
creative in their own right I'm a course
developer with Udacity and I'm also
finishing up my own PhD dissertation

advisor my personal passion is for
education and especially for using
modern technology to deliver
individualized personal educational

teach this course we have a lot of fun
putting this course together we hope you
enjoy it as well we think of this course
as an experiment as well we want to
understand how students learn in online
classrooms so if you only feedback
