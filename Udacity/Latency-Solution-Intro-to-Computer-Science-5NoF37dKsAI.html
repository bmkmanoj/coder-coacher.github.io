the first one is correct that would
reduce latency because every time you go
through a hot well there's some time
delay there that you need the time for
the troops at the hop to see the message
that came in and then to start their
fire to send the same message on to the
next top so if you have fewer hops it's
going to take less time for the message
to get across you could routes to the
time it takes to go through each hop so
if you could make the soldiers at each
node work faster it would take less time
from the time that they see the message
to the time that they send it on which
is the time when the next person will
see it so the total time to get across
the network would also be reduced the
third choice does not reduce latency so
adding colors would allow you to send
more messages but it doesn't reduce the
time it takes for a message to get
across and we'll see next that what
adding colors would do would actually
increase the bandwidth of the network
but it doesn't improve the latency at
all and finally because you can do
things that most people can't other than
possibly physicists in Switzerland if
you could increase the speed of light
well that would make the network faster
not a very realistic option and it
wouldn't make it much faster because of
the transit time even with the regular
speed of light the time it takes for the
light to travel between the points is
infinitesimally small compared to the
time for all the other things like
starting fires but all three of these
would in theory reduce the latency the
adding colors would not reduce the
latency but it would increase the amount
of information that you could stand
between those points and the same amount
of time and that's what we call
bandwidth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
