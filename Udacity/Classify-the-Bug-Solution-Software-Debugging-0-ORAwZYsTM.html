which is repeatable under a well-defined
set of conditions well if you include a
debugger in the conditions it could be a
bore bug that normally we don't do that
Heisenberg's change as the program is
being observed and therefore this is a
perfect instance of a Heisenberg mondal
bugs have very complex causes not the
case over here and ensuring bug appears
as soon as somebody looks at this
program and it promptly stops working
not the case over here I would love to
see a student bug in practice it's a
very interesting theoretical concept so
how does this bug come to be what we
have here is a sea speciality this is an
uninitialized variable when in a sea
program we read an uninitialized
variable as in here then the behavior of
the program is undefined according to
the semantics of C and also C++ for the
letter and since the behavior is
undefined while crushing was a perfect
option when executed normally X would
simply take whatever random value was on
the stack and therefore the assertion
would fail however the debugger would
always set the entire stack 20 before
execution and therefore X would take a
zero value and therefore the assertion
would hold you can even have such
distinction between running normally and
being running a debugger on purpose some
malware actively checks if it's being
run in a debugger and then automatically
turns itself off so if you try to
diagnose a malware the malware may be
specifically set up to prevent all sorts
of probing if you suspect a Heisenberg
think what the debugger does differently
than the normal execution and observe
the program execution by at least two
independent means say a debugger and
logging output or two different
debuggers or whatever you have in order
to find out what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
