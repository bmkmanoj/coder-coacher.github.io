we pay about a hundred twenty six
thousand so this is the dot over here I
think you get the story in a scatter
plot each data item becomes a point and
we conveniently chose a two-dimensional
list to make for a two-dimensional
scatter plot these are the most popular
scatter plots because surfaces like
paper are two-dimensional it's really
hard to do it in like 125 dimensions but
beat as it is when they're drawn all the
six data points I get a scatter plot
like this and it's a nice scatter plot
because I can draw a line straight
through all of the data points now when
this happens and there's a relationship
that's governed by a line by a straight
line we call the data linear now
linearity is a rare concept in
statistics very often you find
deviations and that's because the size
of the house is not the only determinant
and the cost or perhaps because most of
us are bad negotiators but when it did a
cell is linear it's really easy to
predict prices of houses in between for
example a house of this size ought to
cost this much so you can read of a
scatterplot the dependence of the size
of a house and its price and here we are
we are actually looking at data we're
doing what a statistician ought to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
