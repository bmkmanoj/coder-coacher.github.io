arguments here are in a way correct so
you could argue that randomization is
more powerful than determinism of course
we don't know why and we don't know if
that is so but it could be a valid
reason that somehow randomization is a
bit more effective but I think you could
argue that randomization is in a way or
that randomization could in a way be a
bit more effective than determinism
after all you're not really saying how
much more effective but maybe you gain a
little edge through trying randomization
of course it could also be that simply
no one has had the right idea yet how to
design a really really good
deterministic algorithm for three set of
course the length of the table that I've
just shown you suggests that people have
put a lot of thought into this but maybe
tomorrow somebody comes up with a really
good idea for a comparable fast
exponential time algorithm for three set
and finally I think this is also an
important point it could be that
analyzing deterministic algorithms it's
just way more complex than analyzing the
randomized one's the three sad algorithm
the randomized one that I've shown you
with a running time of one point three
three four to the power of n times m
polynomial is very very simple and its
analysis is also not that complicated
for the deterministic algorithms however
you have to go through a lot and lot and
lot of analysis to prove those bounds so
it could be that you could modify some
deterministic algorithm to be better
than the randomized one but simply the
analysis required to do so is much more
complex and by analysis I really mean
that you don't really have to modify the
algorithm that much but just look at its
performance a little more closely so
there are a couple of reasons why the
randomized 3sat algorithms could be
better than the deterministic ones but
of course we don't know for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
