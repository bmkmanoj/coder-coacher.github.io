with the data structure yeah so we
wanted to create a word class that has
both translations for the English and
Miwok of the same word oh and this is
like the floor plan or the blueprint
analogy we use from the last course
exactly and so from the same floor plan
we could create many different word
objects okay like this this is a word
object which represents like the number
one and inside the word object we have
two string variables a string variable
for the Miwok translation which is Lutie
and a string variable for the English
translation which is one and because
this word object was created from this
word class it's gonna have these two
methods so they get Miwok translation
method which returns this string and
they get default translation method
which returns this string okay cool that
sounds good all right so from the same
floor plan we can create more and more
word objects so a word for two and a
word for three oh my gosh so many word
objects alright so in the next class
we're going to take a look at how to
write this class definition word all
right if you need help you can refer to
the simplified version of the text view
class that we showed you in the last
course so remember that we need to
provide a constructor for your word
class and the constructor it just looks
like a method declaration but the name
of the method has to match exactly the
name of the class capitalization in at
all so in this case we have the capital
T for text and capital V for view with
no spaces which matches exactly the name
of the class textview also notice that
the constructor has no return type now
looking more closely at the constructor
for the textview class we see it has the
public keyword here and as public
keyword says that an outside class can
access this constructor so for example
an outside caller like the mainactivity
can call this constructor using the new
keyword and pass in this input parameter
to create a new text view object so note
that you can create multiple different
constructors for your class that have
different input parameters that way any
outside caller can create a textview
object in a number of different ways
depending on what input parameters they
can provide now in the next lesson we'll
see firsthand how you can create
multiple constructors for a class
so as mentioned earlier these private
and public words are called access
variables we first learned about this in
the last course
so they define who has access to these
methods or constructors or even this
entire class if a method is marked
private then it can only be called
within the enclosing class so if
something is marked public they it can
be accessed from outside the class so if
the main activity wants to create a new
text object then it can because this
class is marked as public and it also
has a public constructor and if any of
these variables or methods here are
public then the main activity can call
on those as well all right so here's a
diagram from the last course if you
remember if a textview method is marked
as public we can access it from both
within the textview class or from
outside so something like the main
activity could access it in general it's
better to make the variables of the app
so those that control the state of the
object to be private
this way you can expose the public
methods that modify or access these
variables so these methods are called
getter and setter methods and they give
you tighter control over how these
variables are modified or accessed so
for example if these state variables
were marked as public someone could set
it invalid color value on the textview
and this would cause an unexpected
behavior in your class and maybe even
cause your app to crash now on the other
hand if you have a private color
variable with a public center method you
can check that the incoming color is
valid before updating the State now go
ahead and move on to the quiz will
you'll create the word class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
