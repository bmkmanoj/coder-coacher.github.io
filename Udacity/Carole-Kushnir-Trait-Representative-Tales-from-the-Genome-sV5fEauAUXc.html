and I'm here representing being
identified with the bracha to mutation
and i wanna i want to before we get into
the bracket in mutation i want to know a
little bit more about you i mean you
live in California now where were you
from originally well i was born in new
york raised in new jersey and went to
college in New York and got married out
east and we moved to California in the
late 70s okay wow so you've been in
California for a while now right and
would you what do you do for fun what do
you what are you doing California well
I'm do Pilates I bike I hike and I'm
very interested in genealogy and family
history and do you know much about your
family's background and where your
family's from well I know a bad up to as
far as my grandparents Eastern Europeans
and I've also worked on my
daughter-in-law is family and they go
back to the Mayflower oh wow wow you
were able to trace back that far right
well that that's pretty cool and have
you ever visited do you feel a special
connection with family history of you
visited Eastern Europe and is that
meaningful to you well actually it's on
my list their places to go we've been
we've traveled a lot but we haven't been
to Eastern Europe I say well let's come
back to this bracket to mutation tight
can you tell us a little bit more what
what is the bracketry mutation that you
have and what does it mean well I have
the one mutation asst that was tested
and reported is 617 for Del T and it is
a pretty common mutation in Ashkenazi
Jewish people and an uncle of mine is
also has the same mutation and my cousin
his daughter
see so this appears to be a familial
mutation that seems to be an other
family members right it is a familial
mutation but as I mentioned it is common
in Ashkenazi Jewish background and what
is having this mutation mean well
actually maybe we should ask this in
order when did you find out you had the
mutation I found out in early 2010 and
it was a surprise I did the 23andme
genetic testing and the results came
back and it was surprising and what did
they tell you it means what like when
you have this mutation what does it mean
what is for you for an individual well
the risk of breast cancer is increased
compared to the general population and
the risk of ovarian cancer is increased
do you know what those increased risk
were what those percentages were well
for the breast cancer risk it's between
twenty and fifty percent risk although I
saw a higher number earlier when I
looked recently it seems like the risk
the number i saw changed and for ovarian
cancer the risk is much lower but the
risk is higher than in the general
population you can also calculate the
risk based on age so compared to the
general population the risk for breast
cancer at my age of 70 is about 4.5 out
of 100 compared to about 2.5 out of 104
not a woman at age 70 who does not have
the bracha mutation I see and what did
you think about this whole sort of
probability issue you know the idea of a
percentage I mean I think a lot of
people think genetics is going to tell
them oh I am or I'm not going to have
this trait what was running through your
mind a lot I am am married to a
physicist who understands statistics and
he must have explained this to me half a
dozen times now I could focus on was the
high number but of course as you get
older the risk it changes it varies
assuming that there are a hundred people
100 women with the bracha mutation and
50 of already 50 out of 100 have already
had breast cancer then the statistics
change and I can't really explain it but
it is daunting to think that there's you
know double the risk of someone else my
age even if it is a low number sure I
mean I can imagine I sounds like you
discovered that okay there's a lot of
math and there's a lot of research
behind those numbers but the numbers are
still the numbers and I imagine you know
it has sort of an anxiety effect on on
an individual GT feel anxious or worried
and what did you end up doing did you
did it change anything for you and did
you take an action well I was very
anxious and I called my doctor he was
away I called another doctor and he was
away and I called a friend who works at
one of the local hospitals and I said
this is the situation what do you
recommend i do and she gave me the name
of a doctor and it was confirmed by the
time i had that information it was
confirmed by the doctor who had returned
so i went to see a breast oncologist and
at a very large medical center
at the same time she scheduled me to see
a genetic counselor which is recommended
when when you get this information it's
recommended that you speak to someone
and see someone who understands the
genetics so I did see this person and
the physician and the genetic counselor
on the same day and she was gave me a
very thorough exam and a very thorough
explanation there was no rush and I was
advised to consider strongly having my
ovaries removed and to have twice a year
breast exam and one time a year a breast
MRI and a breast mammogram and I've
followed up I've already followed up two
times I see her twice a year and I've
had the MRI and breast exam twice wow
you took a lot of action okay and this
was all based on the advice and the the
i should say the medical advice of a
genetic counselor and your clinician
right right and the genetic counselor
took a history of everyone in the family
mother mothers fathers grandfathers and
it was interesting to to find out my
grant my maternal grandmother died when
my mother was five so we're talking
about the 1920s and my I was always told
my grandmother died of stomach cancer
and the genetic counselor brought up the
possibility that she had had ovarian
cancer of course we wouldn't know and
this was the 1920s and that was what we
we heard that she died of stomach cancer
but it could have been ovarian cancer
Wow what um what did this affect have on
your
anxiety about the information about your
sort of medical future oh it made me
very anxious but I keep busy I work so
it's it's something that's in the back
of my mind it's not invisible but I took
action I had my ovaries removed then it
was a pretty simple procedure everything
they completely analyzed all the slides
and everything was clear so for that I
am grateful and I'm following up on the
mammograms and exams and so far it's all
good news so far so good I'm glad to
hear that um in this process was it was
it just a personal decision for you or
did you include family members and
discussing it and trying to figure out
what to do as well well I'll be married
50 years in graduations 2014 I'm very
close with my husband and he and I
discussed this and it just seemed like
it was the right thing to do of course I
read a lot and I had family members who
had breast cancer and ovarian cancer and
none of them were bracha to or any
bracha for that matter so it wasn't as
if I knew anybody that had this was in
this situation do you even can you tell
us but it sounds like you you did a lot
of reading and researching yourself
trying to learn about it do you know
what the the bracket genes do and a cell
or in the body well if you had you have
a bracha gene and if you have a normal
gene which regulates the how the non
cancerous cells would be working then
you wouldn't be subject to the risk
breast cancer ovarian cancer based on
just that bracha gene however if you
have the mutation there's as far as I
understand it there's in my particular
case I'm missing the teeth and the whole
gene shifts the the bracha gene is
shifting and there's a mutation and so
it's not operating correctly as is my
best understanding that's a pretty good
understanding um however the mutation
and the resulting protein that doesn't
work so well it doesn't seem to lead to
completely breast cancer ovarian cancer
and all people who have it as you
mentioned what are some of the
environmental things that i did a
clinician or genetic counselor talk to
you about the environmental components
that may play a part in this well I was
asked how much alcohol I drink and I
said well I live in California you know
I often have a glass of wine with dinner
and so it's they don't know it's not for
certain but they're recommending not
drinking too much alcohol and as far as
the environment goes there was really
nothing much to that they discussed but
we eat healthy and I moderate my wine
drinking it sounds like you lead a
pretty healthy lifestyle and so that's
good um I'm actually curious I'm curious
to know sort of there's this sort of
personal feeling and an idea of you know
when you find out did anyone in your
family have anxiety for you as well or
did where other family members concerned
and did they interpret it the same way
you did they only listen to you for
information did they look in other
places well a lot of people in my family
took the 23 Emmy test our sons are two
sons my husband
because his mother had breast cancer he
took the test our daughter-in-laws took
the test we asked an uncle my paternal
uncle to take the test and he was Brock
or two and his daughter took the test
and she's brockington so one of our sons
is Brock or two so they all my sister
took the test and she was negative
forgot about my sister and another
cousin on my mother's side took the test
and she was negative also but she found
out she had some hearing loss a gene
that affected hearing could affect
hearing she isn't affected but her
grandson she found it because of that
they identified that the grandson who
had some hearing issues had the same
mutation so everybody was supportive and
understanding but I'm pretty open person
so they just took it and they took my
lead you mentioned that one of your
son's has the bracket too but the other
son does not right it's great that you
were able to be sort of an example and a
leader for your family and sort of how
to tackle information like this did
anyone else was in general as everyone
else's reaction the same you mentioned
that you have female relatives you may
be younger than you who also have the
mutation did they well my one cousin is
in the process right now of scheduling
an appointment for surgical removal of
her ovaries Oh for ectomy I see so it
sounds like you know there's everyone
sort of going to talk to their doctor
and make these decisions about what's
the best action to take those and she
saw a genetic counselor as well so I'm
also curious to know what else you found
out from your genetic report you said
you went to 23andme and
was was the bracket to mutation the only
surprise you found well I found out that
had a low risk for Alzheimer's disease
but I'm not so sure that was accurate I
also found out that I have the taste ax
mutation and tay sachs is another
Ashkenazi Jewish genetic mutation and
since I am not having any children and
my husband wasn't the carrier then I
didn't really worry about it but I was
surprised if you have a pregnancy and
your baby's identified as having
tay-sachs the result of a sax baby is
they die within a couple of years of
birth and it's a lipid storage disease
where the baby is missing an enzyme that
metabolizes a lipid and this lipid norm
is normally metabolized but when you
have the mutation or when you have teh
secks disease the lipid accumulates in
the brain and the baby dies Wow so
although you knew about your your
ancestry and you knew your you know part
of this Ashkenazi Jewish population and
or lineage and um and you know there
were maybe certain certain variants that
you may carry you didn't know which ones
and this was you know news to you to be
a rains right in us do you know if your
sons are also carriers I don't remember
it was more the bracha tube i also have
go Shay's disease and that's another
lipid storage disease and Ashkenazi Jews
but not limited toshka
say cheese and that's they're both
carriers because I have the disease you
mentioned your carrier of tay-sachs and
you don't not sure if your son's have
the mutation as well and they could be
carriers you would it affect if you
hadn't had kids yet and you were
planning your life would is this
something that would be important to you
and making sure before you know you had
children with a particular mate making
sure that person was not a carrier of
tay-sachs as well well with the
information we have today I certainly
would inquire and have my husband tested
and take action if there I would want to
make sure that we were tested and if I
were to get pregnant I'd want to know if
the baby I was carrying had teh sex or
not you said your sons are carriers and
have your son's have they had any
biological children yet um yes they each
have two sons each have two sons right
one sinus does not have proper to
mutation which one son does and they
both have two sons I see so this I was
just wondering if there's any anxiety I
mean the fact that you were carrier and
one son is a carrier for the bracket to
mutation I guess it manifests more in
females than males right but there is a
risk for male breast cancer and and they
believe there may be a linked to
prostate cancer and the they don't seem
the one son just seems to be taking it
in stride and not focusing on it right
now you know there are a lot of people
in the general population who some who
don't know very much about genetics and
as this information becomes more
widespread and may discover like you
that they have a bracket 2 or bracket
one mutation females in particular who
don't
very much if you add any advice to tell
somebody who just found out they have a
bracket 1 or bracket to mutation is
there anything you think it's important
for them to know or any particular
advice or message you would give them
well if someone does inquire and finds
that I certainly think they should get
genetic counseling and see a physician
who is a specialist in breast oncology
who is aware of the latest and greatest
research we're fortunate to live in an
area where there are wonderful hospitals
and research centers and so I strongly
advise people to take action and do
what's best for them I know age is a
factor if you find out you're in your
20s or 30s and you haven't started a
family or had children yet what's
recommended might be entirely different
than what was recommended for me great
Carol thank you so much for being here
