you about the brain and visual function
right now it is a huge area of research
as you can imagine it's it's it's really
fundamental to the human system as I
said somewhere around thirty percent of
our cortex is devoted to this we get
insights from computation and
understanding what the brain does and
sometimes we get insights from brain and
or physiology to thinking about the
computation and it's one of the areas in
which we get some direct connection
between what you might think of as
artificial intelligence and natural
intelligence it's one of the areas that
we've pushed furthest on that there's
also work going on for example in
computational modeling of a lot of
hearing audition right so to understand
what goes on in the human system versus
artificial system and in the other
senses things are just getting started
so haptics how do you go from touch I
can touch an object and I can tell you
about its shape how do I do that how can
I tell that a texture oh that's probably
the skin of an orange right do it's a
computational problem and we'd like to
get insight back and forth so sensation
in general and on robotic side of motor
control is trying to get a computational
model of what goes on in the brain all
right um so that's really all I'm gonna
tell you about the brain it is
fascinating stuff and even in the
popular literature there's a lot of
information getting out there that I
would deeply encourage you to go take a
look and I think you'll enjoy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
