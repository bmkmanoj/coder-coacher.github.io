these are a few of the hottest buzzwords
floating around but what's driving the
hype in the last decade use it a man for
always-on applications have grown
exponentially if you go to your favorite
site you expect no demand it to be up
24/7 globally no exceptions many
developers have chosen application
patterns such as microservices to meet
this need but what about the
infrastructure to support these
always-on apps this course is going to
show you step by step from theory to
production how to meet these demands
using tools that are available today
I'm your host Carter Morgan and like you
I'm new to this world of micro services
and the advanced infrastructures used to
support them so I reached out to my good
friend Kelsey Hightower you may know him
as mr. kubernetes aka
SS admin who can code Kelsey will be
serving as our industry expert giving us
deep insights into the solutions we'll
be covering
additionally we'll be hearing from the
legendary former cloud architect of
Netflix the guy who helped make micro
services mainstream Adrian khakhra and
he'll be sharing his insights on the
evolution of applications in modern day
infrastructure but before we go any
further let's hear from Kelsey on who
this course is for you know Carter this
course is for anyone doing operations
whether your assistant mentor developer
or anyone new to the field looking to
mystify the idea of managing
applications at scale many of you may be
familiar with automation tools such as
puppet chef or ansible we're going to
build on that knowledge and introduce
you to the world of distributed systems
and take your idea of automation to the
next level this will be taught through a
collection of hands-on tasks using
industry standard tooling like docker
and kubernetes by the end of this course
you'll know the ins and outs of the
cloud application lifecycle from
packaging it into a container to
managing into production Kelsey I know a
lot of people are excited about this but
can you give a sneak peek
about what to expect first I'm going to
start with the basics of understanding
modern day applications and how new
design patterns such as microservices
has driven the need for more robust
infrastructure once we have a solid
understanding of an application we'll
shift focus towards how to package and
distribute our apps using the docker
image format and container technologies
then we're really up are getting to
running applications using distributed
platform that allows us to start small
and scale two levels of Internet giant's
such as Google Facebook and Netflix
where do I sign up I don't know about
you but that's exactly what I'm looking
for let's go ahead and get started shall
we
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
