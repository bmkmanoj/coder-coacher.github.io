similar benefits function call in lining
has a similar downside and that downside
is the code bloat suppose we have the
original program and it calls the
function and then it continues and cause
the same function from another place and
so on let's say that our function is 10
instructions and then a return so now
when we do our inlining what we will do
is we will effectively put the 10
instructions here and replace the call
and also take the same instructions put
them here and replace the call so what
used to be 10 instructions plus 1 for
the return plus 2 for calling all
together 13 instructions now becomes 10
instructions here and 10 instructions
here and although we eliminated the
overheads and there are no longer
function calls and returns and possibly
some small amount of argument copying
and so on still we have replicated the
body of the function as many times as
there are places in the coded call it
some functions are called from hundreds
of places which means that the body of
the function will now be replicated many
many times this means that we really
need to be judicious about when do we do
function call in lining we cannot in
line all of the functions that we want
we want to inline functions that are
small because the fewer instructions we
have here the more we are likely to
offset the additional instructions we
put in here by the removal of some of
the overheads but as the function goes
big the replication results in a lot
more code than the original calling and
returning coded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
