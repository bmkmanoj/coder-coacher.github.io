and protecting the operating system from
untrusted process code same exact
mechanism the page table when you're
running in user mode doesn't allow you
to go to any physical pages that belong
to the operating system is really done
through this memory management that we
just talked about the memory management
is is important enough that we actually
hardware wide support for it typically
you have what is called a memory
management unit or mmu that helps you
take those logical or virtual addresses
and resolve those into physical
addresses efficiently I said we had to
read you know go through the page table
well you know then to access memory
location you are to access page table
entry now that adds overhead so the
hardware actually can store some of that
things called T lbs or translation
lookaside buffer is that associative
memory that allows you to do this
mapping fairly efficiently memory
management this translation and
isolation what you can access and all
that is hardware support for it so
there's another interesting thing that
we should be able to think about here so
we have these units we call pages or
frames and we have this table we call a
page table and we say we go through a
very stable entry to see where our
logical page currently lives in physical
memory so that page table entry tells us
where in physical memories but we can
have some other information along with
that we can for example have whether
this page that we're trying to access is
for reading only is it for writing or
it's or execution only in case it
happens to contain instructions or code
so you can actually have this kind of
protection information on these pages in
the page table entry that can limit the
type of memory access you can do so we
said protection sort of now we are
saying there are two parts to it first
part is where in memory a given process
is allowed to go so where can its
logical addresses we translated to in
physical memory but now we are saying
another level of protection is what can
in what manner can it access even if
it's allowed to access a given location
in physical memory is it reading only is
it riding only is it
cution and things like that so the way
we do that is in the page table entries
we keep this information this protection
information about the ways in which
memory can be accessed and that is also
used when you're trying to do let's say
store and the target address is
write-protected you can do that that
instruction would would not be allowed
to go through by the hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
