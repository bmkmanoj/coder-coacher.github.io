why GPUs look the way they do well now
discuss what a GPU looks like from the
point of view of a software developer
one of the themes of this class is the
importance of programming in parallel
this is a crucial skill not just for
GPUs but also for CPUs even if you buy
an 8 core Intel Ivy Ridge processor we
see that it has eight cores each core
has eight wide AVX vector operations
each core supports two simultaneously
running threads multiply those together
and you get 128 way parallelism on this
processor if you run a completely serial
C program with no parallelism at all
you're going to use less than 1% of the
capabilities of this machine there's no
doubt that parallel programming is
harder than serial programming no matter
what your target but I hope by the end
of the class we'll convince you that
this additional complexity is worthwhile
for the potential performance gains and
throughout the course of the class we'll
try to lay out the benefits and the
limitations of this programming model
one of the really exciting things about
GPU computing is that it moves quickly
and some of today's limitations may
disappear in the next generation of GPUs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
