short statements defining and
manipulating data types and data
structures now it's time for control
flow the syntax of telling your program
which statements to execute when for
this module you'll want to be following
along in the playground file entitled L
for control flow let's start with for
loops swift supports traditional C style
for loops like this one note that there
are no parentheses around the condition
if you're used to C style languages you
might miss the parentheses at first but
they'll soon fade from your heart and
you'll realize you're better off without
them see stop for loops might work well
for bar songs but I think you'll really
come to appreciate the efficiency of
swift's fast enumeration with foreign
loops which you got a glimpse of earlier
when we talked about strings for in
loops take the general form for item and
collection and then between curly braces
the statements you want to execute on
each item in the collection to iterate
through this string for example we just
write for character in demo string
characters which is a collection of
characters and then this print statement
will be executed on every item in the
collection in this case every character
in the string it's super convenient and
then here is what it prints to the
console let's see another example let's
find the sum of all the ins in this
array to do that we just type for value
in enter a and this statement adding int
to the sum will be executed for each
member of the collection you can see
here in the playground sidebar that it's
being executed five times and then if we
want to see our sum we can just type sum
and that'll appear in the playground
sidebar as well we can use for in to
iterate through dictionaries as well
here we have a dictionary of movies and
their directors and here's a for loop
that prints out a statement about who
directed each of the movies in movie
dict you can see that the syntax is
similar to iterating through an array in
this case the key value pair is placed
in parentheses after four and then both
key and value can be referred to in the
body of the loop and if we want to see
that output in the console we just go
down to the bottom of
the screen and click on this button that
shows the rectangle with the triangle
inside and here's the output we're
looking for but for the most part we're
going to stick to looking at our results
in the playground sidebar so let's close
the console for now let's do one more
let's try something with the animal
groups dictionary here the plural animal
name is the key and the animal group
name is the value and we can iterate
through each pair to print out a
statement about each group so if we open
up the console again we can see that
many whales form a pod many Lions former
pride many geese form of flock what too
many you Dacians form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
