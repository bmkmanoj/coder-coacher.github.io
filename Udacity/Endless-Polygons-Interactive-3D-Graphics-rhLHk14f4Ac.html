constraint like if it goes less than 30
frames per second and they have to cut
back somehow they have to get rid of
polygons or they have to go beat their
artists to put you know less content in
the scene but since you're selling to
who knows who you know the guy could say
well I want it 50 or oil derricks or you
know 50 whatever's you know in my scene
and so what kind of techniques are used
to sort of control that you know well I
want as much as I want you know some of
those are producing geometric complexity
where if you have it you have a complex
model so as you're starting to orbit
around if it's too slow we can decimate
some triangles from that so again there
are a lot of techniques that are similar
between games and CAD most situations we
tend to let the user have more control
over that we're in then they may care
more about it some customers may be fine
you need to orbit something we can turn
it into a wireframe object because that
will get them to the point they need and
then we go back to the to the full
resolution and lighting is another one
where we can have some effect we can
have to landscape lighter who has a
thousand lights in their scene and you
can't necessarily do that in real time
so sometimes we'll cut out some of the
lights that will have a lesser effect on
the scene so instead of getting one
hundred percent fidelity with the real
world we may only look eighty percent
correct while they're moving around but
then once they stop then we can go back
to from showing the full scene</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
