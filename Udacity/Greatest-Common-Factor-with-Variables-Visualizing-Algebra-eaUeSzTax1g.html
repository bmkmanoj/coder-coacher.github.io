see why this would be the prime
factorization for 45 x squared y cubed
and this would be the prime
factorization for 36 X to the fourth Y
squared Z I'm gonna regroup my numbers
together so that we have the twos
together and the threes together I want
to find the lowest power of each factor
that appears in both terms we know that
three appears in both terms and in fact
a power of three squared
appears in both terms so that's gonna
start the product of my greatest common
factor this number has a 5 however this
number does not so I can't list 5 as
part of my greatest common factor
however X is a factor that appears in
both terms and we have a power of x
squared that is common between them so
we can list x squared and the product of
our GCF and finally they both share the
lowest power of Y squared so we can
include that in our GCF as well the
greatest common factor is the product of
all of these factors together so we have
9 times x squared times y squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
