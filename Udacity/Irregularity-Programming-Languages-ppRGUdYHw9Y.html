parentheses are one of the first things
we've seen that are too complicated to
be captured accurately by our old
dearest friends the regular expressions
we're going to need something like a
context-free grammar to do it so here
I've written a grammar for balanced
parentheses and over here to the right
I've tried to write a regular expression
that catches the same sort of thing and
open parenthesis possibly repeated and
closed parenthesis possibly repeated
remember that these slashes are escape
sequences to say oh I really mean the
open parentheses and I don't really mean
some sort of grouping however it's going
to turn out that the best laid plans
don't quite work out my regular
expression is a bit too permissive and
there are going to be some strings that
it accepts but that the grammar does not
some strings that it accepts that aren't
really balanced parentheses in this
multiple multiple choice quiz I'd like
you to tell me for these five strings
for these five utterances which ones are
in our the regular expression but not in
P the grammar for parentheses think
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
