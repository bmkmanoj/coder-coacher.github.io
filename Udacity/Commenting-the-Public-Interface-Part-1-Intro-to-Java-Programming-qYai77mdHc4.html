learned how to identify the instance
variables of a class how to provide the
methods how to write the Constructors
and the result has been a lot of code
but we've forgotten something very very
important how does one use this code and
who's one that would be the programmer
who doesn't want to know what goes on
inside the core class but who just wants
to write programs that drive cars around
now for a car one would have an owner's
manual but for code what you want is
Java doc let me show you what one needs
to put into the code to get the Java doc
over here you see the same car class
that we've been developing but I've
added documentation comments these
comments are enclosed in these de
limiters you see them over here you see
another set over here at the top of the
class you see a class comment that
describes the purpose of the class at
the top of every constructor and of
every method you see a method comment
for every parameter there is a line
explaining what the parameter means and
for those methods that return a value
there is a comment that explains what
the method returns now previously you
have seen the Java doc comments in a
webpage the way to get such a webpage
for your own classes is to run the Java
doc tool which we can easily do from
within bluejay in the main bluej menu
pick tools then project documentation
and you'll get to see a webpage in the
familiar Java doc format that contains
exactly the same comments there were in
the source file that's what the Java doc
tool does it takes the comments from the
source file and puts them into the web
page for example here you see the
description of a parameter and that's
the exact same description that was
provided in the source code notice that
over here this method looks rather naked
no description no parameter description
that's because there is no javadoc
comment here so it's your turn now go
ahead and put it in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
