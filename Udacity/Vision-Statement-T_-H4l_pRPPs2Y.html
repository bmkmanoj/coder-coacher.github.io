get started writing one for your
business a vision statement is a
declaration of your company objectives
meant to provide guidance on the
decisions you make basically it's the
big dream that you have for your
business you can think of it as the
North Star for your company it helps
provide inspiration about what your
business is focused on achieving
throughout its lifetime there's a few
basic questions that a vision statement
should be able to answer try focusing on
questions like these what will your
business become if everything goes
according to plan why do you exist and
how will your business change the world
you don't want to state specific ways
you go about doing this yet just focus
on the overarching goal that you as a
business plan to work towards and
finally it's important to consider how
long your vision statement might need to
be there's really no set length for a
vision statement but there's a few
guidelines you can follow to help write
yours you want to make sure you have
enough information to provide a sense of
purpose a call to action and an idea of
your final destination you don't want it
to be so long that it's difficult to
understand but making it too short can
also leave out the kind of meaning it
will need to actually guide your
business one-line vision statements are
possible but you could have a full
paragraph if that's what it takes just
consider that if you want people to
actually read and remember this then
brief can be better
don't be so broad that you sound generic
but not so specific that it won't be
relevant after a couple years for
example Google's vision is to provide
access to the world's information in one
click do you notice how their vision
focuses on a bold claim about the
overarching goal they have for their
business try doing the same for yours
so consider some of these ideas and look
into some of the examples of vision
statements created by other companies
once you feel comfortable with the
purpose of a vision statement try
thinking of one that you could use for
your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
