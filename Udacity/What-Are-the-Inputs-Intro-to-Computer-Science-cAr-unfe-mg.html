for any problem is what are the inputs
for this problem they're fairly clearly
stated it says given your birthday and
the current date well that's the input
to the problem what's the set of inputs
we really want this to work for should
it really just work for my birthday and
today's current date if that's all we
wanted to work for well then we can
figure this out once we don't actually
need to write a procedure so I think
what is really intended by this is
something much more general so the
inputs are really two dates and that
gives us the type of input that gives us
a set of all possible inputs we need to
think a little more carefully to know if
they're all valid well the statement of
the question give us a good clue here it
said assume that the birthday and the
current data are correct dates and no
time travel this probably is a valid
assumption if we're talking about
birthdays and current dates if we're
comparing any two dates well this says
that the second date needs to be after
the first one assumptions like this make
life easier for programmers they mean
it's easier to write our code since it
has to work for fewer possible inputs I
like the way Matteo stated this is no
time travel for a program specification
we probably want to be a little more
precise and just state simply the second
date must not be before the first date
and if we're being good defensive
programmers we should check this is true
it's an assumption it's up to the user
of our code to satisfy this because
we've said well that's a requirement to
use our solution you have to make sure
the second date is not before the first
date but if we're gonna be smart we're
gonna program in a more defensive way
because sometimes other people might
make mistakes or we might make mistakes
and we're actually gonna check this in
our code the other assumption we might
want is something about the range of
dates calendars are very complicated and
they've changed over history we're gonna
require that the dates are valid dates
in the Gregorian calendar which started
in October 1582 our code will probably
work for dates outside this range but it
might not get exactly the right answer
since when the calendar changed the
meaning of dates changed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
