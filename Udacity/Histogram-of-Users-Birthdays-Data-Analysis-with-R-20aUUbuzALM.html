using ggplot ggplot is a graphics
package that allows us to make
visualizations we're using ggplot since
it's easier than the base graphics that
comes with our it has some nice features
such as the format of plots and legends
that are automatically generated the
first thing we need to do is to download
and install the ggplot library
now that we've got ggplot loaded let's
use the queue plot function to plot a
histogram showing the number of users
whose birthdays fall on any given day I
can run the names PF command to get an
output of all my variables now I'm
trying to create the date of birth by
day histogram for all my users so I'm
going to use the date of birth day
variable here for the queue plot
function I'll pass it to parameters X
and data X is going to take the variable
data birthday and data is going to take
the variable PF which is where all my
data comes from from the pseudo facebook
data set running this command I see my
histogram come out in the plot window
below now you might notice that this
plot is slightly different in color if
you're curious about setting color in
themes in our see the instructor notes
getting back to our code in console you
can see that we get this warning message
when we ran the code this is fine for
now but you should think about what this
warning message means so here's our
histogram so far but I want to add one
more layer to this plot let's fix the
label on the x-axis so we can see every
day of the month here to adjust the
x-axis I'm going to add a plus sign
right out of my code and then hit return
this immediately takes me down the next
line with a little bit of indentation
right here I'm gonna have the layer
scale X discrete and then give it the
parameter breaks from 1 to 31 this is
because I want all my days to be 1 to 31
the days of the month and running this
code we can see we've done a little bit
better what are some things that you
notice about this histogram</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
