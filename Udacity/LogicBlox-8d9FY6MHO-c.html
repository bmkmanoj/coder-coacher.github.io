what what would our what sorts of things
they sell so logic boxes primary product
is what we call a smart database it's an
active cloud database that has much of
the business logic that one would
normally need to write in a traditional
imperative language running on a
separate machines in down in the
database so that when data are added to
the database these business rules kick
in and update views automatically it
specializes in doing really large-scale
analytics and applications that are kind
of a hybrid between transactional and
and analytic and that's really our sweet
spot and and what's what sort of
customers do you have and the kinds of
products that they need yeah so most of
our customers that are longer term
customers have been customers in the
retail domain that need to do analysis
to decide how many products they should
order you know forgiving promotion or
forecast demand for a given set of
products at their stores or or do
financial planning these tend to be
really large often multi terabyte
applications that that have years and
years of sales history that we use to
try to do a good job of forecasting or
predicting how products will move and we
use our smart database to analyze that
and roll up and roll down those data
very very very efficiently so that the
terabytes is not the size of the source
code plus the amount of data that they
have to deal that's correct yeah the
amount of source code is meant be very
small the idea is that you want to
declare your business rules as concisely
and compactly and as close to the way
you'd want to just save them in English
as you can and then we install those
those business rules into a into our
database which then we load with with
the terabytes of data and you mentioned
in the cloud is this is this what they
call software as a service it is yes so
we sell all of our applications are sold
as a service so our forecast or which I
think we're going to talk about a little
while in particular our forecast manager
is is a service that customers big
retail customers will pay us a monthly
fee assass fee to access and part of our
model is that they can at any time
choose to they don't have to install a
lot of special hardware and have experts
IT expertise in-house they can just
subscribe to our service they access it
through standard web browsers they can
turn it off and on as as they desire if
they decide they don't like it anymore
they can just quit and so it's really
nice for customers part of our business
proposition is that we can quickly get
in to give access to a customer and let
them see the benefits they don't have to
make a lot of upfront commitment to use
our technology and they can decide to
leave anytime so would you call this a
real-time application i wouldn't i'm not
sure it called a real-time application
it is an interactive application in the
sense that there will be users who will
be executing queries and analyzing data
and what they would consider to be real
time so they need fast response time
it's an interactive system it doesn't
have hard real-time deadlines the way
most the way we know when we think about
real-time software be developed and and
how does how does the customers data
their sales data or their product data
get to you yeah it's actually little bit
complicated so customers tend to keep
their data in systems database systems
that they've had for you know 50 years
and that have their own special formats
and they're very difficult to integrate
with what we tend to do is get them to
export data that they need to send to us
and usually in just big CSV files or
some kind of delimited tabular file and
they'll send us these files at various
times we have servers that will receive
the files and put them off to Amazon's
s3 storage which we use to it's a nice
very scalable very reliable storage
system that we use to to keep the
incoming data and from that we load load
them into our databases but but this
this data might be periodically updated
that's correct okay oh no not often our
daily basis and sometimes for some
customers even more frequent than that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
