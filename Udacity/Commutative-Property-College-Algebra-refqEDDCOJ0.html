were multiplied together to create this
term is there a more simplified way for
us to write this thankfully the answer
is yes however before we can start to
play around with this term we need to
learn about something called the
commutative property specifically the
commutative property of multiplication
since all of our factors are multiplied
together here the commutative property
of multiplication basically tells us
that it doesn't matter what order we
multiply things together in so for
example we know that two times three
equals six however we also know that
three times two equals six that means we
know that two times three is just equal
to three times two if we want to talk
about this with variables instead of
with numbers we could talk about let's
say x times e times y here we have three
different variables multiplied together
and we can rearrange these factors in
any order we want and still get a
mathematically equivalent expression so
we could have a ton of different things
maybe Z times X times y that's also
equal to y times X times C or Z times y
times X and so on and so forth all these
expressions and all the other ones that
we could get by rearranging these in
other ways are equal to one another so
remember for a multiplication it doesn't
matter what order you multiply things
together in this holds no matter how
many things you want to multiply
together and it holds whether the
factors are variables or numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
