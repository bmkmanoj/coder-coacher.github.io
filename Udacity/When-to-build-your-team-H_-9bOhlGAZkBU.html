found it's abundantly obvious when you
need to hire somebody so you kind of go
on you have this idea you're working on
it really hard you get some users you
get some traction and the thing that
gives you the most pain is the thing
that you need to hire for and for me it
was always operations and just like
doing deals advertising getting i
mentioned earlier that we're an apple
retail like that was just this this
woman that I hired that just
miraculously made it happen was it was
huge lots of phone calls and meetings
and so the thing about it is you need to
find the people that are going to fill
in your gaps and they become I like to
go until it's painful I've done their
job for a little bit so I know what to
look for and but I hated enough that I
know I need to get somebody else to do
it but I i really recommend I've seeing
entrepreneurs do this where they will
actually just go well I need a BD person
before they've actually felt that pain
like they think this is the play book
they read a book somewhere they heard
from there you know or they read the
story of another company every company
is unique and especially in the early
days and so in your strengths are unique
so what you need to hire first off is
probably not what any other company
needed to hire right off the bat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
