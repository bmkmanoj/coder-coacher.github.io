fixed-size queue data structure that's
going to serve as a running example for
some of this lecture and they're also
going to keep using for a couple of our
exercises for the next several units and
the way this data structure works is it
supports an NQ operation a DQ operation
and NQ elements get DQ'd in FIFO order
where FIFO is first in first out so if
we NQ 7 and then also 8 the first thing
that we DQ will be sitting will be 7
then 8 and if we try to DQ again if we
try to DQ an element from an empty queue
we're going to get some sort of an error
okay so that's our fixed size keywords
now let's look at some code so on the
implementation side what we have here is
a Python object so it's called Q and a
constructor for that object is going to
set up the data structure the
constructor for that object is going to
take a size max argument that's going to
determine the largest number of objects
that can be stored in our queue and it's
going to set up the data structure so
first it's going to make sure that size
max is greater than 0 it's going to save
the temporary copy of that initialize
some head tail and head and tail
pointers a size variable which stores
the number of objects currently in the
queue and finally we need to reserve
some space for the Q elements themselves
what we can see here is we're allocating
a Python array and so one implementation
option for a queue in Python would be
just use a Python list and that would be
basically trivial Python lists already
is pretty much natively support and
queue and EQ operations and the problem
with a Python list is they're
dynamically allocated they're
dynamically typed and that makes them
not very fast and so by allocating a
fixed size storage region of statically
typed memory here the I here means that
our queue is only going to be able to
store integers we can avoid some of
Python dynamic checks that make the
queue slow and so in some cases a queue
based on the Python list is perfectly
fast but on the other head on the other
hand in some benchmarking that I did
this cube here this this statically
sized statically typed queue is more
than 10 times faster than a cube based
on a Python list so the first method
that queue supports is the empty method
and this simply returns true if self dot
size equals 0 so of course the empty
queue is the one that currently contains
0 elements very similarly the full queue
method returns true
if the current size of the queue is
equal to the maximum size of the queue
so now let's look at a couple of
routines that are slightly trickier the
enqueue method is going to take an
argument X X is an integer that we want
to try to add to the queue the first
thing this method is going to do is
check if the current size of the queue
is the maximum size of so the queue is
full and we're going to return false
if we pass this test of course the queue
is not full and we have room so the next
thing we're going to do is put the put
the data item put the argument data item
into the queue at the location pointed
to by the tail and so now let me show
you a little bit of about how our
representation works so for
demonstration purposes we're going to
look at a three element queue and
initially it's going to have a head and
a tail running to the first queue
element that is the queue element with
index 0 and also its size is going to be
0 to n queue in item we first check if
the queue is full here it's not because
the size is 0 we go ahead and put the
item let's say it's the number 7 in the
queue element pointed to by the tail and
then we're going to increment the tail
and now the last thing we have to do to
in queue an element is increase the size
of the queue to be 1 okay now let's go
look back at the code looking at the
code we can see that we put the element
in the queue we increase the size of the
queue we move the tail to point to the
next element and the only thing that's
left the only bit of logic that sort of
tricky here is if the tail of the queue
points past the end of the queue that is
to say if it's equal to the max and so
remember with a 0 indexed array the
maximum is going to be 1 past the end of
the queue we're going to reset the tail
to point at the zeroth element of the
queue that is to say the beginning
now the dequeue operation is very
similar first if the size of the queue
is 0 then the queue is empty we're not
going to be able to DQ an item and so
we're going to what we're going what
we're going to do in this case is return
pythons none type so none none of the
special data type supported by Python
that we can often use to indicate that
we don't have anything so we don't have
any actual value so if we pass that test
then there is something to return and so
what we're going to do is store the item
from the head of the queue in a
temporary variable so X is going to get
7 we're going to decrement the size of
the queue we're going to move the tail
pointer to point to the next element and
then using the logic very similar
to the tail pointer in the NQ function
we're going to wrap the head pointer
around if it's gone past the end of the
queue so let's go back to the drawing
and look how to see how this plays out
so we're going to return seven decrement
the size and make the head element point
to the next element of the list and
we're not going to bother erasing the
seven that we returned but we're gonna
have to make sure that our queue logic
never returns this dead element alright
so let's take a very quick quiz just to
make sure that we understood all that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
