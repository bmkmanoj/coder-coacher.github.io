languages that are safe obviously buffer
overflow becomes impossible because of
all the checks the language is going to
do so we set bounds check so those
checks have to be done at runtime rather
than you doing that explicitly in the
code that you write the language is
doing for you so why don't we use these
kind of languages for everything well
more and what we're doing that but one
drawback with these kind of languages
typically is that there's going to be
either some sort of performance
degradation because we just talked about
the checks that had to be done and now
they force you to do certain things in a
certain way and so flexibility that
generally you have with low-level
programming languages goes away so if
you're looking for really performance or
you know all the flexibility in the
world maybe that's why you don't use
these languages that do this work for
you to make the buffer overflow kind of
problems go away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
