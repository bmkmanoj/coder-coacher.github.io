this form one of the ideas you might
have had was to improve the visual
design with the theme of the form to
make it look a little bit more and ready
another thing we could have done is
maybe making the fonts a bit bigger
making the spacing a little bit wider
just to make the form kind of flow
better another idea would be to validate
the form so the user knows what to type
in if they got something wrong Naz well
do you have any thoughts on this yeah
actually if I were to answer this
question like 6 7 or even 8 years ago
when I had my startup I actually would
completely agree with everything you
said I probably like you created this
really awesome sign-in form but the
correct answer is actually not to have
one the most important thing to do in
this situation is to remove this form in
its entirety and replace it with sign-in
with Google or sign in with Facebook or
sign with LinkedIn who or whoever your
favorite social identity provider is
there's no reason to subject your user
to having to fill out all these long
forms when all they want to do is use
your application that's like the worst
time to actually bring this up instead
by removing this entire flow and having
a single button that they can use to
sign-in it makes their life easy and it
also makes your life easy because you
can now get out of the username and
password business and use social
identity providers who provide the
service for free reducing the amount of
work you have to do and also what your
user has to do in order to use your
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
