so again a lot feels like a good answer
it's already written down on the left
but it's also we may we can quantify
this so if it were maybe one way to
think about this is if each of the each
of those empty boxes there is either
true or false it's kind of like a bit
and we're asking how many different bit
patterns can we make and in general it's
two to the number of positions but here
the number of positions is two to the N
so it ought to be two to the two to the
N which is that the same as four to the
N no okay but you're right it's two to
the two to the N so it's a double
exponential and it's not the same thing
as four to the N it's actually two two
to the two to the N now how big of a
number do you think that is Michael I'm
going to go again to my go-to place and
just say a lot it is in fact a lot and
I'm going I actually I'm going to look
over here and I'm going to tell you that
for even a small value of n this gets to
be a really big number so for one it's 2
to the 2 to the 1 which is 4 that's not
a big number that's true
what about 2 for 2 it's 2 to the 2 to
the 2 so 2 to the 2 is 4 so it's 2 to
the 4 which is 16
what about 3 all right so that's 2 to
the 8th which is 256 mm-hmm so that's
growing pretty fast don't you think sure
but those aren't big numbers yet what if
I told you that for N equals 6 to 2 the
2 to the N was let's start writing it
okay one eight four six six seven four
four zero seven three seven zero nine
five five one six one six holy monkeys
yes that is in fact the technical term
for this number it's a holy monkey it is
a very very big number so 2 to the N
grows very fast we already called that
evil 2 to the 2
is a double exponential and it's super
evil it grows very very very very very
fast so what's the point in this
exercise Michael it's it's to point out
that the space of decision trees the
hypothesis space that we've chosen is
very expressive because there's lots of
different functions that you can
represent but that also means we have to
have some clever way to search among
them and that gets us back to our notion
of an algorithm with actually going to
very smartly go through and pick out
which decision tree because if we aren't
very smart about it and we start
eliminating whole decision trees along
the way then we're going to have to look
at two billions upon billions upon
billions upon billions upon billions of
possible decision trees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
