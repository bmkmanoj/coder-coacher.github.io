just learned and the key thing is we
talked about conditional probabilities
we said that the outcome variable like a
test is actually not like a random coin
flip but it depends on something else
like a disease and we looked at this we
were able to predict what's probability
of a test outcome even if we don't know
whether the person has a disease or not
and we did this using the truth table
and in the truth table we summarized
multiple lines so for example we
multiplied the probability of a test
outcome condition on this unknown
variable whether a person has a disease
multiplied by the probability of the
disease being present and if we added a
second row of the truth table where our
unobservable disease variable took the
opposite value of not disease written
this way it looks really clumsy but
that's effectively what we did when we
went to the truth table so we now
understand that certain coin flips are
dependent on other coin flips
so if god for example flips the coin of
us having a disease or not then the
medical test again is event has a random
outcome but it's probability V depends
on whether we have the disease or not
and we have to consider this when we do
probabilistic inference in the next unit
we're going to ask the real question say
we really care about whether we have a
disease like cancer or not what do you
think the probability is given that our
doctor just gave us a positive test
result and I can tell you you will be in
for a surprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
