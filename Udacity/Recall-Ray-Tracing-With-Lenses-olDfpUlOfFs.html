lecture where we talked about basically
using a lens and tracing rays of light
through a lens and see how an object is
then created on the image or a sensor
and that's how we go from a 3d scene to
create images here I'm starting with
that a simple object and let's see by
just doing simple ray tracing what
happens to this array of light goes
through the lens and of course goes
through the focal length here and it's
now on this side another ray of light
that goes through the optical center of
the lens which actually acts if you
recall like a pinhole go straight
through and similarly another light
comes in and now basically we seeing
that an image should be formed here of
course the image is upside down I'd also
introduced in the last lecture the whole
concept of a thin lens equation which is
shown here which basically relates the
focal length of an image with respect to
what the distance is of the image on
this side of the lens where the object
is on the other side a couple of things
to clarify also and point out here this
lens is a thin concave lens which is the
shape like this it's also sometimes
referred to as a positive lens because
all rays of light converge inside to
allow you to create an image on this
side of course convex lenses that have
shapes like this are also used sometimes
they referred to as negative lenses and
most of the time when you buy an
expensive lens from a camera it's a
combination of a series of these types
of concave convex lenses that move
together to create an effective lens
that's used to be able to allow you to
take the you know rays of light from a
scene on to your sensor and we will be
seeing some examples of this but there's
a lot of material that you can look up
on your own kind of study the importance
of these types of lenses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
