question is by looking at the first
message and why it makes sense to have
two bits per symbol so you can represent
this bit pattern in a tree so when a new
bit comes in it can be either 0 or a 1
if it's a 0 the next symbol can be
another 0 or it can be 1 the same case
here so if there are two zeros it is an
A if it is a 0 followed by 1 it is a B
if it is a 1 followed by 0 does a C ever
is 1 followed by 1 it is a D so that is
why you need to ask 2 questions to reach
either of these symbols but what happens
in this new language so in this new
language a occurs 50% of the time so we
can directly ask if it is a or not a so
let's represent that as 0 or 1 and let a
be 0 so now we got our a as just a 0 now
if we go on the one branch we can again
ask if it was a 0 or a 1
now observe that D occurs twice as
frequently as B or C so in this case we
can represent D here using 1 0 and then
B or C can occur on this branch but both
cannot occur at the same place so we
need to differentiate between them using
others involved so let's do that using 0
and 1 again so this can be B and this
can be seen so B is basically 1 1 0 and
C will be 1 1 1 now have is actually
saved any bits per symbol have we saved
the number of questions we ask yes
because a occurs more frequently
I mean you to ask only one question but
what is the exact number of questions we
have to ask person balls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
