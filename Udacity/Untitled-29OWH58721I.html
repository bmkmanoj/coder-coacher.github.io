for a broad range of devices software
and tools that help any person with a
disability complete a task in the
broader sense this includes something as
low-tech as a crutch to help someone a
walk or a magnifying glass to assist
reading or as high tech as robotic
prostheses or image recognition software
running on a smartphone it can include
something as general as browser zoom or
a specific is a custom-designed game
controller it can be a separate physical
device like a Braille display all be
implemented completely in software like
voice control it can be built into an
operating system like some screen
readers or it can be an add-on like a
curved extension and assistive
technology in particular is pretty
blurry after all all technology has been
built to assist people with some tasks
or another and things often move in and
out of the assistive technology category
for example one of the earliest
commercial speech synthesis products was
a talking calculator for the blind and
now we see speech synthesis popping up
all over the place from driving
directions to virtual assistants on the
other hand technology which is
general-purpose often finds in assistive
use for example people may use their
smartphones camera zoom to get a better
look at something small in the real
world in the context of web development
we're still talking about a diverse
range of technologies that we want to
support people may interact with your
website using a screen reader or Braille
display with a screen magnifier by voice
control using a switch device or some
other form of assistive technology which
adapts the page to create a more
specific interface that they can use for
all of these technologies ensuring that
our website support assistive technology
users is going to come down to
programmatically expressed semantics but
before we can explain exactly what
programmatically expressed semantics
refers to we need to talk a little bit
about affordances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
