Hadoop events so here's just a brief
summary your basic dupe cluster consists
of a name node a secondary name node
resource manager and one or more data
nodes I'll go through what each of these
does in a bit the type of node is
determined by the Hadoop daemon running
on the machine
these dudes here Damons are just
programs that run in the background they
handle all sorts of fun stuff like
communication across a cluster they
track jobs and resources and run
MapReduce code when you load data under
the cluster the files are split into
blocks then typically replicate it
across the data nodes so if a data node
dies your data is still around somewhere
MapReduce and other tools run in
parallel on the data nodes this
increases the effective computational
speed the name nodes stores metadata
about the blocks it stores it in a file
called FS image the name node stores
metadata about the blocks in a file
called FS image metadata is data about
the data in this case which block is
stored on which data node it's like an
address book for the blocks the
secondary name node logs edits to the
file system
the secondary name no locks changes to
FS image which are then used to update
the file on the name node it's actually
fairly poorly named though the same dry
name node stores only edits not the
actual FS image file so the name node
dies the block metadata is all gone the
resource manager is called yarn for yet
another resource negotiator now like its
resources like CPU and memory to
applications running on the cluster you
can run all the demons on one machine
that's called pseudo distributed mode
this is how I setup my computer when I'm
working on MapReduce programs in this
lesson you're gonna build a cluster with
one machine running the name node the
secondary name node and yarn the rest of
the cluster will be three data nodes now
let's get started deploying your cluster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
