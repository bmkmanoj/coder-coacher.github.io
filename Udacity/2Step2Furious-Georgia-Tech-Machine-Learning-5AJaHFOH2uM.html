okay sure so I'm gonna play these games
20 times in a row now what you've been
doing is you've been going forward you
said well if I can get us to do the
right thing or if I can basically
threaten you and say if you screw me
over this time I'll screw you over from
now on then maybe I can get you to do
the right thing and vice versa since
it's a symmetric gang and then we'll end
up doing the right thing all along and
that makes a lot of sense right yeah if
you're going forward but what if you're
going backward Michael let's imagine
we're doing what's amazing to me is that
that is exactly backward but you just
said so let's imagine we're doing these
$20 and now I'm on the 20th game okay
what's gonna happen on the 20th game
well I mean I guess I could have built
up trust in you from the previous games
and think that you're gonna cooperate
with me because we've been cooperating
together and then that would be the
perfect time to drop a dime on you
exactly so if this is the 20th game and
we're in this situation remember
whatever value we've been adding up
along the way that's sunk cost right the
only thing that's left is the final game
and the final game looks like this which
means we're gonna end up here but guess
what Michael the final one is determined
so since we already know the outcome of
the final game the only one that we the
next one that we can look at is the 19th
game well we already know what the
outcome of the final game is so this is
effectively the last game and what's
outcome of that gonna be it's gonna be
this and backwards backwards backwards
backwards proof by induction because the
only that proofs computer scientists
know how to do or proof by induction it
turns out that we will always defect or
destroy those are the only proofs worth
doing but okay that's true it's a fine
point truth by induction and perhaps by
conduction so there you go Michael even
if I can play multiple multiple games to
try to build up trust the truth is the
Nash equilibrium if I filled out that
8x8 matrix you wanted me to fill out I
would still end up in the same place
where I would defect both times
certainly if okay so if you're going to
be a jerk
then then I have to be a jerk but yeah I
guess that's right that's that seems
you're pretty horrible it is and by the
way this is not just something I'm
making up this is another theorem that
comes out of natural equilibrium that if
you have an in repeated game then the
solution is in repeated Nash equilibrium
so whatever the Nash equilibrium is for
the first game that one version of the
game is the repeated Nash equilibrium
for all versions of that game okay so I
okay I buy that mm-hmm
but couldn't you well so in a game that
has more than one Nash equilibrium
couldn't we like alternate we could and
in fact you'll notice that so far I have
not talked about the case where you have
multiple Nash equilibrium because in
fact that's its own problem if I have
one Nash equilibrium then we know what's
gonna happen if I have two Nash
equilibria which one do we choose now
what's important to note here is that if
we have two Nash equilibria then that
means that if you're in any one of them
you won't leave it so it's not like
you'll move from one Nash equilibrium to
another sort of in the general case
because the fact that it's an
equilibrium means that if everyone else
is fixed except one person that person
won't choose to move but I haven't said
anything about how you would choose
among multiple Nash equilibria and
that's beyond the scope of this class
okay but it is an active research area
and in fact some of my own students have
done some work in thinking about what it
would mean to choose and actually the
answer always boils down to let's not
worry about that all right but I'm still
kind of disturbed by this right so it
seems like it's sort of saying is if we
knew the world was going to end tomorrow
then we might as well be greedy bastards
and in fact if we know that the world is
going to end at any particular time
which of course it will we might as well
be greedy bastards that's right so be
greedy bastards Oh
or at least be you know Nash bastards
well the Nash is kind of greedy right
it's like I'm always taking an action
that's best for me yes you are no every
single thing we've talked about today
has always assumed that you're always
doing what's best for you the fact that
it might also be best for someone else
is neither here nor there you're always
doing what's best
right I get I get that but it's it
sounds like this argument is saying that
we might as well be like that like all
the time and never really forum like
never never self-sacrifice even a little
bit for greater advantage even to
yourself well that's not true it's just
it's all hidden in the utilities once
you've gone through all the what I'm
gonna do today what I'm gonna do
tomorrow you add it all up whatever the
right strategy is to take that's the
strategy that you take because it's
already accounted for all the
self-sacrifice you might do that then
leads to later good deeds or later good
outcome so the wonderful thing about all
of this is that this matrix is
everything you need to know it captures
the Future Passed and everything else
everything you need to know is right
here and it's all been reduced to a
bunch of pairs of numbers but you did
say something kind of interesting though
Michael which i think is worth pointing
out which is it everything you say
requires knowing when at least in this
sort of iterated version requires
knowing when the world is going to end
so an interesting question to ask would
be what would happen if I knew the world
was gonna end that I didn't know when
would that change my behavior it doesn't
seem like that should make any
difference because it's so going to end
if not today then tomorrow or if not
tomorrow then the next day true but I
bet you it does make a difference I'm
willing to go and think about that okay
once you go think about it and let me
know alright I'll tell you about it in
the next lecture then okay I like that
excellent ok cool so let's move on ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
