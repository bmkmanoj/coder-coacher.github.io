magnetic disks and how long does it take
to get to our data we will assume that
the disk is already spinning if the disk
is not spinning it takes possibly
several seconds to actually spin up the
disks so most of the time if you are
accessing our data frequently the disk
will just keep spinning so if the disk
is spinning then the access time
consists of the seek time which is the
time it takes to move the head assembly
to the correct cylinder for our data so
we know where the data is we know which
cylinder which sector which surface we
first have to get the heads so that they
are above the correct cylinder so at
that point one of the heads will be
above the track where our data really is
next there is the rotational latency
after we have moved the heads there
somewhere along the track but not
necessarily and usually not above the
very sector that we are interested in so
the rotational latency is about waiting
for the start of our sector to finally
get under the head that will read it
note that the head is actually sitting
in one place at this point but the
platter is rotating so different parts
of the track are getting under the head
and the rotational latency is how long
until the beginning of our sector gets
under the head next we have the data
read which is we read until the end of
the sector is seen by the head again the
data it really depends on how fast the
disk is spinning and how many sectors we
have per track for example if the whole
track is just one sector then the data
read will be a whole rotation of the
disk if we have ten sectors per track
then the data read will be one-tenth of
a rotation then there is some controller
time for the disk controller to actually
check the checks and determine that the
sector is okay and so on and the i/o bus
time which is once the disk drive itself
and its controller have the data how
long does it take to actually get that
data to the main memory
now note that unlike a cache or a dram
where we could actually be doing
multiple accesses potentially at the
same time on a magnetic disk once we
seek to one track we cannot really be
reading the other tracks so really what
happens is accesses to the disk are
happening one at a time we go to a track
positively read several sectors but we
cannot access another track until we are
done with this one and move to the next
track so all of this is the latency to
do one disk access and often times the
latency of a disk request made by the
operating system includes this plus a
significant queuing delay because we
first have to wait for previous accesses
to finish doing this and only then our
axis can move the heads to the correct
position and do a read or a right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
