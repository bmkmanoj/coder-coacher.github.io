isolation when it comes to protection
and security isolation is actually your
friend that means you know I am isolated
from somebody else and they can't do
anything bad to me untrusted user code
has to be isolated from the system code
okay we talked about trusted system code
tamper-proof pneus that we're talking
about you shouldn't be able to alter it
and only way you can go in the operating
system is through system calls that are
defined by the operating system and so
on so how are we going to achieve this
isolation of user code the reason I want
you to think about this is what is a
processor do it says fetch the next
instruction to execute it you need some
operands that are somewhere in memory
you fetch those you execute instruction
and you keep doing that forever well i'm
using let's running executing some user
code why can't I say the next
instruction I want to switch to
somewhere in the operating system or the
next data item i want to bring is a data
structure that resides in the operating
system if you try to do that we said you
won't be able to do it because we have
this execution mode we are talking about
and things like that so we're going to
use that hardware support to achieve or
accomplish this isolation separating or
separation of user code from the
operating system code so let's see how
we actually going to be able to do that
well the way to do that is again I said
it's going to rely on the hardware to to
protect memory so remember isolation I
said the way if using for executing in
user mode or executing user code and at
that point if the hardware can protect
memory with the operating system is what
does memory protection mean we said to
the process generates you know read
write requests a load store requests
sort of execute those instructions to
fetch the next instruction or fetch the
data that it's going to operate on it's
going to generate an address where it
wants to do a read or write well the
hardware says you're not allowed to
access that part of the memory a
hardware support is saying this is part
of memory that belongs to the operating
system that's what the operating system
code and data is if you're running in
user mode you not
to generate an address and be able to
complete a read or write in a memory
location that belongs to the operating
system so hardware support memory
protection essentially says if the
processor happens to generate an address
that is in the operating system the
hardware support we have for memory
protection is going to stop that memory
access from completing although
generating an address and it's a memory
location the hardware that potentially
can do a little right there but it
currently knows that its user code and
user code directly can't access the rate
of that or information that we have in
the operating system part so the
hardware is going to essentially stop
that access from proceeding so hardware
is going to sort of keep you contend in
your space and and we'll get to that
it's not just OS user but it's also
across different user processes but it's
going to contain you within the area of
memory that belongs to you and if you
try to touch something else which you
can it's going to stop you from doing
that and the hardware is going to do
that how this hardware support we have
fun memory protection is actually going
to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
