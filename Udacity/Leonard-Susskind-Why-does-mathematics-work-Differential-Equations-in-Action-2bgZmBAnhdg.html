Wigner wrote about the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics in the
Natural Sciences and indeed one man can
sit in one's living room and do good
Duncan experiments and maybe you know
what that word means
I do not commute for ok fat exploring
sperm she could do these thought
experiments and come up with something
like the general third general theory of
relativity
he'd discover black holes and describe
the curvature of space-time and why is
that so could it be that we only
perceive what we can describe with the
help of mathematics and vice-versa
because mathematics has co-evolved with
our brain look Eugene Wigner made a big
problem for the river every generation
that came after him to answer this
question why mathematics works
why does mathematics F and sometimes I
think to myself what how could it not
work the world has some coherence to it
things don't just randomly happen how do
you describe things that don't randomly
happen if they don't randomly happen you
have to have some kind of quantitative
framework for explaining what happens so
I can't a man on the one hand I can't
imagine a world that didn't work
according to some kind of laws and those
laws being written mathematically on the
other hand they also can't quite
understand why mathematics works so
Eugene asked a very difficult question
and he didn't know the answer and I
think I I don't know the answer either
but but here's what I would say here's
what I would say not why does
mathematics work but why do we need
mathematics to explain physics why is it
so hard to explain physics in the
English language and the reason is
because yeah we may have evolved as a
species some mathematical abilities but
we evolved them in the context of rather
ordinary things the ordinary things be
how stones move when you throw them
when it comes to waves we have some
perspective about water wave is because
we see water making waves and so forth
we have a good concept of what are
forces because if I give you a good
shove you'll say oh don't force me we
know what force means but every time we
enter into a new range of parameters we
make things smaller than anything that
we were then we grew up with in other
words we go to the quantum world or we
go to the world of very very heavy
things and dense things in other words
we go to the world of black holes we
suddenly find that the intuitions and
the concepts that we evolved with are
not sufficient to understand an example
we use higher dimensional spaces all the
time we think we sometimes think for
example that the space itself may be
more than three dimensions you evolved
you and I evolved in a world of three
dimensions we can't visualize more
dimensions and we can't because our it's
not that we're not smart enough it's
that the neural architecture the
architecture of the brain itself was
purposefully built while it wasn't
purposefully built but it evolved in a
world of three dimensions the
architecture is appropriate for three
dimensions and it's not appropriate for
four or five six seven dimensions if we
think that we're interested in a space
with seven dimensions or whatever how do
we describe it if we can't visualize it
we describe it by pure mathematics we
say a three-dimensional world is
described by a bunch of points that are
labeled by x y&amp;amp;z that's an abstraction I
can visualize three dimensions in my
head but I use XY and z to describe them
mathematically now I go to four
dimensions or five dimensions I can't
visualize it anymore
I can't visualize it anymore I can't
close my eyes and see a five dimensional
world but I can add two more letters to
the alphabet I can add the XY and Z W
and V and now I have a five dimensional
space how do I work with it I work with
it using algebra I work with it using
using abstract mathematics and I don't
try to see it in my head in trying to
explain it the people who don't have the
mathematical background we get stuck I
can't say now close your eyes and view
in your head five dimensions because I
can't do it either
what like all I can do is say take XY
and Z and add V and W eventually if
eventually a person with this kind of
mathematical background begins to
develop mathematical intuitions for
things they don't need the same kind of
visualization so we're stuck we're stuck
needing mathematics because evolution
didn't equip us to be able to visualize
quantum mechanics
it didn't visualize us to be able to
there sorry it didn't equip us to be
able to visualize eleven dimensional
space-time and that that's the reason
evolution did it to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
