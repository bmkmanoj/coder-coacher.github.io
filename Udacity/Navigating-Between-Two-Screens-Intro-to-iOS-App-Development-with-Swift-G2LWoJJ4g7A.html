start writing navigation controller
Xcode autocompletes it for me it says
here that the navigation interface makes
it possible to present your data
efficiently and makes it easier for the
user to navigate that content so that
seems that UI navigation controller will
help me navigate between two different
screens on my app cool okay so if I go
back to storyboard I can see that the
first screen of my app is right here to
add another one I can open up utilities
and add a new view controller from this
list notice that we are adding a view
controller in this case alright I'm
going to slide out the utility area and
then arrange these view controllers
properly so here I have the first screen
of my app and imagine that this new view
controller which for now is empty is
going to contain a view which will
display the second screen of my app this
screen is going to have all of the
buttons that will allow us to place
sounds for now all I want to do is
connect this stop button to this new
view controller now the way to do this
is to press and hold ctrl on your
keyboard and then drag from the stop
button onto the new view controller this
will present a bunch of options called
segues you can think of segues as
transitions between these two view
controllers almost like transitions
between two different slides in a
presentation I will select show okay so
the two view controllers are connected
at this point I'm going to try and run
the app and see if it even works I'm
going to press the microphone button
alright the recording label and the stop
button start to show up correctly so far
so good
what happens after I click the stop
button hey hey here's the second screen
of our app and I also have the back
button and when I click that I can go
back to the full screen let me try one
more time this seems to be working
alright so there are a couple of things
I want to do back in the storyboard I
can add a title here and then try to run
the app again alright so you'll notice
that the title of the first screen has
changed and then if I try to go to the
second screen the back button there has
also changed brilliant by the way all of
this back and forth navigation this top
bar and the back button all of this was
accomplished
I this UI navigation controller right
here so let's think about this a little
bit more deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
