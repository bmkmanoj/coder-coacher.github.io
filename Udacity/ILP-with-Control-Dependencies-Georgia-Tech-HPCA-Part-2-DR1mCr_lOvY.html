ILP we completely ignore false
dependencies among data dependencies and
only consider true or flow or read after
write data dependencies so alpi really
only looks at those data dependencies
but there are two other types of
dependencies in addition to data
dependencies there are structural
dependencies and control dependencies
how do they affect ILP and the answer is
that first of all when looking at LP
there are no structural dependencies
structural dependencies occur when we
don't have enough hardware to do things
in the same cycle when computing the ILP
we are assuming ideal hardware and as
part of being ideal it has no structural
dependencies meaning any instruction
that could possibly execute in the same
cycle will execute in that cycle and not
have to wait on some resource like for
example there being only one adder so we
can do only one add in a cycle we can
assume that we have an infinite number
of adders so if we want to do an ADD we
do it for control dependencies we assume
that we have perfect same cycle branch
prediction meaning that branches are
predicted in the same cycle in which we
fetch them so we see all the correct
instructions after the branch in the
same cycle in which we see a branch
let's see an example of this where we
have a program that has a flow
dependence and also an output dependence
and then we have a branch that has a
flow dependence on r1 and branches to
label if the condition is satisfied
otherwise continues on and then after
the branch in the program we have an
instruction and add the label we have
another instruction so now let's see how
we compute ILP here and these are
against cycles so what happens is in the
first cycle we can definitely do this we
cannot do them all in the first cycle
because it depends on the add so we will
have to wait until the second cycle to
do it the branch can actually not be
done until the third cycle because
that's where we compare this now let's
say that this branch is a
taken what we can assume is that
although the branch cannot execute until
the third cycle from the beginning since
we started fetching the program we knew
what the branch is gonna do so we knew
that the branch is gonna go to the label
and thus this instruction because it has
no data dependencies on any other
instruction will actually execute in the
first cycle although it has a control
dependence so as you can see not only
are control dependencies not resulting
in any delays after the branch happens
actually we are assuming perfect branch
prediction and that means that this
branch is predicted even before it's
executed so that we can just do
dependent instructions pretty much we
can completely ignore control
dependencies the branch acts as an
instruction that simply produces no
results so it eventually has to execute
but it has really no impact as far as
delaying other instructions is concerned
so in this case not only does the
multiply instruction execute even before
the branch on which it has a control
dependence execute also the instructions
that this mall will feed values to can
execute before the branch so pretty much
a branch itself might be delayed because
of true dependencies but it's control
dependencies on that branch have
absolutely no impact on what the ILP
will be because we are assuming perfect
branch friction where all the branches
in the program are perfectly predicted
in the same cycle as soon as we begin
fetching the program and from the
beginning of the program we knew exactly
which instructions will execute so that
we can just do them according to data
dependencies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
