single vertex at a time it normally
doesn't know about the whole triangle so
this statement is false the vertex
shader is given just one vertex at a
time so has only its position the second
statement is true the vertex shader can
output the shading normal which is then
interpolated across the triangle surface
the fragment shader will probably want
to normalize the shading normal before
using it the third statement is also
true even though the vertex itself does
not have a color stored in it the vertex
shader can compute and output anything
it wants even though we call the outputs
things like position normal color and so
on as far as the GPU is concerned it's
all just data to interpolate the fourth
statement is false for the same reason
the first is false each vertex is
processed separately by the vertex
shader so data from a specific vertex
cannot be passed to the fragment shader
in this way you could work around this
limitation by doing expensive things
like storing the data for all three
vertices at every vertex and have the
vertex shader sorted out a better
solution is to use a geometry shader if
available currently it's not supported
by WebGL how many times have I said this
but I really do expect this will change
in the future when available the
geometry shader is optional and is
applied after the vertex shader it
allows you to access the data for the
triangle as a whole you can in fact use
the geometry shader to create new points
lines and triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
