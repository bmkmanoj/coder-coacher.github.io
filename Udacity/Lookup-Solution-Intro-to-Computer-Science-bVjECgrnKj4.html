lookup procedure it takes two inputs the
index and a keyword and as a reminder
I've drawn the structure of the index
here it's a list each element in the
list is an entry each entry is a list
itself where the first part of the list
is the keyword and the second part is a
list of URLs so what we want to do to
define lookup is very similar to what we
did for head to index we want to go
through the entries in the next to try
to find one that matches the keyword so
let's write that again that's going to
be a for loop and it's going to be
exactly the same code as we had before
so we're going to loop through the
elements in the index each time we go
through the loop the variable entry will
refer to one of those elements we're
going to check if the value in position
0 which is the keyword of that entry
matches the keyword we're looking for
when we were defining add to index what
we did when we found a match was the pen
the URL to the list of URLs associated
with that keyword what we want to do for
lookup is different all we need to do
for lookup now is return the list of
URLs and we can find that by looking in
position 1 of entry if we get to the end
of the list without finding that keyword
well then we still need to return
something and the way we describe lookup
what it should return is the empty list
that means there are no URLs that we
found so far they contain that keyword</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
