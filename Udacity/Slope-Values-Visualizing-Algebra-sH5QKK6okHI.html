was negative as we look at this graph
from left to right the line goes down if
someone were walking or hiking along
this line they'd be going downhill which
corresponds to negative slope our slopes
don't always have to be negative though
if we turn the line slightly we can see
that we would have a flat line we know a
flat line has zero slope because it has
lots of run but no rise and 0 / any
nonzero number would make 0 we could
also turn our line a little bit more
this would produce a positive slope so
now we would be walking uphill positive
slopes always point up into the right
the last type of line is a vertical line
and these slopes are undefined they have
lots of rise but zero run remember we
cannot have 0 in the denominator so the
slope must be undefined for our walking
guy we also remember he can't walk up a
vertical wall that's impossible so the
slope is undefined so that might be a
way you can remember the slope is
undefined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
