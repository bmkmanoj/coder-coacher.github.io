actions area is where you want to drag
it so let's put it in there oh it
doesn't like it so we have to override
the global publisher layout first
there's right now you know we saw those
actions already those are the that's the
global am that's just what everything
automatically has but if we override
that layout we can add in our own custom
actions all right may I overridden
adding set time and put it closer to the
legs always here maybe after post

Udacity stage and it says at a set time
