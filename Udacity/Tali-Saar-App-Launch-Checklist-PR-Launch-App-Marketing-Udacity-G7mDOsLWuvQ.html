quickly you'll want to have writers and
tech magazines mentioning you to help
spread the word about your products if
you can getting it tweet a public
donation or a mention from a relevant
celebrity or a peer leader that supports
your product can be a huge help working
with a pure firm can be expensive but
might be worth considering if you have a
big bank launch like a Kickstarter
campaign or any other specific launch
date that you want to create a big buzz
around PR firms can help you get big
names reporters or celebrities to
promote your business however if it's
too early for your startup to spend
budget on PR you can always do it
yourself if you just do it yourself
you'll want to start by writing a
paragraph that you like writers to write
if you could have them write whatever
you want this will help you clearly
identify how you want your company to be
presented in the press check out the
instructor notes for an article on tips
for how to do this and let's see what
Sally Starr has to say about PR in the
early stages of a startup
hi I'm tally Starr I'm the founder and
CEO of rooster before starting Brewster
I spent four years at Google I was on
the marketing team and I was part of the
founding team that started a program
called Google Engage which developed
today into Google partners which is a
global program I left Google I came to
Silicon Valley and I was first employee
for a startup called honey book and then
I started my company rooster a year and
a half ago rooster is a paid forward
movement we're building a local network
that brings people together to help
borrow and share with one another
completely for free in their local
communities so the ideas you the idea is
you join rooster in your location and
you create a profile you have your real
identity there and then the rules are
you can ask for whatever you need
or in help whenever you can but it has
to be for free so people use it to hand
down used furniture and items they don't
need like sofas TVs art supplies they
borrow baseball bats and baby cribs from
one another they walk each other's dogs
they help each other fix their bike
chains and things like that we're
currently launched in three cities with
thousands of users and a lot of them
music daily and meet each other and have
all these great experiences starting
with VR with low budget it's funny a lot
of startups operate under the assumption
that doing PR is this really complicated
thing and you have to build personal
connections with
the reporters and you have to kind of be
in the scenes so that they'll want to
write about you in my experience not
true at all
PR and journalists you know this is
their job is to get these stories and
all you need to do is kind of understand
their world and where they're coming
from and know how to pitch them and have
an interesting story to tell right so
you want to have a product that's
interesting enough you want to have some
kind of traction or some kind of story
something that you know can make a news
story and you'll know when you have it
and then you just want to be very
thoughtful of the journalists time so
you want to research who your
journalists are that cover your space
that will potentially be interested in
this don't go and pitch you know a
thousand irrelevant people and once you
have those people just write in a very
clear and concise way and just consider
that they they're getting hundreds of
emails per day and you have to grab
their attention first right so just
write a very compelling title write a
very clear and concise pitch about why
this should be interesting to them and
just go and do it go and reach out to
all these people and in my experience
you know I got great stories in local
press and in the tech countries of the
world and and everywhere I wanted just
by you know giving the right person the
right story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
