drawing stand out if it's only in black
and white we can change the color of
fills and strokes by using these to fill
style in stroke style we can call fill
style on the canvas context and in this
case we're going to set it to blue you
can use a name color there are 140 named
colors according to the HTML
specification and you can learn more
about them in the instructor notes or
you could use a hexadecimal color so in
this case we're setting the stroke style
color to 33 CC 33 and we're calling it
on the canvas hopefully these two should
add some color to our drawing over here
let's find out i will save it i will
come over here and hit refresh and we
see that in fact the fill actually did
become blue our triangle is now blue
which is pretty cool but it looks like
stroke style here didn't have an effect
this hexadecimal color should be a shade
of green but we don't see any green over
here and that's because fill style and
stroke style only apply to the phils and
strokes that come after them inside your
script so in this case because we're
calling fill after we set fill style we
have a nice blue triangle but because we
drew our stroke rectangle well before we
set the stroke style it didn't get
affected let's go ahead and change that
so now we set the stroke style to this
color before we draw the rectangle and
we should see green rectangle instead so
let's save our script come over to the
browser and hit refresh and now the
rectangle has a nice light green outline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
