implement some pretty cool image
blurring techniques and you now know
enough that you could go and implement
that program on a massively parallel GPU
and you'd get a correct answer and it
would be pretty fast but we can do
better now we have all the ingredients
to start talking about writing efficient
parallel programs in CUDA for now I'm
only going to talk about high-level
strategies we're going to have a whole
unit later on about detailed
optimization approaches to help you
really squeeze the maximum performance
out of the GPU so think of this as a
preview that covers some of the really
important high-level things you have to
keep in mind when you're writing a GPU
program so the first thing to keep in
mind is that GPUs have really incredible
computational horsepower okay high end
GPU can do over three trillion math
operations per second yes sometimes see
this written down is T flops okay a flop
stands for a floating-point operation
per second so T flops is teraflops and
modern GPUs can do over three trillion
of these every second at the high end
but all that power is wasted if the
arithmetic units that are doing the math
need to spend their time waiting while
the system fetches the operands from
memory so the first strategy we need to
keep in mind is to maximize arithmetic
intensity arithmetic intensity is
basically the amount of math we do per
amount of memory that we access so we
can increase their automatic intensity
by making the numerator bigger or by
making the denominator smaller so this
corresponds to maximizing the work we do
per thread or minimizing the memory we
do per thread and let's be more exact
about what we mean here really what
we're talking about is maximizing the
number of useful compute operations per
thread and really what we care about
here is minimizing the time spent on
memory per thread and I phrased this
carefully because it's not the total
number of memory operations we care
about it's not the total amount of
memory that comes and goes in the course
of a thread executing its program it's
how long it takes us to do that so there
are a lot of ways to spend less time on
memory accesses and that's what we're
going to talk about now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
