intern at jawbone I'm I've been going to
school for art for three years and then
I switched over to Electrical
Engineering the reason I started that
was it started off as a bet with another
friend and the ventilation started off
that I couldn't learn how to program and
I kind of being a little bit spiteful
and be like no I can do this like I
improved them wrong I signed up for a
computer or intro to computer science
course and that whole semester like it
was really really like terrifying to get
into because I had no idea what I was
doing but by the time finals rolled
around and I'm just host mustard pasture
I'm like I can't do this I don't think I
can do this and I got my final grade and
then I was like wow I can do this like I
actually enjoy this I'd which was kind
of something I wasn't expecting but
after that I kind of decided like you
know what this is something I haven't
enjoyed in years like just having like
challenging problems that like I'm
excited to sit there and like program
for our isn't like I'm gonna solve this
I'm gonna do it and so I decided that I
had to do something different and I
decided well I'm gonna try to do
electrical engineering it's a little bit
more hands-on with hardware but I still
kept that programming element so that's
what's led me to do an internship now at
jawbone and I've been doing three years
of electrical engineering at the
University of Pittsburgh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
