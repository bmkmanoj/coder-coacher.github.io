the explorers this week on human robot
interaction and robot ethics I'm here
with the director of Silicon Valley
robotics Sondra Kay hundred how are you
I'm great
good to be here can you tell me a little
bit about how you got started in
robotics I've always been a tech geek
but I went through a few different
pathways before coming back to robotics
and I say coming back to it I actually
did film and television technologies and
then computer and internet technologies
and I felt that I was being behind the
curve so I thought what really is the
technology that is going to be the
biggest influence on the 21st century
and how do I make sure that that's the
technology that I'm involved with so I
went back to study robots and
particularly the areas around how robots
are going to how they're going to affect
society so I call it not just human
robot interaction the human robot
culture so the idea like coal bytes and
things like that as well just kind of
everything working together in a nice
definitely looking at how things work
together but going beyond how robots may
work with us as individuals and starting
to ask the questions like will all taxi
drivers be out of jobs if we had
self-driving vehicles is that a fact or
will there be slower transitions what
does it mean if we make a change quickly
versus as we make a change in stages and
perhaps some of the things are you know
where do we make big wrong assumptions
about what a technology impact will be
and how can we make better assumptions
at predictions around what the impacts
of technologies will be because I think
most of the headlines that you hear or
read are completely wrong and in fact
one of my favorite sayings is Moore's
law which is that we greatly
overestimate the short-term impact of
the technology that we vastly
underestimate the long term impact and I
see robotics and the AI that's embodied
in robotics as being with fundamentally
transformative technologies of the 21st
century but I think we get really
confused over what are the short-term
and long-term impacts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
