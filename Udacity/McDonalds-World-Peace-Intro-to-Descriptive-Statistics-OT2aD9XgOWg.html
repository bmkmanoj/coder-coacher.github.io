don't go to war but we don't know that
McDonald's makes people happy for one
thing and even if it does many other
factors could make people unhappy again
for this one I'm thinking that countries
that have McDonald's tend to be more
economically developed and therefore
have more money so it's implausible they
wouldn't be able to afford to go to war
that's my own hunch but I'm pretty sure
this is implausible for this one we
don't know anything about how many
people eat at McDonald's and how often
and we don't even know for sure if
eating McDonald's would make people too
unhealthy to engage in war this one
seems to be the most plausible option
countries with McDonald's are more open
to globalization and less inclined to go
to war but I have to admit that would be
pretty awesome if we could attain world
peace just by building a McDonald's in
every country if that were true I would
definitely advocate for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
