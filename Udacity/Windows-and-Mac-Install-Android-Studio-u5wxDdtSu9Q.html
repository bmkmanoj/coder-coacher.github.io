workshop which is the Android studio
program I suggest you watch me so that
you can have a sense of what the process
looks like and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace
also keep in mind that these are large
files you're going to want to have a
strong and stable internet connection
for students with slower and more
unreliable internet you might want to
consider finding a wired internet
connection I've created the walkthrough
for how to download Android studio on
two different operating systems I have
instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers I'll give
you a moment go ahead and click on which
one applies to you
okay I'm gonna be installing Android
studio on a Windows machine please note
that this screencast was done on April
7th 2015 and I say that just because
sometimes the screens or the icons that
you might see while installing Android
studio could change depending on what
version it is we're going to give you a
text version to go along with this
screencast and since it's easier to
change the text version than to go
through re-recording an entire
screencast that will be a little bit
more up to date than the screencast well
alright so to start off go ahead and
open a web browser and go to the Android
studio website it's linked in the
instructor notes you do not have to type
this in alright so once you've arrived
on the site you should see a big green
button that's pretty obvious that says
download Android studio for Windows so
go ahead and click that alright and
that's gonna take you to these license
for Android studio you're welcome to go
ahead and read that I'm gonna scroll to
the bottom sign my rights away and then
click this download Android studio for
Windows button
all right we did want to download this
so we do want to keep it I'm gonna press
keep okay and if you look right here
this is a little bit less than a gig of
data and that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of reasonable
quality so you can judge how long this
will take based on your internet
connection okay once it's finished
downloading go ahead and double click
the file we did in fact wanna run this
so click run yes we did one allowed to
make changes alright and now we're at
the Android studio setup wizard this is
gonna guide you through a collection of
screens to set up Android studio and
pretty much always we're gonna just
select the defaults all right so I'm
gonna hit next
I want all these boxes checked note that
this requires three point eight
gigabytes of space and we only download
about a gigabyte so after this there's
gonna be even more downloading I'm gonna
hit next it's a license agreement here
you can go ahead and read it if you'd
like I'm gonna go ahead and hit I agree
oh yes I agree more okay I'm alright
with all of these standard install
locations alright gonna say next on the
emulator setup we'll talk about this
later
sure let's make a start menu folder and
I'm gonna hit install which will bring
me to this screen okay so this is
another loading bar which might take a
little bit of time alright it looks like
it completed I could go ahead and take a
look at the show details and I'm not
seeing anything here about huge errors
so that's good
alright I'm gonna go ahead and click
Next okay so the install looks like it
finished we click finished this is the
little loading screen for Android studio
when it starts up okay now this is
asking if I have some settings from a
previous version of Android studio and
I'm pretty sure that you don't so you
probably want to hit the I don't have a
previous version of Android studio or I
don't want to import my settings and go
ahead and hit OK it's just going ahead
of downloading a few more components for
me now once you see this screen you know
that you've got Android studio up and
running but the real test to see if you
did everything correctly will be if you
can make your first app using it all
right so this completes the installation
video and now you're gonna do this
process on your own
alright I'm gonna
Android studio on a Mac note that this
screencast was done April 6 2015 and the
reason I'm saying that is because
sometimes this process will change we
will always provide you with text
instructions for the install process and
we will keep those instructions up to
date so if things look a little bit
different here and there
don't worry check out the text install
structions alright and with that little
mini now let's get started okay so the
first thing you're gonna do is click the
link in the instructor notes below to
get to the Android studio homepage don't
try typing this out just click the link
in the instructor notes once you're here
there's gonna be a pretty obvious button
that says download Android studio and it
should say for mac go ahead and click it
at this point you'll see a license
agreement you can read it if you like
and then go ahead and scroll down click
the key Fred it and then click this
download Android studio for Mac button
okay so it's started downloading here
for me now you should be able to see
that this download is a couple hundred
megabytes once it's downloaded go ahead
and double click it you should see this
big beautiful screen that says Android
studio and as with most applications
you're gonna go ahead and click Android
studio and drag it into your
Applications folder that will copy over
after you successfully done that you can
go ahead and double-click Android studio
which will try to actually open Android
studio you might get a warning about it
being downloaded from the web but we did
mean to download this and we did mean to
run it so go ahead and click open
alright and this little screen should
appear to load up the installation
process all right and here we are at the
Welcome wizard
what follows is going to be a list of
screens and licenses and you pretty much
just want to keep the defaults and click
Next this is a screen asking me where my
java development kit is now we just
installed that and it's actually making
a guess about where it is if it isn't
guessing you can create the detect
button and if that isn't working
you can try navigating your file system
to go exactly to where you downloaded it
if you're having trouble with this step
it probably means that there were issues
with downloading the Java development
kit you might have downloaded the wrong
file or just something might not be
configured right try going through the
instructions again or checking out the
troubleshooting documents everything
seems to be working here so I'm gonna go
ahead and click Next now we're not doing
anything
- crazy so I'm gonna choose a standard
installation here are some of the
licenses that I was talking about go
ahead and click on this first license
and say accept they'll accept all these
licenses down here you'll have to click
on the next license set here and also
hit accept and this will let you finish
the Android studio setup wizard okay
when I click finish it's actually going
to download a lot of stuff and when all
this entails is downloading a couple
gigs of data which is sort of a huge
amount of stuff to download so be
patient this might take some time if you
see this window go ahead and typing your
password and the candy cane stripes here
mean that this is close to done awesome
and once you're done you should see this
screen hopefully there's a lot of
positive language like successfully
installation pass successfully created
if you see any errors here it could mean
that there are errors with the
installation but things look good so I'm
gonna go ahead and click finish
now once you see this screen you know
that you've got Android studio up and
running so great job but the real test
is gonna be seeing if we did everything
correctly enough that we can create our
own apps using it all right so now
you've watched me do the steps once I
want you to go ahead and download
Android studio yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
