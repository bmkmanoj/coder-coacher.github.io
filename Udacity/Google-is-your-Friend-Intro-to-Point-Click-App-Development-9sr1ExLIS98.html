function that's only for pick list
fields but I can't remember what it was
maybe we should copy and paste that
error into google and see if it tells us
what that air is formula for picklist
field right here awesome Ellen Williams
so she also was writing an if statement
that was using pick list values and so
you can see here if is pick val which is
the function that you need to use that's
the stage name is the field and then
pending is probably the picklist value
so if the stage name is pending do this
okay so we need to use that also it's
funny that she was doing with stages to
Williams so let's grab from the
functions on the right on over here we
can grab text is picked it out there it
is okay and where do we want to put this
if in that first yeah over the ticket
type VIP okay and now my pic list field
he's going to be ticket type and the
text is VIP yep all right let's check
the syntax now awesome that's cool all
right this formula is a bit of a beast I
would not have come up with it by myself
but I guess google was a good good tool
is that something you find yourself
doing alone you're developing um yeah I
mean because I'm not supposed to
remember everything and so definitely
whenever I run into errors i'll google
the error itself because a lot of people
have read into the same things before
there's also on the upper right hand
corner these quick tips for getting
started seeing samples more examples I
mean there's a lot of tools available if
you are new to formulas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
