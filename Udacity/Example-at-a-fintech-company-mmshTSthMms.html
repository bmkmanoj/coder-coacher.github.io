process to build a machine learning
based forecaster at a fin tech company
at my company the center research a
first step is to select which factors do
you want to use so those are our X's
remember it can be multi-dimensional so
these are things like Bollinger Bands
p/e ratio and so on
measurable quantities about a company
that can be predictive of its stock
price the next step is to select what is
it you want to predict usually we want
to predict change in price market
relative change in price or for now we
can just think about that as future
price these both become our data our X's
and our wise that we use to train the
model now that we know what our
predictive factors are and what Y is
gonna be we need to consider the breadth
and depth of the data that we're going
to use to train the system with so that
includes for instance time period how
far back in time do you want to go to
train the system and what's your stock
universe what universe of data you know
which symbols are going to use to train
the system as well now we can train our
model we can take this data to produce
that model we unleash our machine
learning algorithm this might be KNN it
might be linear regression
it could be decision tree whatever that
algorithm takes us data and converts it
into a model we're ready now to use that
model to do some prediction the way we
do that is we measure the quantities
about the stocks that we want to make a
prediction for now we measure what those
X's are today plug those into the model
and the model should provide us our Y or
our prediction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
