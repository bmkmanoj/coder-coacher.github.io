explore a data set that resembles user
activity on Facebook but before we get
to that data set I need to show you how
to read an data that doesn't come with
our and how to subset that data it turns
out that not all data sets can be easily
loaded like the empty cars data set and
the instructor notes you can find a link
to download a new data set this data set
is going to contain information on the
50 states in the u.s. most of the data
comes from about 1970 before we can read
in the data we need to set our current
working directory so to figure out what
director you're in now you can type in
get WD we can run this command and see
the output to the console it looks like
I'm already in the downloads file and
that also appears here on the top of my
console so I don't need to change my
directory but maybe you do to change
your directory you can type set WD this
will take a string which will be the
file path to whatever directory you want
to go to my guess is that your data set
is in your downloads file so I would
probably run this command now it's an
important to note that whether or not
you're on a Mac or Windows machine you
still need to separate your paths or
your folders with a forward slash also
be sure that you use quotes around your
path now in order to load up the data we
can use the reads V command this command
takes a string which is the name of the
file and here we're going to pass it to
a variable called States info States
info is going to save all of our data
into a data frame when I run this code I
can see that state's info appears in my
environment I can double click on the
data frame in the workspace and this
will let me see the table of values in
our studio now let's say I wanted to get
information on States located in only
the Northeast those states would be
states like Connecticut and they have a
state region of 1 I'm going to go back
to my r script and write a command that
pulls in this data the subset command
would look like this here I'm passing
the data frame States info to subsets
and I'm asking for it to retrieve any
states that have a state region equal to
1 when I run this code I can see the
output down below we have Connecticut
Maine and many others now there is
another way to subset this data frame
and I want to show you it just so that
way you don't get confused later if you
see it it uses bracket notation where we
have
name of our data set followed by two
brackets and we'll have a comma in
between this first spot is for the rows
of our data set that we want to keep and
the second spot is for the columns that
we want to keep so if I want only the
states in the northeast I would write
this code the name of the dataset is
States info and then I want the rows
that have a state region equal to one
now I can't just use state region here I
need to access the actual variable so I
have to put state's info and the dollar
sign this gives me the actual variable
value and I can see if it's equal to one
if it is equal to one I want to return
every single column in the data frame so
for example with Connecticut if it's
state region is equal to one I want to
return every single column in this row
to return all the columns I'll just
leave this blank so this code searches
for rows that have a state region equal
to one and then it takes all the columns
in that row and all of this will be sent
to the console as a new data frame now
it might not be so helpful to have this
output just in the console so we can
save these subsets in two new variables
I'm also going to include some functions
to print out their first two rows of
each data frame and also their
dimensions hopefully I've convinced you
that they're the same data set now I
really want you to pay careful attention
to the syntax in both of these examples
throughout this course we tend to make
use of the subset command but there
might be instances where we use this
just know that both methods produce the
same result now I recommend that you try
subsetting this data frame for other
regions of the country on your own you
could also try finding out which states
have an illiteracy rate of 1/2 a percent
or which states have high school
graduation rates above 50% feel free to
play around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
