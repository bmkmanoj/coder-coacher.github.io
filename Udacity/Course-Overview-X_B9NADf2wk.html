you're going to lay the foundations by
training your first simple model
entirely end-to-end for that we'll need
to talk about logistic classification
stochastic optimization and general data
practices to train models in the next
session we're going to go deeper you'll
train your first deep network and you
also learn to apply regularization
techniques between even bigger models
the third session will be a deep dive
into images and convolutional models the
fourth session all about text and
sequences in general will train
embeddings and recurrent models this is
going to be a very hands-on course the
assignments are ipython notebooks that
you can read and modify easily play with
them and try things out we will use them
alongside the lectures to make
everything you will hear about very
concrete all the code will be written in
tensor flow a very simple Python based
deep learning toolkit by the time you're
done with these lectures you'll be able
to apply all this knowledge to new
problems entirely by yourself with a
handful of lines of code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
