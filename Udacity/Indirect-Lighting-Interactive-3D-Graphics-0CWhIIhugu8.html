you can see they're completely black
this is typically not what reality looks
like as an example the floor under your
desk is typically not completely black
even if no light from any specific lamp
is hitting it directly the classic hack
for working around completely black
shadows is the flat ambient light it
basically means adding a constant color
to all pixels as you can see the shadows
are no longer black but still they look
flat as an example you can't even see
where the edge between the wall and the
floor is in the shadow adding a constant
color like this doesn't simulate how
light behaves in reality you wouldn't be
able to buy a lamp like behaving like
this at IKEA let's see if we can do
better so how do like behave in real
life when you look at the point in the
scene what is it you actually see it's
the light from the light source being
reflected into your eyes but only a
fraction of the light reflected from a
surface is actually going into your eyes
this bounced or indirect light is a big
contribution of light in a scene let's
enable simulation of it now the shadows
looks much more interesting what's
really going on is that light hitting a
surface is being reflected back into the
sea this light can then be reflected
back again and again since the walls
absorb light with each bounce each
secondary bounds is weaker than the
previous one
you can also see how the light hitting
the red wall is being reflected back
into the scene as red light this is what
we call color bleeding and it happens
because the red wall absorbs all but the
red components of the light bouncing of
it to properly simulate indirect
lighting for complex scenes can be very
time-consuming single frames of high
quality rendering can literally takes
hours and even days this wraps up the
ambient and indirect light part thanks
for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
