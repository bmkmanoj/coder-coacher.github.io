you first have to open up the chrome
JavaScript console I can do this on a
Mac by using command option I or by
simply navigating to the toolbar looking
under the Tools menu and going to
JavaScript console as you can see here
the consoles load in the bottom but
since our pages already loaded there's
no debugger to catch let us try to
refresh the page and see if the debugger
will catch as you can see here in our
code the debuggers stopped execution at
line 19 to actually play around with the
execution context of our draw function
and inspect what our data is and what
variables are in scope let's navigate to
the console tab of the debugger
inspecting some of the variables just
for a sanity check we can print out data
and see that we have 836 data points
opening up this array we can inspect
what each object looks like in this case
we see attendance date goals and so
forth so every property of this object
represents one of the columns of our
data set but this might be hard to see
if we want to inspect our entire data
set since we have to open up every one
of these objects individually a little
trick of the chrome debugger is it has a
utility function called dot table that
we can call like we call console dot log
this is very similar to console dot log
but rather than just printing the naive
string representation of a variable if
the variable is in some collection be it
an array JSON or what have you the table
function instead prints out a nicely
formatted spreadsheet in the console
window let's go ahead and call console
that table on our data array this takes
a second since we have so many data
points but if you can see here counsel
that table has printed out all of our
data in a nice tabular format it's easy
to scroll and inspect scrolling to the
top of this you can see what the field
are in this case attendance goals
penalty kicks referee stadium and so
forth and we can also see here that we
have the year the time and the date you
might want to be careful with the
council that table function since as you
noticed it took a second to load this
can get quite unwieldy and potentially
crash your browser if you try with a
large data file as you can see the
structure is similar to what we
mentioned in the quiz and all the
columns should be identical the
variables of interest here are the year
column and the attendance column how
might we best represent attendance as a
function of year remember what we
mentioned when choosing a chart type we
need to think about our data types of
our variables in the abstract sense I
don't mean what JavaScript type they are
and also we want to think about what
type of relation between attendance in
the year we want to convey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
