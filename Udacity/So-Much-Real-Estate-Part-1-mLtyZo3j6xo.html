good now the next code you're going to
grab will transform the landscape tablet
view from this into this let's go over
how we accomplished this change first of
all you can see that we've added a
linear layout for the app bar which has
the correct elevation and blue primary
color background next we see the toolbar
rendered with the correct themes this is
a bit interesting we want to align the
sunshine logo with the forecast day
rather than hard coding the calculated
value we use nested frame layouts to
perform it this is a tiny bit expensive
but it makes it easy to create
responsive layouts finally we look into
how we position the detail view this is
a nice trick for creating to even
columns in a relative layout create a
center strut view that as no width or
height and ask relative layout to center
the view we can then create the forecast
fragment view to the left of this front
view and the detail fragment to the
right of the center strut view note that
we have to make sure that the layout
elevation at least matches the app bar
otherwise the detail fragment would be
occluded by the app bar rather than
overlapping it and that's it it's
actually a relatively simple relative
layout given how complex it looks let's
take a quick look on where the portrait
tablet layout stands yikes it's worse
than before we can fix it here are red
lines for what we want the portrait
layout to look like wow these
overlapping red lines are a bit
confusing we can bring the app bar
forward to analyze it so our app bar we
made in three sections the top section
is our toolbar with a height of action
bar size the middle section is are
imaged with a height of list preferred
item height and the bottom section is
our space review with a height of
details a bar overlap which we've just
added for you we use our standard 16 DP
of padding around the details fragment
and for our details fragment we're
actually going to use wrap contents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
