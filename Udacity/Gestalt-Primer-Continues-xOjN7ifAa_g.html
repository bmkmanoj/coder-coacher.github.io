Gestalt principles the first is the law
of past experience early apps and mobile
platforms took advantage of this by
showing you digital versions of things
from the physical world like notepads
stopwatches and weekly planners the
lines on the paper of a notepad app are
sometimes referred to as skeuomorphic
details there are ornamental decorations
that can make the UI feel a little more
comfortable and familiar to the user as
mobile devices became more and more
prevalent it became less and less useful
to incorporate these kinds of details
people became more and more comfortable
using apps that didn't exactly look like
their real-world counterparts and how
about the law of proximity returning to
the example from our quiz these boxes
representing text are close to these
circles that are likely images their
closeness tells us instinctively that
they must be related the text is
probably the label for the image even
without knowing what each item says we
won't mistake the relation between this
and this with something like this and
this we can also recognize that these
three items are close to each other
while the others aren't
this helps us further visually
deconstruct what's going on in this
screen finally we can take this a step
further with the law of similarity and
recognize that each of the items in this
list must represent similar things
because they look basically the same the
cool thing is all we did here to set up
these relationships was use white space
to our advantage
adding more space between elements
separated them both visually and
conceptually tightening the space
between elements helped them feel more
related to one another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
