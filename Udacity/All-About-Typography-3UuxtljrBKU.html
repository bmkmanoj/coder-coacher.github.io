item you should consider when creating a
great app Roboto the default sans-serif
font family for Android is a great place
to start as it was specifically designed
for user interfaces across a variety of
screens using Roboto gives you the
comfort of knowing your text will work
with a variety of languages and remain
crisp and legible on any screen and you
can use Roboto across your entire app
whether it be for headlines body text
smaller captions or whatever it includes
a bunch of weights like light regular
medium bold and black and variants like
condensed and slab having those variants
available in addition to font size and
color
lets you clearly communicate for example
what's a headline versus what's part of
the body text or as we sometimes say
it'll help you establish a clear
hierarchy for the text in your app now
typography is a really large topic and
will try to fit as much as possible into
this course but we can only cover so
much if you're interested in typography
outside the realm of mobile app design I
strongly encourage you to check out some
of the books linked in the instructor
notes there's a whole world of
information out there if you're a
typography fanatic like me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
