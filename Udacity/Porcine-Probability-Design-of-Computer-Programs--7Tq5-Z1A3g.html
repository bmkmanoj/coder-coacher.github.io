a tool for dealing with uncertainty once
you understand probability you'll be
able to tackle a much broader range of
problems that you could with programs
that don't understand probability and
often when we have problems with
uncertainty we're dealing with search
problems so we recall in the search
problem we are in a current state there
are other states that we can transition
into and we're trying to achieve some
goal but we can't do it all on one step
we have to paste together a sequence of
steps in doing that we're building up a
search frontier that we're continuing to
explore from now uncertainty can come
into play in two ways one we can be
uncertain about the current state rather
than knowing exactly where we are it may
be that we start off in one of four
possible States and all we know is that
we're somewhere in there but we're not
sure exactly where we are the other
place uncertainty can come in is when we
apply an action say this action here
action a it may be that we don't get to
one specific state but rather were
uncertain as to what the action will do
and we might end up in this state or
this date or this state instead of the
one that we were aiming at and so we'll
see techniques for dealing with both of
these types of uncertainty now one place
where people are used to dealing with
uncertainty is in playing games that
employ dice and that's what we're going
to deal with and in particular we're
going to play a dice game which is
called pig I don't know why the game is
called pig I can guarantee no port sign
creatures were harmed in the creation of
this unit but here's how the game works
there are two players although you could
play with more the players take turns
and on his turn a player has the option
to roll the dice single die as often as
he wants or to hold to stop rolling and
the object of the game is to score a
certain number of points we're going to
say 50 points 100 is more common but 50
will be easier on the Udacity servers in
terms of the amount of computation it
requires and so it's my turn and there
we have a score
so here's a scoreboard will have players
with the imaginative names of players 0
and player 1 and the score starts off
020 now there's another part of the
scoreboard that is not part of the
players score will call that the pending
score and let's say it's my turn I pick
up the die I roll it and let's say I get
a five then five goes into the pending
score but I don't score any points yet
now it's my turn again do I roll or do I
hold stop rolling and let's say I want
to roll again this time I get a two so I
add 2 to the pending score I get seven
let's say i roll again I'm lucky I get a
six I add 6 to the pending I get 13 and
I'm going great so I roll again and this
time I get a one and A one is special a
one is called a pig out and when you
roll a pig out it means you lose all the
pending points and for your hand you
score not this total but just the one so
my score would be just the one now the
other player player number one goes
let's say player number one says I gotta
roll gets a 3 i'm going to roll again
gets a 4 i'm going to roll again gets a
5 so now we have 12 in the pending and
now player number one says I think I've
had enough I'm going to hold and that
means we take these points from the
pending the 12 points put them up on the
board for player 1 score and now player
ones turn ends and its players eros turn
so your turn continues until you either
hold or pig out and your score for the
turn is the sum of your roles if you
didn't pick out if you decided to hold
and the score is just one if you pigged
out and you keep on taking turns until
somebody reaches the target here 50 so
that's how the game of pig works now
let's go to try to describe our the
in a form that we can program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
