problem at hand given a system of three
planes can we determine their unique
intersection point as we can see doing
just a few steps the algebra is going to
be a nightmare if we try to symbolically
solve for the solution also it's not
clear how generalize any formulas we end
up with two systems and higher
dimensions which we eventually like to
be able to solve instead is there some
sort of algorithm we can follow that
will always find the solution to a
linear system in fact there is the
algorithm we will follow is based on
three operations that will apply to the
equations in the system however before
we start trying to manipulate equations
let's think about what sort of
manipulations would be valid primarily
we don't want to do anything that would
change the geometry of the planes
represented by the equations and
therefore change the solution set also
we should be able to reverse the
operations we perform in order to obtain
the original pair of equations first of
all it's certainly legal at any time to
swap the order of two equations in the
system since intersections of planes
don't depend on the order in which we
list them this is perfectly fine we
don't change your solution set at all
also we can easily undo this operation
just by swapping the two equations back
to their original order
what's another type of operation we
could do well if we have an equation and
we multiply both sides of the equation
by the same number then the equation
will stay true however if we were to
multiply through by zero then the
operation would not be reversible we
would not be able to divide through by
zero to obtain the original equation so
we need to add a caveat we can multiply
an equation by any nonzero number now
does this operation preserve the
solution yes
multiplying through by a nonzero scalar
just multiplies the normal vector whose
coordinates are these coefficients by a
scalar so we'll be pointing in the same
direction moreover you can algebraically
verify that any point you select on the
original plane satisfies the new
equation and vice-versa so the two
planes consist of the same sets of
points ie
there
same also since we specify that alpha
must be a nonzero number the operation
is reversible simply by multiplying
through by 1 over alpha third if we have
two equations we can add one equation to
the other does this operation preserve
the solution set well suppose we had a
point XYZ that was in the intersection
of two planes in other words the point
XYZ satisfies both of these equations
now suppose we added the first equation
to the second equation this equation we
know to be true because it was assumed
true in the previous system in the new
second equation this quantity is equal
to k1 because of the first equation and
this quantity is equal to k2 because of
the second equation from the old system
therefore this new system is true as
well XYZ satisfies both of these
equations therefore XYZ is in the first
plane and in the new second plane which
means that the point XYZ is in the new
intersection of the two planes since
this is true for any point XYZ in the
old intersection it means that all of
the points in the old intersection are
contained in the new intersection also
because we can easily reverse this
operation by subtracting the first
equation from the second in the new
system
this means the new intersection does not
contain any points that weren't in the
old intersection so the intersections
are the same so the solution set is
preserved now suppose I modified the
operation so that instead of adding just
1 times the first equation to the second
I add an arbitrary amount alpha times
the first equation to the second
equation notice that the same logic I
applied earlier also holds in this case
so instead of just adding some equation
to another equation I can add a multiple
of one equation to another as I stated
earlier it's easy to reverse this
operation as well we just need to add
negative alpha times the first equation
to the second equation to get back to
the original system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
