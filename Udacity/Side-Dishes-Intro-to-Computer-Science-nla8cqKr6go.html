people think McDowell's mansion of meta
mead is a fairly one-dimensional
restaurant but they actually have not
only main dishes what we sometimes call
entrees although that means entry in the
u.s. I guess because it comes before
dessert or because Americans don't know
how to eat but in addition to main
dishes they have side dishes so this
means we want two different types we
want to type for representing a main
dish and we want to type for
representing an appetizer whether or not
you find fried Python appetizing is up
to you but the important differences are
a main dish can have slides an appetizer
doesn't have slides and a main dish is
designed to serve one person whereas an
appetizer may serve many people that
means we want to have an attribute for
an appetizer that indicates how many
people it serves we could try to
represent all of this with one dish type
but that could get kind of unwieldy we'd
have lots of code doing different things
depending on whether it's a main dish an
appetizer so instead we're going to
define separate classes one for
representing a main dish and one for
representing an appetizer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
