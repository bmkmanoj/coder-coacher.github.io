that's some amazing work with rationals
if you're getting it right you might
have been stumped on how to factor one
of these if so watch me do the first one
and then see if you can finish tackling
this problem to divide by any fraction
including a rational expression we
change division to multiplication and
multiply by the reciprocal of the first
fraction now we want to start factoring
each piece of these fractions I'm going
to start with this first one we know the
first two terms must be our since r
times r is r squared now we're just
trying to find factors of negative 12
that's sum to positive 1 since there's a
one in front of this R times s we know
positive 4 and negative 3 multiply to
give us negative 12 and some to give us
positive 1 but notice that i need a
negative 12x squared for my last term
this must mean that i need a variable of
s after each of these numbers we can
quickly check this factoring by
multiplying out the binomials in our
head r times r is r squared + 4 s times
negative 3 s is negative 12 s squared
this positive 1 RS comes from
multiplying these two terms together and
adding it to the result of multiplying
these two together so we have negative
three rs plus 4 RS which is one RS for
this first denominator we want to find
factors of negative twenty that sum to
negative one for our second fraction we
want to find factors of negative 30
that's some to one that would be
positive 6 and negative 5 and then for
our denominator of our second fraction
we want to find factors of negative
three that sum to negative two which are
negative 3 and positive one now that
everything's factored let's cancel our
terms in the numerator and denominator r
minus 3 s divided by r minus 3 s equals
1 and r plus 4 s divided by r plus 4 s
also equals one the last factor we need
to cancel is R minus 5 s and this leaves
us with our final answer r + 6 s divided
by r plus 1 s or just us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
