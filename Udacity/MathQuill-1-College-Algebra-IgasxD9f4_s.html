simplification it's time that I
introduce a new wonderful tool that's
called mathquill
Pascal is going to help format our
expressions that we write so they look
really beautiful when you type them in
that way you can make sure that what
you're typing is really what you want to
be typing that the expression that
you're writing is what you really want
to be entering this is mostly an issue
when it comes to exponents since there's
not an automatic exponent key on a
keyboard so for example if we want to
type X to the sixth then the keys they
need to hit are X Charat six now of
course in order to make a carrot you
might need to type different things
depending on what kind of keyboard you
have but you'll notice that when you
type the carrot the cursor in the box
will move up into the superscript spot
and you'll be able to type up here a
little 6 it's pretty cool then of course
if you want to get out of the
superscript position and back to writing
the rest of your expression in the
normal spot where you write numbers and
variables you need to type an arrow key
to move back down so if you want to type
x squared Y you'd need to type X Charat
2 but then to move from being up here to
being back down here you just use the
arrow key and then you can continue
typing here are a few things for you to
try out I've already I've already given
you some guidance on what to type for
these first two and then I'd like you to
figure it out for these last two however
it should be pretty easy to check if
you're doing it right because you want
what's in the box - just look exactly
like what's over here on the left so
just try these out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
