this is well-formed HTML we're beginning
the bold tag it ends after the word
really this looks great unfortunately in
this next sentence we end the bold
before we start it and then we started
over here with Eric Blair that's not
going to work out well and I will show
you in just a minute what that looks
like here we begin the bold tag and then
we have lots of space and then the word
really it turns out that is totally fine
web browsers use the same sort of
techniques we talked about in the last
unit to break up sentences like these
into words based on white space so all
this extra space doesn't matter and then
finally down here we start bold at the
beginning of the sentence so all of
these words George Orwell was really
Eric Blair they're all bolded so notably
really was bolted as well so this works
out let's go see how this plays out so
here we have the first option George
Orwell was really Eric Blair and really
is definitely bolded if I reverse these
it's harder to interpret this bold tag
closes nothing it's ill balance this
makes me super unhappy but this next one
applies to eric blair and then falls off
into the end of the universe this isn't
very good I can put huge numbers of
spaces here and as we see this does not
influence the rendered web page at all
and then in this version I have the tags
at the start in the end of the sentence
and the whole sentence is bolded George
Orwell is perhaps best known for writing
1984 and I hear that HTML has always
been at war with JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
