to do generalization and what we
generalize over well we generalize over
problems and so we're going to need
another problem and rather than have a
problem dealing with costs which we saw
were complicated
let's just do a problem where we're
finding the shortest path that is the
least number of steps to a solution and
so I'm going to choose a classic problem
called a missionaries and cannibals
problem and it works like this there's a
river we have to cross similar to the
bridge but this time it's a river and we
got a boat and on this side of the river
there are six people no flashlights but
a boat in six people and three of these
people our missionaries and three are
cannibals and the goal is to get
everybody over to the other side and
what makes it hard is that there are two
rules one at most two in the boat one
person can go in the boat and cross from
one side to the other but it takes
either one or two people to get the boat
from one side and to get it back and the
other rule is that we don't want the
cannibals eating the missionaries and if
we leave more cannibals than
missionaries on either side of the river
either on this side or over on this side
then the cannibals are going to gang up
and eat the missionaries and we won't be
able to accomplish getting everybody
across so we have to shuttle them back
and forth in such a way that this never
occurs now let's try to come up with a
good representation for a state one
possibility would be to have a set of
missionaries a set of cannibals and a
boat let's call that a boolean yes or no
saying what's on the starting side and
leaving out what's on the other side
because we can figure out that given
that we know we have three missionaries
if there's a set of two on one side than
the other side there must be one another
possibility is that we have three
integers the number of missionaries the
number of cannibals and the number of
boats that are on the starting side
these are all integers and then the
third possibility is that we have six
numbers the number of missionaries
cannibals and boats on the first side
and the number of each of those on the
other side may be subjective which of
these is
but I want you to tell me which of these
would be sufficient for representing
this state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
