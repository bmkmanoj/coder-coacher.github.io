process of classification much more
complicated this is as you would expect
an AI if it was an easy problem it would
not be part of a I the first factor that
makes this problem complicated is that
one data point might be explained by
multiple hypotheses so I go to the
doctor with high fever d5 here and
several hypotheses about different
diseases might explain my high fever
which of this hypothesis then is true a
second factor that complicated things is
that one hypothesis may explain multiple
sets of data so the hypothesis that a
shook has influenza might explain not
only that he has fever but also that he
feels tired and also that he's shivering
and also that he can't sleep at night
that is supposing they go to the doctor
with two data items one did have high
fever and the other that I am tired now
the doctor may come up with a hypothesis
is h3 that Ashok suffers from flu
however when x3 is present then one can
expect other symptoms to be observed as
well however the hypothesis of h3 may
generate expectations but additional
data items how then may a doctor decided
h3 is true well one possibility is that
the doctor may ask Ashok additional
questions to collect additional data do
you ship it at night the doctor may ask
if that is one of the expectations
generated by the hypothesis of having
flu does the mapping is not only from
the data space to the hypothesis space
the mapping is also from the hypothesis
space to data space diagnosis entails
not only mapping data to hypothesis but
also generate expectations of additional
data and collecting that additional data
of course both of the first two factors
may be present at the same time that is
one hypothesis may explain multiple data
items and multiple hypotheses who may
explain the same data item so in general
this is a m2n mapping multiple
hypotheses multiple sets of data and of
course this immediately makes a
diagnostic task hard on the fourth
factor that makes a diagnostic task hard
is that this hypothesis can interact
with each other one of the common
interactions between hypothesis is
called mutual exclusion mutual exclusion
workers when if
hypothesis is present another hypothesis
cannot be true in this case h3 explains
d2 d3 d4 and h6 explains d of six D of 7
d of eight but if HP is present 86
cannot be true and if s6 is present h3
cannot be true this place a diagnostic
task hard because if a patient goes to a
doctor with symptoms d3 d4 and d6 d7
then the question becomes whether to
include h3 or to include at six in the
final conclusion a fifth factor that
makes the diagnostic tracks hard is
called cancellation cancellation occurs
when two hypotheses interact relative to
a particular data item as an example i
may have flu which tends to increase the
temperature but i'm also have a lowered
immune function which tends not to show
higher temperature as a result i may not
show higher fever but it's not because I
don't have flu it's much more because
the symptoms of flu and the symptoms of
lowered immune function are cancelling
out each other so we also saw this in
our initial exercise we chose theta
desus as the most parsimonious
hypothesis for these data but imagine if
we didn't have that as an option if we
didn't have theta thesis we may have
said that it's beta ptosis iota LJ and
Kappa side because the elevated a we see
an iota algea cancels out the reduced
day we see in Kappa side which would
account for our normal a levels in
general consummation interactions are
very hard to account for an order to
address these factors that make
diagnosis or complex that is useful to
shift from the perspective of diagnosis
solely as classification to a
perspective of diagnosis as abduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
