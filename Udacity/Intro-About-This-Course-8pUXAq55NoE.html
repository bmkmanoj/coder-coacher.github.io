shell i'm philip and in this course
you'll learn the basics of how to use
the linux shell or command line
environment and I'm Carl the goal of
this course is to give you the basic
command-line tools you'll need to start
working with Linux servers now you might
have used other command lines before if
you've used JavaScript you've probably
seen the JavaScript console in your
browser or maybe you've used an
interpreter in Python or another
language or perhaps you've used the
command line on your own computer these
are all examples of command line
interfaces command line interface is all
working about the same way you type in a
command then the system runs those
commands and displays the output then
you can type another command and so on
and the idea of a command line interface
goes back to the mid twentieth century
and one of the earliest ways that people
had for communicating with a computer
the computer terminal now today terminal
usually means a piece of software but it
originally meant a physical piece of
hardware for interacting with a computer
before terminals people put programs and
data through computers using punch cards
loading a batch of data into the
computer all at once the terminal by
letting a user directly send commands to
a computer program and immediately see
responses was a huge step forward and
user interface and it's an interface
that we're still using today for a lot
of reasons a command-line interface is
programmable it's efficient in terms of
network bandwidth and you can use the
terminal edit files in a distant system
without having to first copy them to
your local machine in general you can be
much more expressive with a text-based
interface and you can't by just pointing
and clicking one of the uses of the
shells to administer servers machines
that might be far away on the network
and there probably don't have a
graphical environment for the rest of
this course you're going to be working
on a system very much like that so first
you only need to set up your own virtual
linux server to work on fortunately
that's a lot easier than it sounds like
so let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
