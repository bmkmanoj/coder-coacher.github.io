mentioned nearsightedness now what did
you mean by that so people who are
nearsighted have a hard time seeing
things that are far away they can only
see things that are closed or near to
them so any are you near-sighted either
yes when I take my glasses off I really
can't see a thing so why does that
happen but before we can do that what we
learn a little bit more about the eye so
let's take a look at this diagram okay
well I've definitely seen this before
can you tell the viewers at home what's
going on okay so this is our eye in the
job of the eye is basically to take
light which enters here and focus it on
to the back of the eye back here is it
kind of how a magnifying glass focuses
light yeah sorta now a properly
functioning I with good vision will take
light that enters and Bend that light or
focus it on to the back of the eye here
which is called the retina and what
about an eye that's not functioning so
well one that case the lens this part
here that actually bent the light and
focused it isn't doing its job right in
people who are what's called nearsighted
the light actually gets bent too much by
the lens so maybe the focusing point
would be somewhere here which is not
where the retina is so this results in
blurry vision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
