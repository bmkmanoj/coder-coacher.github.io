deployment in a dual stack deployment a
host can speak both ipv4 and ipv6 it
communicates with an ipv4 host using
ipv4 and communicates with an ipv6 host
using ipv6 what this means is that the
dual stack host has to have an ipv4
compatible address either the host has
both an ipv4 and an ipv6 address thus
allowing it to speak to an ipv4 host or
it must rely on a translator which knows
how to take a v4 compatible ipv6 address
and translate it to the v4 address one
possible way of ensuring compatibility
of a v6 address with ipv4 is simply to
embed the ipv4 address in 32 bits of the
128 that are allocated for the ipv6
address now a dual stack host
configuration or a v4 compatible ipv6
address solves the problem of host IP
address assignment but it doesn't solve
the problem that ipv6 deployments might
exist as Islands for example multiple
independent portions of the internet
might deploy ipv6 but what if the middle
of the network only speaks and routes
ipv4 when the solution here is to use
what's called 6to4 tunneling and 6to4
tunneling a v6 packet is encapsulated in
a v4 packet now that v4 packet is routed
to a particular v4 to v6 gateway
corresponding to the v6 address that
lies behind that gateway and at this
point the outer layer of encapsulation
can be stripped and the v6 packet can be
sent to its destination this of course
requires the gateways at the boundaries
between the v4 and v6 networks to
perform encapsulation of the packet as
it enters the v4 only part of the
network and decapsulation as the packet
enters the v6 island where the
destination host resides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
