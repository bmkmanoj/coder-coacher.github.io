to know is how many moons can fit into
the earth shadow how many moon widths
are their associated with this time
spent in eclipse well two hundred five
minutes is 3.4 two hours now I have this
conversion factor here which relates
hours to moon width so why don't I use
that 3.4 two hours times well now I want
to invert this because I want the hours
to cancel out so this guy's got to go
downstairs so x 1 moon width / 0.93
hours hours cancels sorry this should
have been a 2 and this equals 3.68 moon
widths since we said the shadow was the
same size as the earth well this is
equal to one earth width let's divide
this by 3.68 because I want to know what
one moon with this and I find it's one
earth with / 3.68 so the moon is three
point six eight times smaller than the
earth I don't actually want width I want
circumference so let's go over here and
say the moon circumference MC is equal
to well one earth circumference divided
by three point six eight so that's going
to be 40,000 km that's the earth's
circumference divided by three point six
eight and the circumference of the moon
is about ten thousand nine hundred
kilometers great work this is really
amazing you've calculate this ur comes
to the earth and the circumference of
the moon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
