conditions in Java those conditions that
he can put inside an if statement to
make a decision oftentimes you want to
compare two values to see which one is
smaller which one is larger and there
are a bunch of operators that you can
use here's a list of them a couple of
them look just like what they look in
regular mathematics the others look
slightly different this one here you
would write as greater than or equal or
maybe greater than or equal like that in
math this one here is a less than or
equal this one here is a simple equality
and this one here is a not equal of
course these three symbols were chosen
because there's no keyboard character
for the mathematical symbols the equal
equal on the other hand was chosen
because the plain old equal already has
another meaning in Java you use the
equal equal for comparison and a single
equal sign for assignment if you want to
assign a value to a variable here we
want to assign the number 13 to the
variable floor then we use the equal
sign and of course afterwards floors 13
if on the other end we want to test
whether or not floor equals 13 then we
use the equal equal comparison symbol
let's put if statements and relational
operators to use in a fun graphical way
to draw flags here you see the flag of
Indonesia as simple as flags get right
on top white on the bottom here you see
the outline of a simple class for
drawing a flag it's get color add method
gets called for every x and y value in
the flag and your job will be to
complete it so that the correct colors
appear you'll want to know the
dimensions of the flag so that you can
decide when to use red and when to use
white and they're available to you in
these instance variables don't worry
about how to get color add method is
called you can actually pick the low and
see it but it uses loops which we're
only introduced in the next lesson right
now your job is to fill out this method
here put in a condition here select the
right colors and as an added challenge I
want you to use the greater equal
operator now be careful for exactly half
of Thoreau's you want red and for
exactly half of the rose you want white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
