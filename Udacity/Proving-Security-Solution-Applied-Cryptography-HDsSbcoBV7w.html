is the best possibility is that we do
have a mathematical proof that follows
standard rules of deduction that shows
that the cipher is secure and there are
very few ciphers that we can actually
get that for one actually is the
one-time pad and we'll see that later
this unit how to prove in a mathematical
sense that it has a very strong security
property the next best one is the last
one which is a show in a formal way why
this cipher is as least as hard as some
other problem and we'll talk about
reduction proofs more later in this
course
the basic premise here is that there's
some other problem that we have good
reasons to believe is always already
hard and then we're going to show that
if we could break the cipher we could
solve that other problem that we already
have good reasons to believe this hard
the next best is this one that many
smart highly motivated people tried to
break it but couldn't this is often the
best we can do and for the best
symmetric ciphers that are in use today
this is really the reason that they're
argued to cure there may be formal
arguments that show why they resist
particular attacks and that's part of
smart people trying to break ciphers is
knowing all the known best case attacks
and trying them against the cipher and
seeing that the cipher resists them but
ultimately the best we can do is show
that well we think it's secure because
it has these properties and lots of
smart people weren't able to break it
but that's not a very satisfying way to
know it's secure we'd certainly much
rather have the strong mathematical
proof the worst possible argument here
is the key space argument and this one
is often made incorrectly the number of
queues gives you an upper bound on the
difficulty to break the cipher because
at worst the attacker could try all the
keys that's not true for the one-time
pad as we saw trying keys gives you
perfectly sensible messages that you'll
eventually see all possible messages so
you can't know which key is correct but
for our ciphers where the key space is
smaller than the message space you could
try keys and have a good likelihood if
the key leads to a sensible message that
that's the right message so this gives
you an upper bound on how hard it is to
break a cipher it doesn't give you a
lower bound the fact that you have a
large number of possible keys doesn't
mean the cypher secure we can always add
to the key space without increasing the
difficulty
breaking a cipher so we'll see many
ciphers with very large key spaces that
are completely insecure so our best
possible argument is to have a
mathematical proof and that's what
Claude Shannon was able to do for the
one-time pad and it's really a fairly
unusual case where we can get a
mathematical proof that's that strong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
