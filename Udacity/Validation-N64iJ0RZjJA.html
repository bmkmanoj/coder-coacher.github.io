out form faster by well not filling out
anything but now I want you to think
about your users confidence with good
validation features with validation you
can ensure that users know that there
are filling forms with the right
information more importantly validation
can ensure that the users fill out form
correctly the first time they won't
waste time leaving an input and
submitting a form only to find out a few
seconds later that they forgot a digit
in their zip code with validation you
are giving your users and real-time
feedback and minimizing errors I want to
choose and use password and like in any
good website I have a few rules that I
need to enforce here while I'm typing
you could see that I'm using lower case
and now I understand that I need an
upper case as well I need few numbers
and I just pass the minimum length of
eight characters I'm adding some
punctuation and only then I'm enabling
the next button it's worth adding that
html5 validation or any front and
validation for that matter is not a
replacement for a server side validation
your websites are obviously not safe
unless you validate on your back end to
the approach cam and I are discussing is
just a way to improve the user
experience and to put a big smile on the
faces in the next video I'll show you
how to use html5 attributes for
validation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
