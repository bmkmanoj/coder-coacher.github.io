programs already and that's great but
one capability that was lacking so far
was to be able to ask the user to supply
input here's how you do it in Java just
like you use system dot out for output
you use system dot in to get input from
the user but as it turns out system dot
in is not very smart and to really read
numbers and strings from the keyboard
you use an object of this scan or class
you construct a scanner with a new
operator a new scanner and this is a
scanner that can read from system dot it
usually you want to read more than one
input so it makes sense to save the
scanner in a variable here it is called
in and of course it's of type scanner
then when the time has come to read
something you call one of them methods
of the scanner class here I call the
next inch method it reads an integer
that the user types in and returns it
and here I'm saving that integer in the
age variable so you should think of a
scanner kind of like a supermarket
scanner except the supermarket scanner
of course reads a barcode and our
scanner here read something from the
user and also produces some number the
program snippet that I've written here
is not quite complete
after all how's the user supposed to
know that they're now asked for their
age so before calling a scanner method
that reads user input you always want to
alert the user first with a statement
such as this one this string here how
old are you is called a prompt string it
prompts the user to then take the next
step and provide an input note that with
the prompt string we put a blank space
here that just looks prettier so that
the users input is a little bit
separated when you print the prompt it
looks prettier when both the prompt and
the user input are on the same line
that's why we're using print and not
print on here and then you want to have
a blank space to separate the prompt
from the user input here we write an
integer you can also read a decimal
number by calling next double that
returns a double and again you would
then want to capture it in a variable
let me
in bluej so you can see what it looks
like before you get to try it yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
