activity lifecycle callbacks I created a
new project named lifecycle and I use
the empty activity template and in here
I started modifying the main activity
file so I went through and overrode each
of the major activity lifecycle methods
on create on start on resume on pause
and so on and here I'll give you an
example of how I did that now on my
version of Android studio I have a
keyboard shortcut to pull up the
override method menu so I've ctrl o and
pulls up this list of methods that I can
override for here I want to choose on
stop click OK and that pulls in the
method for me so Android studio
automatically help me add the method
into my app now within each method I'm
gonna call a superclass version of the
method this will execute the
instructions within the onstop method of
the app compat activity and remember
that's the class that we overrode so
this superclass is the one that does the
real work in terms of showing the window
on the screen and other
behind-the-scenes stuff that makes the
activity work so whenever you override a
lifecycle method be sure to call the
superclass version of that method first
now after this line we can add in our
own logic when I add in a line of code
that prints out a log message with the
name of the method as well as what
activity lifecycle method is hit so once
the app is running on my device the
activity immediately launches and I can
check the logs and see that on create on
start and the on resume methods have
been called now when I hit the home
button the activity is no longer visible
so the on pause and the on stop method
should have been called and here they
are in the logs so we're doing good now
if I go back into my app
then the unstart and unn resume methods
get called and then the activity is now
active and I can interact with it
alright so I know that was a lot of
information to take in and it might be a
hard concept to grasp at first but don't
worry as you see more scenarios of this
app and future apps you'll learn how to
better manage the activity lifecycle and
if you like to experiment with activity
lifecycle methods I've linked the code
that we've looked at here down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
