lobotomy and its overuse today's psycho
surgeries are only used as a last resort
after all other therapies have proven to
be uneffective ect is administered by
passing an electrical current through
the brain in order to induce a seizure
and ect is administered by placing
electrodes on the head and passing that
electrical current through for
approximately one third to half a second
and the voltage ranges between 60 and
140 volts now this voltage is not lethal
because it's delivered to the head
however if that voltage were delivered
to the chest it would be lethal early in
its use ECT often produced fractures
because a person was experiencing
seizure and convulsions therefore today
patients are given a muscle relaxant and
an anesthetic before the ECT is
administered thus what was once a
violent procedure due to the convulsions
shaking and broken bones
now all the results in a slight tremor
because of the muscle relaxant
now it may typically take at least six
to twelve sessions at ECT before a
person is relieved with our depressive
symptoms in addition after ECT treatment
many patients are relieved of their
depressive symptoms which they did not
experience with other treatments now the
exact mechanism of action or cause of
why ECT is effective is still not known
and research continues in that area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
