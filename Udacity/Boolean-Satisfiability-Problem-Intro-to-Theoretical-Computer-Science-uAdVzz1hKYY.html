so sad stands for boolean satisfiability
of course that also doesn't tell you
very much but I'll soon get into what
boolean satisfiability is you should
just note that Sat is one of the most
famous and most studied problems in
theoretical computer science and it's
the basis of many Denmark results so
it's always a good idea to familiarize
yourself with what sad is about and and
why sad can be so hard to solve so what
is the boolean satisfiability problem
the input for Sat is a so-called boolean
formula and that actually sounds much
more intimidating than it is because
boolean formulas are very simple
structures they consist of only four
building blocks as any kind of formula
we have variables and those variables
I'll write in this course usually as X 1
X 2 X 3 and so on and the nice thing
about these variables is so in a normal
formula whenever you have X that can
take a number of different values but in
a boolean formula a variable X can only
take two different values it can either
be true which is sometimes also written
as a 1 or it can be false
which is sometimes also written as a 0
the second thing you can have in a
boolean formula is an operator called
not and how you write that is if you say
have a variable X 1 then this here would
be not X 1 or if you have X 2 this year
would be not X 2 and what the knot does
is it turns a true and to a false and
vice versa so it also turns a false into
a true so for example if X 1 equals true
then not X 1 equals false so basically
just flips that variable then you have
another operator and that one is called
end and this end is usually written like
this and it works on two variables so
you have X 1 and X 2 or any other
variable and the way it works is that
this expression here X 1 and X 2 is true
only if
x1 is true and x2 is true otherwise it's
always false so I'm going to write this
as ones and zeros here just to make it a
bit shorter but you know that one stands
for true and zero stands for false so
it's it's the same so 0 + 0 equals 0 0 +
1 equals 0 1 + 0 equals 0 and only 1 + 1
equals 1 and the final component of a
boolean formula is another operator
called or and or is written just the
other way around senses it's written
like a flipped end so it's x1 or x2 and
as the name already suggests that is set
to true or set to 1 if at least one of
these variables here is set to true so 0
or 0 that will still be 0 but 0 or 1
will be 1 1 or 0 will be 1 and 1 or 1 is
also going to evaluate to 1 so let's
practice this in a little quiz let's say
you have the following boolean formula
x1 or not x2 or x3 and not x1 or x2 and
we're going to have that x1 is equal to
true or 1 X 2 is equal to true and x3 is
also set to true or 1 is this whole
formula equal to true or is it equal to
false so please select this button here
if you think the whole formula is equal
to false or 0 and please select this one
here if the whole formula is equal to 2
or 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
