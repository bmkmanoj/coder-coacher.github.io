of the earth that's a huge
accomplishment but now let's move on
let's calculate the size of the moon
here I've drawn a little diagram of
what's going on with the earth the moon
and the Sun now keep in mind this is not
to scale at all in fact the Sun should
be way way way bigger and way way way
further off the screen in fact if I drew
this right these rays would all be more
or less completely parallel so the idea
behind measuring the size of the moon is
we can exploit the fact that lunar
eclipses occur now what's the lunar
eclipse well here's the Sun and here are
a few of its rays which I've traced and
you can see that if you were in your
spaceship flying around over here or
here or there you would be illuminated
you would be in the sun's rays and
everything would be bright and wonderful
as soon as you got behind the Earth
however things get dark you're in the
Earth's shadow the same thing happens to
the moon what we want to do is figure
out how big is the moon compared to the
earth since we know the size of the
earth already can we fit one to three
moons in one earth shadow if that were
the case then the moon would be
one-third the size of the earth or is it
two moons in the Earth's shadow or seven
or twelve I don't know let's figure that
out so how are we gonna answer this
question how many moons fit in the earth
shadow all we're going to do it's time
how long the moon spends in the earth
shadow how long we can't see it for
during a total lunar eclipse the longer
time it spends the smaller the moon is
compared to the earth once I know how
much time the moon spends in the earth
shadow I can convert that into moon
widths let's call it and so what do I
mean by a moon width I mean this
distance here that's one moon width so
we have to know how long does it take
the moon to move from here over to here
to move one moon width in its orbit we
can answer that by noting the fact that
the moon has an angular size in the sky
of about half a degree and so what do I
mean by that if you're standing on earth
and if you first look at the top of the
moon then look at the bottom of the moon
this angle here is 0.5 degrees
we also know that it takes 28 days for
one complete orbit so in 28 days it's
gone 360 degrees so that means it's gone
720 moon widths since each width is only
half a degree in 720 is twice 360 which
means 28 days per 720 moon widths and if
we do some unit conversion that works
out to be 0.9 three hours for one moon
width so every 0.9 3 hours the moon has
moved one width over so it's gone from
here to here or from here to here etc
now I'm just going to give you the data
I'm going to tell you what we can
observe and you're gonna have to do some
thinking and probably some unit
conversion to answer this question the
observed fact is the following the moon
spends 205 minutes in Eclipse and what
do I mean for the moon to be in eclipse
well we start the Eclipse timer when the
moon is completely in the Earth's shadow
and end it just as its leaving the
Earth's shadow
ok so we know the moon takes 0.9 three
hours to go one moon width and we know
it spends 205 minutes and eclipse and we
know Earth's circumference is equal to
40,000 kilometers now I think you can
answer the question not how many moons
fit in their shadow do it one step
better what is the circumference of the
moon and your answer here in kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
