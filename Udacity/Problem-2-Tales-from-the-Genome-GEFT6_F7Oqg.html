sequence here at the top we're given
four different versions of this sequence
we need to classify these as silent
missense nonsense or frameshift mutation
so this is from a coding region right so
we're going to expect some differences
if any two amino acids notice we start
with an atg which would be Aug in the
RNA code right which would code for a
methionine which is the start codon so
here if we were to look 80 GGG a CTA gtt
right that's what's different instead of
GA T we have gtt and if we look at the
genetic code the code on table will see
that this would be a missense mutation
it changes the amino acid aspartate to
glutamate I let's look at the next one
we've got 80 g is the same ggt up
there's the difference theorem instead
of GGA we have ggt and it turns out this
is glycine and this is glycine so
there's no change so this is what we
would call a silent mutation now we have
80 g CGA so instead of GG a way of CGA
so instead of glycine GGA we have
arginine CGA so this would be another
example of a missense mutation and for
our last example we have a TG g g a CTA
and then AG a we've changed it but what
we've done is we've kept the sequence
down here we just insert it in a and
this is going to cause a huge frame
shift in the coding region we need a lot
of different amino acids from the new
codons are going to be read now because
of this one single letter insertion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
