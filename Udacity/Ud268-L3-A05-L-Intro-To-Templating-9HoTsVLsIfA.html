far has been completely static meaning
that it doesn't change its all pre-built
files that were sending back to the user
as is without any alterations remember
our chef in the kitchen actually we've
exhausted our kitchen analogy so I'm
thinking we can try something new hi I'm
your sinatra application but not really
i'm still cold i just put on this hat
and i'm a client who is making requests
to the Sinatra app when the client here
request one of my static pages I don't
really have to do any work it's so easy
I just hand her a pre-existing ready to
go HTML page watch this hi application
can I please have a contact page oh sure
thing there you go every time someone
asks for that content all I have to do
is give them that exact page that's
great for things like a personal web
page or a restaurant menu site but it's
not really useful for creating complex
web apps let's contrast the process for
a dynamic web app like Google News hi
implication can I have the Google News
homepage please oh yes a good one hang
on just a moment I need to build this
page from scratch for you
uh are you logged in currently yes
what's your username Julia yeah all
right
here you go client Google News homepage
custom built so how do we accomplish
this with something called templating
there are a bunch of different template
anguishes out there that allow you to
write these dynamic pages and we're
going to focus on one called ER be
embedded Ruby it allows us to do just
that embed Ruby code in an HTML file
soon enough you'll see how you can write
your own ARB files the hybrid HTML files
that contain Ruby logic things like if
statements and loops and more to
generate awesome dynamic pages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
