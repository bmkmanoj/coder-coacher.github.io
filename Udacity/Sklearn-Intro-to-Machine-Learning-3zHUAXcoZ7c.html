k-means clustering to you I'm going to
show you how to use the scikit-learn
implementation to deploy it in your own
studies so I start over here at Google
and I find that there's a whole page on
clustering in scikit-learn the first
thing that I notice when I get to this
page is that there are many types of
clustering besides just k-means
clustering so all of these different
columns right here are different types
of clustering we won't go into all of
these instead I want to use this page to
navigate to the k-means documentation
that you can get a little bit of a
better idea of how this is handled in
scikit-learn so here's a list of all the
different clustering methods that I have
and here the first item on the list we
see is k-means and some summary
information about the algorithm so one
of the parameters that you have to
define for k-means is the number of
clusters remember we had to say at the
outset how many clusters we want to look
for and this is one of the things that
can be most challenging actually about
using k-means is deciding how many many
clusters you want to try then it gives
us some information about the
scalability which basically tells us how
the algorithm performs as you start to
have lots and lots of data or lots of
clusters a use case which gives us a
little bit of information that this is
good for general purpose when you have
clusters that have even number of points
of them and so on and last that the way
that k-means clustering works is based
on the distances between the points so
very consistent with what we've seen so
far let's dig in a little bit deeper now
we're at the k-means documentation page
and there are three parameters in
particular that I want to call your
attention to the first and most
important one is n clusters the default
value for n clusters is 8 but of course
we know that the number of clusters in
the algorithm is something that you need
to set on your own based on what you
think makes sense this might even be a
parameter that you play around with so
you should always be thinking about
whether you actually want to use this
default value or if you want to change
it to something else I can guarantee you
that you're mostly going to want to
change it to something else
the second parameter that I want to call
your attention to is max it or equals
300 remember that when we're running
k-means clustering we have an iteration
that we go through as we're finding the
clusters where we assign each point to a
centroid and then we move the centroid
then we assign the points again we move
the centroids again
and each one of those assign and move
assign and move steps is an iteration of
the algorithm and so max it er actually
says how many iterations of the
algorithm do you want it to go through
300 will usually be a very reasonable
value for you in fact most of the time I
would guess that it's going to terminate
before it gets to this maximum number
but if you want to have a finer level of
control over the algorithm and how many
times it goes through that iteration
process this is the parameter that you
want and then the last parameter that
I'll mention another one that's very
important is the number of different
initializations that you give it
remember we said that k-means clustering
has this challenge that depending on
exactly what the initial conditions are
you can sometimes end up with different
clusterings and so then you want to
repeat the algorithm several times so
that any one of those clusterings might
be wrong but in general the ensemble of
all the clusterings
will give you something that makes sense
that's what this parameter controls is
basically how many times does it
initialize the algorithm how many times
does it come up with clusters you can
see that by default it goes through it
ten times if you think for some reason
that your clustering might be
particularly prone to bad
initializations or challenging
initializations then this is the
parameter that you want to change maybe
bump the number of initializations up to
a higher number but again just to
reiterate of all those parameters number
of clusters is definitely the one that's
the most important and that you should
be playing around with and thinking
really hard about the most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
