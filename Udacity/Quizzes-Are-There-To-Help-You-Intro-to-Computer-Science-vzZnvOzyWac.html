get started right away with questions
okay so let's start with Katherine from
New Hampshire she says I believe that
there were at least one or two instances
where he gave up in frustration and
viewed as solution before getting a
correct answer in a unit quiz she wants
to know what do the unit quizzes mean
should be should she be concerned she
gets it right
she should be frustrated if she's
getting them wrong okay so I hope people
aren't frustrated on the unit quizzes
the quizzes in the units are really
there to help keep you engaged to help
you learn if you can't get the answer
that's okay that we do have answers
recorded after them you're not being
graded on the quizzes they're really
there to help you learn some of the
quizzes are harder than others and one
of the things that we do in the quizzes
they're rated with gold starts so
definitely the ones that have stars you
shouldn't be surprised if you're not
necessarily able to answer those those
are questions that will require a lot of
thought
especially for beginning students those
are gonna be really hard but those are
questions that I hope by thinking about
them maybe you'll be able to solve it
yourself if you're not able to solve it
yourself don't get frustrated
you can watch the answer hopefully
you'll understand the answer and then
maybe you'll be able to try it on your
own again after you've seen the answer
but the quizzes don't count towards your
grade you shouldn't be frustrated or
stressed about them they're really there
to help you learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
