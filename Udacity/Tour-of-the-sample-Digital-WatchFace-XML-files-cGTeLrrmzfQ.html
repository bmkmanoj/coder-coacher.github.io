once you've created the necessary
services and activities you need to
register them in the androidmanifest.xml
so that Android wear on the phone and
wearable side knows that you have watch
faces to select from let's have a look
at the wearable Android XML file first
firstly you need to request provide
background and wakelock permissions you
need to do this on the phone side as
well since the phone app must always
request every permission needed by the
wearable let's now look at the service
definitions in the manifest you can see
that each watch face has a unique
service entry let's look at the
definition of digital watch face service
you'll notice we've declared our service
given it a human readable name and
specified bind wallpaper for permissions
the first item we have inside here is
Android service dog wallpaper this needs
to refer to a watch face dot XML file
and when we look at the declaration it
looks like this you can see here there's
a wallpaper element declared here next
we have the preview and preview circular
attributes these are used to define
images that will be shown as previews on
the companion or watch when selecting a
watch face you can see that if we right
click and go the declaration this is
what it looks like you can specify a
separate image for round displays if you
have a different layout and if you don't
provide one it will fall back to the
square one you can create these images
by just taking a screenshot of your
watch face running on a device or
emulator we also have a companion
configuration action which specifies if
we'll be providing an activity on the
phone companion side to configure the
watch face this enables the little gear
icon on the phone side that we tried
earlier we create a unique name here
with their own package name and target
config digital we also have a wearable
configuration action which specifies
will be providing an activity to run on
the wearable to configure the watch face
this enables the little gear icon on the
wearable side to make changes we use the
same unique name as the phone companion
configuration action earlier we also
declare an intent filter for a wallpaper
service with a category of watch face
like here to complete the definition of
our service finally we need to declare
our digital watch face wearable config
activity which is the activity will run
if a user wants to configure this watch
face we need to add an intent filter
that includes the default and wearable
configuration categories for the watch
face picker to see this activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
