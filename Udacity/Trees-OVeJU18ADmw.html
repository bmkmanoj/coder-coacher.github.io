collect a lot of their water from fog
and in the process they help keep the
surrounding environment wet if we were
here in the morning with a lot of fog in
the air
you'd be able to see water droplets
beating on leaves and then dripping down
to the ground anyway the reason I want
to show you trees is because they play a
key role in web development besides
being beautiful or inspiring giants web
developers use them to represent the
data that makes up websites here let me
show you what I mean this is a family
tree you've probably seen something like
this before there's a parent and two
children and yeah I know it takes two
parents to make a kid but just ignore
that for now pretend it only takes one
parent for this family you would say
that Diego and Jamal are children of
julissa and you would say that jalisa is
the parent to Jamal and Diego you could
also say that Diego and Jamal are
siblings we use the same kind of family
terms like child siblings and parent to
describe relationships like these inside
a data tree now a tree is just a type of
data in computer science there used to
represent hierarchical data that is to
say bits of information that belonged to
each other in this case element 3 and
element 2 both belong to element 1 and
just like a family the children can be
parents too and that's it that's a tree
I brought this tree up because your HTML
turns into a tree a lot like this one
elements will belong to each other or be
descended from one another there are
children and parents and children have
children now I know that can sound a
little confusing so here let me show you
what I mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
