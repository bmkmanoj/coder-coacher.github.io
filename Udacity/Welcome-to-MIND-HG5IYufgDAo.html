learning engineer nanodegree program my
name is David jr. I'm a course developer
with Udacity as well as an instructor
over at Georgia Tech and I'm thrilled to
bring you this program because machine
learning is really at the core of many
innovations going on in lots of
different areas finance education health
care these are all industries that are
being revolutionized every day about
what machine learning can do and in this
nano degree program you're going to
develop your own understanding of what
machine learning can do for these areas
as well over the course of this program
you're going to be covering the major
schools of thought and machine learning
you're going to be using the same tools
the same methods the same algorithms
that experts are using every day to
uncover new information about different
industries by the end of this program
you'll developed a portfolio that
demonstrates what you can do the kinds
