and the reading input from a form and
then generating a query trip generating
the query let's do an example based on
that so let's say this web application
is running and user is going to provide
input the input they provide let's say
is the city Redmond so if that's the
case the script is going to generate the
query that says select star from orders
table if you go back and look at the
code where basically it's going to
replace the placeholder that we had for
ship city by this input that was just
provided by the user the script is
generating this and this is what is
going to get submitted to the database
now let's get to what kind of mischief
user who's malicious may do so what if
the user instead of providing Redmond is
going to provide something that says
Redmond code semicolon drop table orders
table drop this is the particular table
that we're talking about what if they
entered this whole thing okay so before
we you know look at this may be a little
bit of SQL here so semicolon separates
statement so this will say this
statement will end here and the next
statement is the drop table orders table
and drop results in basically assuming
that you have access to do that deletion
of this particular table so what
happened here is that the user is
actually entering lot more input than
what we expect which is just a city name
so what happens when the user actually
provides this as input they're injecting
this SQL injection that we are talking
about you will see where the name now
comes from in this case the query that
we're going to generate it's going to be
this actually so what this is what we
got before this is what we're going to
get now because here we're going to
replace the subsidy variable value that
we read is this one so now essentially
we giving the database this query and
now you can see what really has happened
here the malicious user that we have is
able to inject code to delete the table
and that is what we see here after the
semicolon you say drop orders table and
that's what we generate
and this will result in deletion off
this table so this is the injection with
injecting code through input that is
normally expected by the web application
the Warner ability we have in the web
application is that it's not checking
input obviously it is accepting this
input for a cities where the item is
shipped getting a name of course but it
also there's a lot more stuff that comes
after that it is accepting this input
and this input is not correct input when
we looking for just a city name so by
providing this input it's able to inject
malicious code to drop the table or to
delete the table which is going to
impact its integrity and that's actually
a concrete example of what SQL
injections are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
