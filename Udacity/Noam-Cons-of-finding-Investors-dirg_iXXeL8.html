carefully probably is carefully that you
want to pick your your co-founders
because while you can pass on a
co-founder it's very hard to perform an
investor he have money he put money in
your hole in your company and the money
is gone and what now it will be very
hard to buy him out so you need to make
sure that you're working with someone
that you're taking money from someone
you can work with and you can learn form
and can bring actual value to you in
your company because if you're walking
with someone who just can't bring you
money yet does this horrific expression
friends Falls and family and what is
fools like you're taking money from from
a fall like it's so bad it's like it's
either getting the entrepreneur
conscious ending that yeah I'll take
money from that fool or you're taking
money from someone who can't help you
it's it's horrible and it makes sense of
inner seems stupid so never take my
phone for try not to take money from
family also and not from friends I I
hate that expression for family it's
horrific but choosing the right investor
can make or break your company because
like a bed investor that try to
micromanage the company and try to
micromanage you and demands explanations
and wants to be involved in everything
can really make make you miserable and
if you're not experienced you don't know
how to put him in his place and it can
make your life really very hard the good
investor can make your company it can
help you do everything but a bed
investor and there's more bad investors
then good investors can really hurt you
and there's not enough money in the
world to to make this work life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
