information it's time to turn to the
next crucial part in the study of memory
and that's our ability to retrieve the
information that we've stored so
retrieval is our ability to recall
information that's previously been
stored in our memories remember we
talked about two different types of
memory explicit and implicit and with
implicit memory we can recall something
without consciously trying to do so I
like to tell my students an example of
me trying to learn how to knit I looked
at books and try and try to follow their
examples to no avail so I ended up
taking a lesson and I had a teacher who
showed me how to hold the knitting
needles how to hold the yarn and more
importantly how to wrap it around such
that i can make a knit stitch so i
practice and practice my knitting and i
made several scarves and then summer
came and I put my knitting away now as
Christmas got closer I thought it'd be
really nice if I could make each of my
niece as a scarf and then I realized I
forgotten all the rules that my teacher
taught me but I did remember what I know
about memory and so I thought just maybe
if I pick up those knitting needles my
hands will remember what to do and
that's exactly what happened I picked up
my needles and I started knitting so
this is a good example of implicit
memory and more importantly procedural
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
