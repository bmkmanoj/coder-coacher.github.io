and see what they did with customer
segments now what happened is they got
out of the building and this time I
actually spoke to a series of customers
he smoked over 60 and what they found
out was what they originally thought was
a single customer segment actually
turned out to be there were two separate
segments it turned out there were the
original segments they thought rabid
sports Jersey owners who were male 13 to
35 who passionately followed their team
and went to a lot of games but there
were also people who casually attended
games male and female and they kind of
work closer to 18 to 30 and they were
casual fans so number one is you can now
see that there are not only two customer
segments but there are two value
propositions that is there's a value
proposition that matches each one of the
segments and there's a revenue stream
that matches each one of the segments
and so now you could kind of see the
power of the canvas this is a
multi-sided market you have at least two
customer segments and you have to value
props and attendant revenue streams now
you should notice what the Jersey square
team done wonderfully well they actually
started with the archetype the archetype
though if you remember is kind of the
end result of understanding the pain in
the game we were solving with the value
proposition so they really were missing
talking about gains and pains over here
as well and it would have been great if
they had that added in but not pretty
good job in trying to understand what
their archetype was which needed to
match their Minimum Viable Product over
