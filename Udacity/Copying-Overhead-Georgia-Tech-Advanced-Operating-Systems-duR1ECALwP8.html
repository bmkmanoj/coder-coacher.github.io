talking about in this client-server
interaction and RPC call is a serious
concern in RPC design why because this
copying happens every time you have a
call return between the client and the
server and so if there is a place where
we want to focus on saving overheads
it will be on avoiding copying multiple
times between the client and the server
in order to make the RPC calls efficient
and if you go back to this analogy of a
procedure call the nice thing about this
is that is the arguments are set up in
the stack and and that might involve
some data movement but there is not
kernel involvement in the data movement
and that's what we would like to be able
to accomplish in the RPC world as well
and in fact let's analyze how many times
copying happens in the RPC system recall
that in an RPC system the kernel has no
idea of the syntax and semantics of the
arguments that are passed between the
client and the server but yet the kernel
has to be the intermediary in arranging
the rendezvous between the client and
the server and therefore what happens in
the RPC system is that when a client
makes a call there is an entity that is
called a client stub and what the client
stub is going to do is the client is
thinking that is making a normal
procedure call but it is a remote
procedure call and the client stub knows
that and what it does is it takes the
arguments that is in the client call
which is living on the stack of the
client and makes an RPC packet out of it
this RPC packet is essentially
serializing the data structures that are
being passed as arguments by the client
into a sequence of bytes it's sort of
like herding cats into an enclosed space
so that's what is happening by the
client stub taking the arguments that
are on the stack of the client and
creating a packet of contiguous bytes
which is the RPC message because that is
the only
a the client can actually communicate
this information to the colonel so this
is the first copy that's happening from
the client stack into creating this RPC
message is the first copy that's
happening even before the colonel is
involved in this client-server
interchange the next thing that happens
the client raps into the colonel and the
colonel says well you know there is a
message which is the RPC message that
has to be communicated to the server and
that's sitting in the user address space
I better copy it into my kernel buffer
so that's the second copy that's
happening from the address space of the
client this RPC message is copied into
the kernel buffers so that's the second
copy next the kernel schedules the
server in the server domain because the
server has to execute this procedure so
once that server has been scheduled the
kernel copies the buffer it it has all
the arguments packaged in into the
server domain so that is the third copy
that's happening so this so we went from
the client stack to the RPC message
first copy from the RPC message to the
kernel buffer second copy and now the
kernel buffer is passed out to the
server domain that's a third copy but
unfortunately even though we've reached
the address space of the server the
server procedure cannot access this
because from the point of view of the
procedure called semantics the client
and the server think that they are just
doing a procedure call so the same
procedure is expecting all of the
arguments in the original form on the
stack of the server and that's where the
server stub comes in so what the server
stub is just like the client stub the
server stub is a piece of code
that is part of the RPC infrastructure
that understands the syntax and
semantics of the client-server
communication for this particular RPC
call and therefore it can take this
information that has now been passed
into the server's address space by the
kernel and structure it into the set of
actual parameters that the procedure the
server procedure is expecting
so this from the server domain wherever
the colonel put it into the stack of the
server for the Civil Procedure to
execute that procedure that's the fourth
copy so you can see that just going from
the client to the server there are four
copies involved these two copies are the
user level and these two copies are what
the kernel is doing in order to protect
itself and the address spaces from one
another by buffering the address based
contents into kernel buffer and passing
that to the server domain before the
server domain can start using it in the
form of actual parameters on the stack
so at this point the server can start
executing the server procedure can start
executing do its job when it is done it
has to do exactly the same thing
in order to pass the results back to the
client so it is going to go through four
copies except that you're going to
reverse it you're going to start from
the server stack and go all the way down
to getting the information to the client
stack in order for that exchange to
happen so in other words with a
client-server RPC call on the same
machine with a kernel involvement in
this process there's going to be four
copies each way going from the client to
the server there's four copies going
from the server back to the client
there's going to be four copies two
copies are happening in the user space
and two copies are happening in the
kernel space or orchestrated by by the
kernel and two copies orchestrated in
the user level now as you can see
there's a huge huge overhead compared to
a simple procedure call that I showed
you early on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
