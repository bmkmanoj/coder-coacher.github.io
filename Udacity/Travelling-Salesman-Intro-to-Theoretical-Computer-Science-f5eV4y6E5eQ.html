solving shortest tour well shortest tour
is the problem that has not been
investigated that much in the general
case for its closely related problems
traveling salesman we don't know but
there are many special cases of this
problem we're good approximations are
actually possible but the bounds of
approximation for shortest tour and
traveling salesmen have actually not
been investigated that much so if you're
really into it that would be a possible
area for research although it seems to
be quite hard to actually transfer the
results from here over to shortest tour
so maybe we can make Ellis a little bit
less happy although she has been quite
lucky in this course so she has a
constant factor approximation algorithm
there and the limit of 1.36 probably
doesn't affect her that much and Bob
well it's not really clear if you should
be happy or not but as we mentioned and
practice it's likely that his problem is
actually very well solvable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
