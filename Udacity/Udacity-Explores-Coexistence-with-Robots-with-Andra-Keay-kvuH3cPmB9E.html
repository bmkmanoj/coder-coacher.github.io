interactions that we have with them
right now right there's a lot of robots
that you've starting to see move into
factories right so there's there were
the factories that we had of the past
which we're basically just gigantic
robot arms and no humans were
interacting but now we're starting to
see you know other companies like
rethink robotics is a great example
right with their Baxter robot or their
kind of showing hey this robot you know
coexist and works along side a human in
a certain environment it seems like that
reaction is kind of mixed from a lot of
people right in these factories where
it's like it's great that this robots
helping me out but how long before this
robot kind of comes over and takes over
my job do you think that we're going to
get to a point where humans are going to
be replaced by robots and factories
altogether or do you think there's
always going to be some level of
existence of coexistence with a human
and a robot and a factory working
together I believe that robots are
always going to augment us rather than
replace us and I think at the moment the
best thing to do is to say that robots
take tasks not jobs but I would like to
see factories that don't have people in
them I think it's an inhuman job it is
the epitome of robotic labor you know I
don't believe that that is a job that
feeds human needs for social interaction
or creativity or any of the things that
we like I think if people didn't need
the money they wouldn't voluntarily go
to work in a factory and I think we have
an opportunity to look at our world our
life our economy our society and say we
have an opportunity to remake everything
what are the things that people
shouldn't be doing and they should not
be doing a lot of the dull dirty
dangerous jobs and it's one of the most
striking arguments for autonomous
vehicles is to reduce death on the roads
you know automobile accidents are one of
the greatest
costs four of human lives in in most
societies these days so that's
definitely a reason to look at having
autonomous vehicles which will have a
much better safety record as long as
we've got them to the point where
they've definitely going to have and I
think you need to be at a much greater
safety level than a human behind the
wheel because we accept a certain amount
of risk from human behavior we will not
accept that exact same amount of risk
from robot behavior robots have to be
significantly I think an order of
magnitude better before we're going to
want to wholesale that drop them into
certain areas but we shouldn't be mining
underground directly those that's one of
the most deadly jobs imaginable going
into space is also deadly I mean I
definitely want to go to Mars but I
don't want to spend unneeded amounts of
time in space preparing habitats and
building rockets and doing things that
have huge exposure to radiation so I
think there's a whole class of jobs that
we ought to automate completely as fast
as possible but every single robot
that's out there needs to be built it
needs to be programmed and it needs to
be managed and I think we're going to
have a huge class of employment that
relates to looking after and training
robots and it's going to range from the
highly skilled you know more algorithmic
jobs down to ones that are much more
physical like oh it's missed plugging
itself in down on aisle four let's go
and walk along and make sure that
they've all got a good context to charge
up and while we're at it let's you know
tidy that one up and we're slated to do
some routine maintenance you know let's
do these kind of things you know I see
robots and looking after robots will in
many ways take the place that the
automobile has had over the last century
so we've seen one transition where a
huge chunk of human society used to be
involved in looking after horses and
then they transition to looking after
automobiles and I think there's going to
be another transition to looking after
the broader range let's say I call a car
a robot it's just going to be many more
interview can go just be more
specialized in the sensitive so for
instance that gives you have a mechanic
now you might have somebody who works on
you know bio robots only or somebody who
works on air vehicles only you think
that's going to be kind of like the
emergence of new jobs it's like well
you're trained technically to do kind of
all of them but you're really going to
be focused on one area or one brand or
one manufacturer oh definitely you're
going to have really infinite scope for
specialization and ideally it won't be
manufacturer specific because I think
one of the things holding robotics back
is lack of some of the common standards
and platforms that you're going to need
to have so you know we see this in very
small scale with the importance of Ross
and with things like the importance of
the common standard for end effectors on
the end of robot arms so it doesn't
really matter whether it's a pentagram a
cougar or a universal robotics arm or a
soya from rethink robotics those range
of end effectors will all be able to be
used on it but where are some of the
other things that we're still developing
that multi robot communication protocols
and so forth yes maybe just using the
internet but what about in other
situations I think we're going to see
more common standards emerge we'll have
to but I think your specification will
relate to form factor and will relate to
industries so let's say a bipedal robot
that does something on farms is going to
be a vastly different bipedal robot to
one that is doing something in clothing
stores through so I also think that
there's a huge scope for creative
employment one of the jobs that you do
with social robotics is
right squid and you know look at Qatari
health is a great example of that half
their staff is basically writers and
psychologists yes and companies like
Anki and many of the others half of
their staff are game designers and
visual illustrators and I think also
people who are dance and theater people
because you're you're having to teach
and create the appropriate behaviors and
whatever the narrow area is then you
have to have domain expertise who
understand you know what is important in
a robot that has an interaction with you
for the purposes of understanding your
health needs and how different is that
to a robot that is going to interact
with you in a clothing store and it's
highly specialized but completely
different modes of behavior and
background knowledge required but we
underestimate the sheer physical I mean
robots it if anyone can remember the
very early days of the automobile and I
personally can't but they were all a
little different and they all didn't
work most of the time more or less
so just physically looking after them
sometimes the biggest thing we forget
when we talk about robots entering the
world is that they're going to be
physical and it might be like I said as
simple as putting it back on to charge
properly it might be losing something
out of the way because it stopped
working and maybe there is something
blocking it so you can't teleoperated
out of the way there's going to be a
heap of teleoperation and one of the big
ways in which I think we need to
interact with where robots and humans
will work together has to do with that
remote operation so I see a future where
the robot can tell you where to find
things on aisle 4 and offer to show you
the way but when you ask it if they
think that this brand is better than
that brand that immediately goes to the
human operator right because why
new to shampoo or something Oh or
necessarily have the ability to ask the
right questions to understand who is it
for
what is the this or the perhaps just the
trust level that we that we would have
from an interaction with a person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
