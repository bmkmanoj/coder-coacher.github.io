here but notice that it's labeled as Y
and that could get confusing since I
already had a y up here which stood for
my original function why was the output
of this function so in order to not
confuse these two let's label this F
inverse of X so instead of having y
equals the quantity X minus 3/2 we'll
have f inverse of x equals x minus 3/2
now notice that this is actually a line
to if we divide two into each term will
have F inverse of X equals one-half X
minus three halves negative three halves
or negative one and a half is our
y-intercept and our slope here would be
positive one-half and I just want to
caution you to be careful with this
negative one this isn't an exponent like
we normally think about it this is just
the notation for the inverse of a
function so if we take some input X and
we multiply it by two and add three to
undo these operations we would have to
subtract three first and then divide by
two now that should make sense since
we're just undoing the last operation we
did to X and working backwards so we
need to undo the ad by three which is
minus three and then we undo the
multiplication of two which is divided
by two let's look closely at the graph
of this function and it's inverse to see
one more unique relationship it's
actually one we've already encountered
here on this blue graft I've graph the
line y equals 2x plus 3 we have a
y-intercept at three and a slope of up
two units right one unit to get our next
point of 1 comma five now our inverse
function was one-half X minus three
halves or we could have written the
equation like this X minus 3 all divided
by two it's the same exact line notice
that for this line our y-intercept is at
negative 3 halves and the slope is
positive 1 right 2 positive one
right too so again this was our original
function and then this one was the
inverse now what I want to show you is
this line y equals x here's the black
line drawn in notice that the function
and it's inverse are reflected over the
line y equals x in other words if we
fold this part over the black line we
would get this inverse function of our
graph and if we fold this part of the
original function over our black line we
get this part of the inverse function if
we look more closely at a point like 0 3
which is on our original function we can
find a corresponding point on the
inverse function this one's 30 notice
the X and the y coordinates have changed
they switch places this is what's so
unique about inverse functions the x and
y coordinates always change so if we
choose another point on the graph like
negative 1 point 5 comma 0 for our
function we can find it on our inverse
function that would be 0 comma negative
1.5 and again the X and the y coordinate
switch places even for a point like
negative 4 comma negative 5 we can find
that on our inverse on the inverse
function it will be negative 5 comma
negative for that point is right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
