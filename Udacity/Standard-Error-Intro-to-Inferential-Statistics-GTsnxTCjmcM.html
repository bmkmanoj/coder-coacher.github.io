because it's based on two sample sizes
and two standard deviations what is this
new standard error in problem set ten
number ten you saw that if we subtract
normally distributed data from other
normally distributed data we get a new
data set so here I'm symbolizing
normally distributed data with the mean
of mu sub 1 and a standard deviation of
Sigma sub 1 and we're subtracting
normally distributed data with mean mu
sub 2 sigma sub 2 we get a new data set
that has mean of just the difference
between these two means and then the
standard deviation is the sum of the
variances and then the square root for
samples it's roughly the same the
standard deviation of this new data set
is even bigger than that for each
individual data set so we know that this
standard deviation of the combined data
sets is greater than the standard
deviation of just one of the samples
because if we square both sides we get
this and we know that this is true
because these are the same and so
therefore if we add the variance of the
second sample on this side then this
side will be bigger than just this
similarly the standard deviation of the
combined data sets is bigger than that
for the second sample you can think
about it intuitively because if we have
two different distributions and then we
subtract this data from the other
there's going to be even more error than
what exists in each individual
distribution like we might subtract this
data value out here from this one here
or we could subtract a data value down
here from a data value here and then
when we combine them we have a much
wider distribution and this is the
standard deviation now again with
independent samples we're analyzing the
difference between those means remember
how before with the one-sample t-test
our standard error was s divided by root
n well now we're using this for us
because it's based on two samples
instead of one so we can replace this s
with our new one then we can rewrite
this since both the numerator and
denominator are under the radical sign
we can say it's the same as this and
finally we can rewrite it like this now
what happens if our two sample sizes are
different then we simply have sample
size 14 the first sample and the sample
size 24 the second sample this is our
new standard error for independent
samples before with paired data or
dependent samples we could simply
calculate the difference between each
value for each subject and then we could
calculate the standard deviation
therefore before we just had that one s
but now we have two different samples
and they can each be different sizes
this also changes our degrees of freedom
but it's easy to understand before we
just subtracted one from the sample size
well now we subtract one from each
sample size and then add them subtract
one from n1 subtract one from n to add
them and that's the same as adding the
sample sizes and then subtracting two
and here's the degrees of freedom will
use for the rest of this lesson a more
conservative approach when we're not
using software is to use the smaller of
n1 minus 1 and n 2 minus 1 in other
words the smaller of the two degrees of
freedom from the two samples but for now
we'll just use n 1 plus n 2 minus 2
because that's what you'll use later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
