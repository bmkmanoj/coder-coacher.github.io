model has classes in it and those
classes are likely to show up in the
design model however some additional
classes may also need to be there what's
going on is the following object
oriented development methods have an
advantage called traceability what this
means is that you can see starting with
the real world that's being modeled
classes that directly represent those
real world objects those classes show up
in the object-oriented design as well
and in the ultimate code that is you can
trace a line in either direction between
the real world problem and the code
constructs this can be a real benefit in
dealing with maintenance of the system
however along the way you may have to
invent some other classes and that's
what we want to examine first and
foremost you may need to implement
relationships your programming language
doesn't have associations in it it's
going to be up to you to come up with a
way for each of the associations in the
analysis model how you going to deal
with it at design time and in your
program you're also going to have to
deal with intermediate results for
example if you have some complex
computation that's going to be used in
several places you want to store it in
some intermediate intermediate variable
and then reuse it in the two places so
you don't have to recompute it
constructing those intermediate results
may mean you're inventing new classes
and third you may want to invent new
classes for abstraction purposes object
oriented languages provide you the
ability to have abstract classes which
capture common features of lower level
classes and inventing those abstract
classes and including them into your
design can improve long-term
maintainability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
