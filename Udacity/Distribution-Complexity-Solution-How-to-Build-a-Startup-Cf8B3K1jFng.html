distribution channels available to a
startup and we talked about picking one
but what's really interesting is the
solution complexity that each channel
can handle that is system integrators
are designed to handle complex systems
and so therefore on the x-axis we see
increasing complexity of what each
channel can actually handle and what's
the sales and marketing complexity of
each sale on the y-axis so for example
system integrators are great for putting
in defense systems or telecom systems
that require hundreds or thousands of
moving parts and software and hardware
we're on the other extreme the
complexity of selling toner over the web
incredibly simple simply consumers
already know what they want and the
channel just simply is there to fulfill
and user demand and the marketing
complexity you simply just say toner for
your printer so when we look at a sales
channel we talk about what's called
value-added how much of value is the
channel adding and as we go up this
curve we're seeing higher value-added at
each step web tell us a lead retail
maybe adds a little support VARs a lot
of integration and support direct sales
that's direct connection to your factory
system integrators not only supporting
and service and integrating your
products but potentially tens of others
so each portion of this channel is
adding higher and higher value now
what's interesting is this higher
value-added comes with a cost typically
higher volume systems are at the low end
so you might be selling hundreds or
hundreds of thousands of cases of toners
but you might be doing ten large system
integrations a year some more examples
retail channel might carry pcs VARs
might do video editing systems
at our turn key for direct sales though
this is the anomaly remember these are
the sales people work for you directly
when the interesting things that you'll
be considering later is how much you're
paying your salespeople and how many
dollars they need to be bringing in
every year to justify their existence
and bringing a profit to their company
so this too ends up to be an interesting
calculation your direct sales people can
actually be the one talking to the
consumers directly or they could be the
ones selling to system integrators VARs
retail and web and telesales people and
so this is a math problem we'll think
about in the coming discussions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
