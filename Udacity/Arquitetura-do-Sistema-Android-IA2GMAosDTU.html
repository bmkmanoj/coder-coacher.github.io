about the android system architecture
the android framework offers lots of
useful classes to help you interact with
the system thank the activity of life
cycle or device permissions for example
or to help you access some type of
device functionality like the camera or
the radios like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
sometimes sensors like the gyroscope the
path to accessing device hardware from
the framework comes together via a
series of layered abstractions what do I
mean by that each layer focus on solving
a bit of the problem while the
underlying layers focus on solving
subsequently smaller problems until
eventually with all the layers combined
the desired functionality is achieved
now we won't go into heavy details about
what each layer does but we'll help you
focus on the layers that you should be
familiar with let's take a look you can
think of a functioning Android device as
being made up of different layers now
we've simplified this a tad to focus on
the essentials but feel free to check
out the link in the notes for an
exhaustive diagram on the android open
source project site the very top layer
is the application layer where all the
applications that developers like you
and I build within our app we make use
of the android framework classes like
textview and activity and when we use
these classes we can do some complex or
powerful things with only a few lines of
code in this case we're displaying some
text or opening a new screen for example
but there's so much more so how's this
possible well these framework classes
are abstract away unnecessary complexity
from us by calling into the lower levels
of Android and relying on them to do the
heavy lifting that is the tough and
intricate job of controlling a device's
hardware until eventually it all works
and this is what we mean by layered
abstractions the core operating system
or OS for short has its own
sophisticated code to regulate how
application and system processes both
access the limited resources of the
device hardware now application is
running simultaneously must share the
resources of the device in order to
preserve the system's overall usability
and responsiveness the lowest layer is
the actual physical device hardware that
is the silicon that makes up
for example the wireless radios like
cellular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth the chips
that control the screen and then there's
the CPU the memory the GPU and much much
more these are the physical electronic
components that are packed into your
device if you were to take away one
thing know that the beauty of these
layers is that they exist to simplify or
abstract away the system's complexity
from you as a developer allowing you to
focus on making great apps that can
leverage as much of devices hardware as
possible so you can think of the
framework as this glue between our app
and the device the framework classes
allow us to articulate how the device
should behave when a user is in our app
now the framework is composed of all
these Java classes that we see on
developer android com as well as some
libraries written in a programming
language called C and its relatives
let's talk about a few examples of how
we've already relied on these different
layers without even realizing it in our
app code we've been calling the
framework api's so for example when we
were building the Miwok app we were
using the media framework classes to
play audio from the speaker's of the
device in the current lesson we're using
the HTTP URL connection class to make
Network requests which uses the radio on
the device to send packets of
information across the Internet now we
don't need to deal with the Android
operating system directly now the
framework classes are Java classes that
abstract the implementation details of
what's happening underneath in the
hardware now the media player and HTTP
URL connection are two examples of
classes that use the physical
functionality of our Android device by
interacting with framework classes there
are many more examples that you'll come
across as you continue to learn more
