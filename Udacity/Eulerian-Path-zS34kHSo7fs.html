types of paths in graphs here a path is
just a specific route you take in a
traversal or search for example you
could create a path that travels through
every edge in a graph at least once that
path is called an or Larian path yes
it's pronounced oil Arian after the
famous mathematician Euler in a basic a
lariat path you start at one node
traverse through all edges and might end
up at a different node in an oily Rhian
cycle you must Traverse every edge only
once and end up at the same node that
you started with it turns out that not
every graph is capable of having an oil
arian path in this graph no matter where
you start you'll get stuck on one of
these outer nodes and won't be able to
reach the other nodes without traveling
over an edge you've already seen there's
a nice trick here our good friend Euler
said that graphs can only have oil arian
cycles if all vertices have an even
degree or an even number of edges
connected to them oil aryan paths are a
little bit more lenient so it's ok for a
graph to have two nodes with an odd
degree as long as they're the start and
end of the path let's look at a quick
algorithm for finding oil aryan cycles
you can start at any vertex and follow
edges until you return back to that
vertex if you didn't encounter every
edge you can start from an unseen edge
connected to a node you've already
visited again you create a path through
those unseen edges you can continue this
process until you've seen every edge in
the graph once then you can simply add
the paths together combining them at the
nodes they have in common this algorithm
is really efficient it takes Big O of
the number of edges since it visits
every edge once which is the best we
could hope for a Hamiltonian path is
another type of path that must go
through every vertex once similarly a
Hamiltonian cycle will start an end with
the same vertex trying to decide whether
a graph has a Hamiltonian path is a
famous issue in computer science called
the Hamiltonian path problem we don't
quite have the tools to talk about it
yet but we'll talk about similarly
famous problems very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
