class is all about managing complexity
now many types of software manage
complexity by trying to artificially
rule out any type of uncertainty that is
say you have a checkbook balancing
program and it says you got to enter the
exact amount you got to say thirty nine
dollars and twenty-seven cents you can't
say oh I don't know about forty dollars
it's easier to write programs that deal
that way but it constrains what you can
do so in this unit we're going to learn
about how the laws of probability can
allow you to deal with uncertainty in
your programs and now the truly amazing
thing is that you can allow uncertainty
in what you know about the world what's
true right now and uncertainty in your
actions if the program does something
what's going to happen next even though
both of those are uncertain you can
still use the laws of probability to
calculate what it means to do the right
thing that is we can have clarity of
action we can know exactly what the best
thing to do is even though we're
uncertain about what's going to happen
so follow with this unit and we'll learn
how to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
