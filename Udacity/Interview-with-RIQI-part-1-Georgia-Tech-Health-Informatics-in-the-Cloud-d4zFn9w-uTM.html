Rhode Island quality Institute which
operates the state of Rhode Island's
health information exchange called
current care Laura I really appreciate
your taking the time to be with us today
the current care has a very interesting
history dating all the way back to 2001
and if you could just explain that to us
that maybe the role you played in
getting surescripts launched briefly and
walk us through today that would be
great certainly we started in 2001 as a
public-private partnership where a 501
not-for-profit freestanding entity not a
state agency but deeply engaged with our
state as a partner in all of this our
goal was to dramatically improve quality
safety and value we started out as a
consortium of leaders basically people
with their hands on the levers of Rhode
Island's health care system and our
first question was well great we're all
in a room we're all agreeing to
collaborate what do we do we settled on
information technology my background is
quality improvement and I knew that I
was stymied at every turn because of the
paper-based system that if we were
really going to improve quality we had
to go for health information technology
so we became the place where surescripts
decided that they would do their first
beta test of an to end true electronic
prescribing that pilot ended up being an
incredible success and obviously
surescripts as a nationwide now in
robust and we're very proud of that
opportunity to participate in that from
that point on we received the state on
our behalf the state government received
a grant from the agency for Healthcare
Research and quality called the state
and regional demonstrations and health
information exchange that came in 2004
and kicked off the funding for our
privacy framework our governance
framework and our stakeholder engagement
piece of this Along Came hi-tech in 2009
our organization was the only one to hit
the trifecta to win all three major
hi-tech grants that was the beacon the
hie in the Regional Extension Center we
were able to land about 27 million
dollars and ninety days to build out
everything that we've done so far so
that's sort of the history of how it all
came about now one of the reasons I'm
here is because you're such a
innovative and extensive user of direct
so how did that come about we are big
believer in a centralized model in that
we want and I think what model you
choose depends on what you're looking to
do in the future what your goals are for
ours we wanted a very robust persistent
database where we could do research we
could do quality improvement population
health comparative public reporting lots
of things with that but we SAT there
looking at the in 2004 we did a little
survey they were 60 plus different EHR
platforms in our state and we said what
are we going to integrate with all 60 of
these and there's going to be 70 there's
going to be 80 and then we have to keep
every interface up and running the cost
of that was beyond our reach and the
time frame for doing that was beyond our
comprehension we want to move fast here
so suddenly we were at a national
meeting when direct was announced and
then our chief operating officer Gary
Christenson turned to me and said point
to point he said what if one of those
points is an EHR and the other point is
our hie current care couldn't we use
that to lift a continuity of care
document out of those EHRs no interface
required no upkeep required no millions
of dollars to get our community
connected we were astonished at the
simplicity of that solution and it has
worked for us so we have platforms in
bed a line of code when a physician
closes a record or there's some other
trigger that they've put into their
platform we close the record it sends
out an automatic API call up to it
direct message is formed it attaches the
current continuity of care document
ships it up to current care so it's all
automated behind the scenes no physician
ever has to push a button to remember to
do something it's automated so for us
direct was we were incredibly excited
about it so I want the students to focus
on what Lord just said I've talked
repeatedly about the need to integrate
direct into workflow and you just heard
an example of that that's right that's
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
