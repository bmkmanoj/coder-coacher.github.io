president and chief operating officer
here at Udacity I have one big job and
that's to help our folks help our
students I think what students always
have to remember is they have to be the
best salesperson possible for their idea
and what that means is being able to
crisply articulate exactly what their
idea is in a few short sentences it's
important not to get too lost in the
details it's important to really
understand what your idea is about and
be able to tell anyone who wants to know
exactly what your idea is all about like
anything else that's important practice
is really important try it out try it
out on your friends throughout your
parents trying it out on your colleagues
turn on anyone that will listen in fact
don't be worried about sounding foolish
keep continue to work on that really
crisp pitch of what your idea is all
about with any and all who will listen
to it don't worry about giving that idea
away or any secrecy the better you get
at talking about your idea in a way that
excites and engages people the better
opportunity you have to build that great
thing that you want to build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
