my approach is going to be to use a tree
or another way to think of this is to
use recursion let's say that we start
out with our possible guests remaining
to be LM ecs and SBA and the people
who've showed up let's say right now
that's zero and I'm going to walk
through and diagram a tree that shows
all eight possibilities let's say I
start out with three guests to invite
and i'm going to pick the first one
right now one possibility is that LM
shows up another possibility is that LM
does not so now i have to other worlds
to consider in this first one LM has
showed up and i still have to invite ecs
in sba and see what happens over here no
one has showed up but i still have to
invite ecs and sba let's work here on
the left first now it's time to invite
ecs one possibility is that she shows up
another possibility is that she does not
but since LM showed up earlier she's
still here in any event I still have to
invite or consider SBA let's say I do
invite SBA one possibility is that she
shows up another possibility is that she
does not and now I'm out of people to
consider inviting so we're done over
here on the left back over here in this
possible world only LM has shown up so
far let's go invite SBA one possibility
is that SBA shows up another possibility
is that she does not and you can see how
this pattern would repeat in the other
side of the tree I'll just do it here
quickly and now at the bottom of the
tree you can see all 8 of our answers 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ranging from everyone
shows up to no one shows up in this tree
every time we go down a level every time
we consider another guest we have two
branches so the size of the tree doubles
each time which is just what we reasoned
about before in this particular running
example my three friends that I invited
for dinner LM ecs and SBA were lucretia
mott Elizabeth Cady Stanton and susan b
anthony three american abolitionists
that is they oppose slavery who then
went on a champion women's right to vote
all right so how am I going to implement
this I'm going to make a recursive
procedure that has two arguments one
corresponding to the remaining people to
invite and another core
responding to who has showed up so far
unlike many other recursive procedures
i'm going to call myself recursively
twice once in the case where the current
person accepts once in the case where
they don't alright so here we are in the
interpreter the integrated development
environment we're going to write a
procedure that accepts a list as an
argument and then prints out all the
subsets of that list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
