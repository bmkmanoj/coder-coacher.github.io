background knowledge which said that
brick is a kind of block and red is a
kind of block as well in that case the
air programmer uses background knowledge
to further revises current concept
definition and replaces brick or wedge
by a block because both bricks and
wedges are examples of blocks so we'll
call this a crime tree hero stick here
is the tree of background knowledge with
climbing de tree node another
interesting aspect of this suppose that
there was another client of Brock that
was possible see a cylinder so now that
the air program is generalized from
brick and wedge into a block and this is
the current definition if a new example
comes along and it has a cylinder at the
top here that would be covered by this
particular concept and this AI program
would be able to recognize that
particular instance which are the
cylinders are top as an example of this
concept definition that is the power of
being able to use this background
knowledge to generalize the more we know
the more we can learn so it sounds like
this is actually an example of what I
was doing earlier I had said that
because I saw a brick and a cylinder
both playing the same role that there
were both examples of block and
therefore any block could play that role
then when I saw that funny kind of
little arch shape holding up the block
on top i inferred that that would also
be an acceptable answer because both
brick and cylinders were blocks and I
generalized out to say any block could
play that role good connection David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
