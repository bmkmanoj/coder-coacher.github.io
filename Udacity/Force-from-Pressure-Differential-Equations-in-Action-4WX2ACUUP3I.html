velocity but also we have pressure
velocity has a direction pressure
doesn't now let's try to find out how to
incorporate pressure in our equations to
make things simple we look at a
one-dimensional situation a straight
pipe filled with fluid capital a is the
cross section area of that pipe let's
replace some amount of that fluid with a
piston of width Delta X and let's assume
that the pressure to the left of that
piston is p1 and the pressure to the
right of that piston is p2 then this
force is proportional to the difference
of those two pressures and if p1 the
pressure on the left is larger than p2
the pressure on the right the force is
to the right so we have to choose signs
like that and the proportionality
constant is simply the area if you
double the area you double the force if
we say that this piston has a volume of
V then the area of course is the volume
of the piston divided by its width so we
want to use this as part of our
differential equations what should we be
writing what's the force per volume the
partial derivative of pressure with
respect to X minus the partial
derivative of the pressure with respect
to X half the partial derivative or the
pressure divided by the square root of
the area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
