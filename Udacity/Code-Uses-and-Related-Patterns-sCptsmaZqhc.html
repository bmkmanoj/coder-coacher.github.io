sections one is sample code and this
actually may be the largest section in
which in a variety of languages
including C++ and small talk examples of
coded uses of the pattern are included
as a side note this particular book was
written before Java became popular so
there are no Java examples however there
are other books which include Java
solutions to the similar pattern
problems next section is known uses as i
said the authors of gof were master
designers and they had themselves
written or were familiar with many
important object oriented systems and
they indicate which systems use which
patterns in this section of of each
pattern description and finally the
final section is related patterns that
is how the given pattern relates to
other patterns turns out that elegantly
written applications often use multiple
cooperating patterns this is sometimes
called pattern density this section of
the book lists other patterns which
might be used together with this pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
