assumes that the samples are
approximately the same size we must
correct for the sample size first by
pooling the variances so now we're going
to slightly change the standard error
that we've been using the pooled
variance which will denote S sub P
squared because remember that s squared
was the variance and s was the standard
deviation is the average of the two
sample variances that corrects for
different sample sizes remember when we
had one sample that the variance was the
sum of squares divided by the degrees of
freedom which written out is the sum of
the squared deviations divided by n
minus 1 with pooled variances we're
doing almost the same thing when we have
two samples we'll add the sum of squares
for each and then divide by the sum of
the degrees of freedom let's go through
an example let's say we have two samples
which we'll call X and y we want to know
if the populations that these samples
are from are significantly different
first find the sum of squares for each
remember that to do this you'll have to
find each deviation from the mean and
then square them and then add them up
you're welcome to write each deviation
and squared deviation in these columns
but you don't have to we just provide
the boxes there so that that can help
you as you calculate the sum of squares
but you can always use technology Excel
or R whatever you want to use or you can
just do it by hand rather than typing
them in whatever is easiest as long as
you get these sum of squares</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
