players don't don't drink be players or
am i a minus players and that's that's a
no-brainer everybody wants to eclipse
the hard thing is to get them especially
when you're small so let's say that you
have a new new company you don't have
any money at all or you know what even
worse you have half a million 1 million
in funding is supposed to be able to
offer something to you in place but but
you know that you can't because you have
a run rate or that is very limited so
you can offer all kinds of things first
of all you can offer stock options
that's again that's obvious you can
offer your first employees options that
hopefully will get them which very soon
another thing that you can offer them
besides salary is specifics and so
another thing that you can offer them
its benefits some benefits will go a
long way like health plans and
subscriptions to genes it depends where
you live filling in San Francisco that's
nothing but if you live Midwest that's
something else like it's more popular
the most important thing that a new
company can offer the employees is a
sense of purpose and culture because if
you have a good culture you have
something special you have if that good
vibe going on in your office it's worth
more than money to some people people
would like to go to work for you because
you give them an experience that you
give them the option to walk with
amazing people for a great company they
feel that they really contribute and
this is something that goes a long way
another thing that you can offer your
new employees is to give them the option
to work with people they seem as
important is smarter than them more
experienced people they can actually
learn something from people that will
help them get more advance in their
career they can learn form they can
build something special with those
people and this is something that you
can't buy it with money like it's wolf
more than an extra ten or twenty
thousand dollars a year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
