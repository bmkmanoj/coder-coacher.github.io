we have an equation that actually has
numbers in it however it's time for me
to make a confession I'm really really
lazy I'm just super tired of writing out
all these words in our equation I know
that it's important for us to keep in
mind what our equation is about but I
think that we can remember that even if
we do take a few shortcuts as long as I
remember what belongs in this spot of
the equation or what this part of the
equation means I might as well rewrite
money grant has left with something
shorter I've kind of already taken a few
shortcuts actually for example I've used
a dollar sign instead of writing out the
word money and I used a pound cyant
instead of writing out the words number
of so it's okay to take shortcuts as
long as they make sense to us so the
thing that I decided to replace these
words with could be really whatever we
want a single letter or a single symbol
I think I'm going to use a square we can
do a similar thing for a number of
months over here going with the geometry
theme I'm going to call this triangle
instead of number of months so what I'm
really doing here then is assigning a
new name to each of these parts of the
equation we're going to say that square
equals money grant has left in triangle
equals number of months so let's rewrite
this top equation up here using our new
symbols here are four slots that we need
to fill in to make our new equation or
rather our modified version of the
original equation please pick from the
buttons under each slot to select which
number a symbol belongs in the box above
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
