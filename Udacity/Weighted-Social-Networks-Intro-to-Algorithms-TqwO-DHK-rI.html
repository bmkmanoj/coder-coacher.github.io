about with the Marvel comic book
characters the strength of the link
between some character I and some
character J was the number of comic
books they appeared in together now this
isn't actually a very useful metric for
real life social networks I have not
appeared in any comic books with anyone
I have one friend who actually has
appeared in a comic book researcher by
the name of Michael bowling at the
University of Alberta actually had a
comic book character made about himself
which is pretty awesome but I didn't
appear in that comic book with him so
it's that's not a very good metric you
know we wouldn't really need to be
studying weighted social networks just
for comic book characters but there's
lots of other natural measures of the
strength of a connection between a
person I and a person Jay you could
imagine saying they're more strongly
connected as a function of how often
they email each other or maybe how many
years they've known each other the
frequency with which they meet in a in a
given week how often they rate each
other's posts on some kind of social
networking site maybe the number of news
articles both have read and you can
imagine lots more examples like these so
this notion of having a weight in a
social network is actually a pretty
important and relevant concept so we had
talked about shortest paths in a graph
but now let's extend this notion to the
shortest weighted paths in a graph so
here in this example now we're going to
look at a high weight meaning a weak
connection and a low weight meaning a
strong connection so you can think of
the weights almost as being a kind of
cost and we're looking for basically
cheap routes from one person in the
network to another so an example of this
sort of thing might be that we want to
send a message from one person to
another in a social network minimizing
say social awkwardness for example my
son is really interested in American
history and my Dean is an expert in
American history and he wanted to ask
the Dean a question but that's kind of
awkward they actually don't know each
other directly they accept that they do
know each other directly at sea random
young men don't generally contact deems
of big art schools of arts and sciences
there's sort of high social awkwardness
for that but I was able to help get a
message from my son to the Dean because
I have very low social awkwardness with
my son and I have fairly low social
awkwardness with the Dean so the path of
sending a message basically
recommendation for a book to read about
American history traveled much more
easily through me to the Dean than it
would have to the Dean directly oh and I
should note that
my son also has curly hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
