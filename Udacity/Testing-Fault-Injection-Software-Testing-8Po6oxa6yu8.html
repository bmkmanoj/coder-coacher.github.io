time so we can see is that the read is
that our fault injection version of read
is indeed reading less bites than the
full number of bites we asked for and
what you can see is the first time it's
called it gets a range from one to three
one to one so it's gonna pick something
in the middle usually but then
successive read calls have a narrower
narrow range of random numbers they can
return and so that's what that's what
explains this kind of progression of
numbers that's what explains this sort
of progression of numbers towards
smaller numbers and so there should be a
hundred of these little sequences due to
our hundred do the fact that we let the
test loop 100 times
so the question we can ask is is our
confidence in the software now all
higher well probably there are other
tests we should do like one thing we
could do is use a read fault injection
function instead of being random just
reads one byte every time that might end
up being a reasonable stress test
another thing we might do is simulate
random and the file conditions and
random errors that read is allowed to
return so during our testing the read
system call never actually returned an
error value it always read the file
successfully but if we want to use false
injection to make it do that then we
have to have we have to modify our
program a little bit and I'm not going
to do that right now but in the meantime
I think we've established that the logic
here is fairly solid I can deal with a
wide variety of conditions and one thing
we might want to do just before leaving
is run at a million times instead of a
hundred times okay so we compile this
with optimizations and we run it it's
running a million iterations of the test
sequence so it's doing a million
iterations of this little of this little
sequence here and let's see how long
this takes hopefully it's not very long
okay there we go it took like 15 or 20
seconds so that was a little bit painful
but not that bad overall so the question
is now do we have reasonable confidence
that our logic is solid and except for
the error handling condition that I
already talked about I would say that
this is probably pretty solid this is
probably pretty solid code now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
