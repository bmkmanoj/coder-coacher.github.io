good oh I mean it's really good but all
it is is a simple javascript file that
sits between you and network requests
it's a type of web worker meaning it
runs separately from your page it isn't
visible to the user it can't access the
Dom but it does control pages and by
control I mean intercepts requests as
the browser makes them from there you
can do well whatever you want really you
can send the request off to the network
as per usual or you can skip the network
go to some kind of cache or create a
custom random response or any
combination of those things you register
for a serviceworker like this giving the
location of your serviceworker script it
returns a promise so you get callbacks
for success and failure if you're
unfamiliar with promises don't worry
we'll guide you through the bits you
need to know throughout the course if
you call register when the service
workers already registered that's fine
the browser won't be registered it'll
just return a promise for the existing
registration you can also provide a
scope the serviceworker will control any
page whose URL begins with the scope and
it will ignore any that don't so for
this example the serviceworker will
control a page at this URL and also
anything with a deeper URL but not
anything with a shallower URL the
serviceworker doesn't get to control
this one nor will it control an
unrelated URL but be aware that this
serviceworker won't control this URL as
it doesn't have the trailing slash so it
counts as a shallower URL you can have
multiple service workers with different
scopes which is really handy for
something like github pages where
multiple projects share the same origin
scopes let you have a different
serviceworker for each project
the default scope is determined by the
location of the serviceworker script
it's basically the path the script sits
in usually you don't need to set the
scope just put the serviceworker script
in the right place
but what happens within the
serviceworker while you listen for
particular events just like other
JavaScript events you can react to them
or even prevent the default and do your
own thing we'll introduce these events
one by one as the course progresses but
what about browser support this site is
serviceworker ready
a breakdown of support by features and a
link to that in the presenter notes
every browser has expressed some
interest in implementing but as of 2015
serviceworker is only supported in
Chrome and opera with Firefox support
soon to land but just because a
technology isn't universally supported
doesn't mean you should wait the
serviceworker is entirely progressive
enhancement friendly meaning we can use
it in browsers that support it without
disrupting users of older browsers they
just won't get the benefits in fact
using this stuff today to improve the
user experience will encourage other
browsers to implement it so their users
get the benefit to to use serviceworker
in a safe progressive enhancing way just
make sure you wrap code in a simple
feature detect if a browser doesn't
support service workers navigator dot
serviceworker will be undefined which is
a faulty value so all the browser's will
skip everything within the if statement
and avoid trying to call functions that
aren't defined right that's most of the
nitty-gritty details covered so let's
all hold hands chant and summon our
resident quiz master Mike Wales Mike can
you hear me from beyond the Atlantic I
certainly can it's time to get quizzical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
