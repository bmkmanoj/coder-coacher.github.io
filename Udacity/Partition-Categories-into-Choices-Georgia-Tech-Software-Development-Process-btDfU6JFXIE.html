involves partitioning the categories
that we just identified in two choices
and this choices are the interesting
cases for each category so the
interesting subdomains for each one of
these categories so once more let's look
at that using our example the split
program so let's start by considering
lengths what are the interesting cases
when we think about the length of the
string some of those we already saw one
interesting case is the case of the
length of size 0 so a string with no
characters another interesting case is
the one in which the length of the
string is size minus 1 so the string is
just one character short of the size at
which you will be cut by the split
program and we can continue along this
line so we will select the size size
plus one size so twice the value of size
minus one and so on and so forth but
even without listing all of those I'm
sure you get the idea of what it means
to identify this interesting cases let's
instead move and start considering the
content so what are the interesting
cases when we think about the content of
the string it's a possible interesting
case is a string that contains only
spaces why well maybe because this plate
is treating spaces in a special way
similarly a string that contains special
characters like non-printable characters
like tabulation characters new line may
also be an interesting case something
that we want to test also in this case
we could continue and go on and on so
basically here you just want to put all
the interesting cases that you can think
of when you consider the content of a
string now let's move to the value as
the next category so the value of the
input size and here we might want to
consider a size 0 special case a normal
situation like size greater than 0
another special case a size less than 0
or max int and these are if you remember
are exactly the cases that we consider
when we looked at this example before
and also here we can continue and go on
and on so at the end of the step what we
have is a set of interesting cases for
each one of the categories and now we
can start to think about how we want to
combine them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
