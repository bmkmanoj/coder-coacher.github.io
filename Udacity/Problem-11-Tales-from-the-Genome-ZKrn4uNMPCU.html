tougher because the mutation in the
enhancer makes it more similar to the
consensus but the overall amount of
activator in the cell decreases now
based on the simple constraints we've
set up for this word problem and based
on what we learned in this lesson the
right answer here is that we wouldn't
expect to see any major change in
transcription we made the enhancer more
efficient right because it's more closer
to the consensus sequence but we removed
some of the protein that's around to
bind and be more efficient so with less
protein around now we've just
essentially balanced out the enhancer
mutation now in reality it's a bit more
complicated in this it depends on well
how effective was that mutation was it a
lot more similar or is it only a little
bit more similar was it a critical
position was it a less critical position
and how much of this activator do we
remove a little bit a lot so yes in
reality it's more complicated you'd have
to measure it but for our constraints
here for the simple situation we
increase the efficiency of the enhancer
but decrease the amount of protein
forward to interact with so we wouldn't
expect to see a major change in
transcription</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
