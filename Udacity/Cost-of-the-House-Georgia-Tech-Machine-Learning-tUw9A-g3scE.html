together to deal with this minor trifle
of a problem that you've observed with
my cool new algorithm okay
so here's some data it's a graph you see
here's a y-axis and here's an x-axis and
each of these points represents a house
on this map which I'm cleverly using in
the background and you'll notice that
each of the dots is colored I'm gonna
say that red represents really expensive
houses blue represents moderately
expensive houses and green represents
really inexpensive houses okay
okay is this where is this oh this is a
this is a Georgia Tech as you can tell
because it says Georgia Tech how I see
it now okay
so here's what I want you to do using a
machine learning I want you to look at
all of this data and then I want you to
tell me for these little black dots
whether they are really expensive
moderately expensive or or inexpensive
but I want you to do it using something
like the technique that we talked about
before
okay so let's look at this little dot
over here which by the way I want to
point out this little black dot here by
the US Post Office underneath the
rightmost e over here is not a point in
our database but I think by staring at
this you might be able to come up with a
reasonable guess about whether it is
moderately expensive expensive or
inexpensive okay yeah I think this is a
helpful example because now I see that
it does kind of make sense especially in
this context to think about the
geometric location as actually being a
really useful attribute for deciding how
to label the new points so that black
point that you pointed out is in the
part of a neighborhood that has a green
dot in it like the nearest dot to it
seems like a pretty good guess as to
what what the value of that house might
be so I'm gonna guess green yes and I
think you would be right and I like the
word that you use there you talked about
its nearest neighbor so I like that I'm
gonna write that down neighbor okay so
I'm gonna look at my nearest neighbor
well let's see if this works
for another point let's look at another
point that's near an e let's see the
first I over here this little black
point over here what do you think if I
if I looked at my nearest neighbor what
would I what would I
yeah this one seems really clear it's
it's surrounded by red it's in the red
part of town so you're guessing the
output is then purple no I'm going with
red yes and I think that that makes
perfect sense so this is pretty cool I
have a point that's not in my database
but I still by looking at my nearest
neighbor can sort of figure out what the
actual value should be so there we have
solved the problem yeah it seems like a
pretty good rule yeah just look at your
nearest neighbor and you're done there
so boom there's nothing else for you to
do yeah except that you didn't do all
the houses yet okay what did I miss
the one in the middle mm-hmm and I'm
wondering if maybe you did that on
purpose because this one has some issues
whatever its issues besides being too
near 10th Street
well yeah apart from that it doesn't
really have any very close neighbors on
the on the map so the closest that you
get is I don't know maybe that red one
maybe but I would be really I'd be very
wary of just using that as my guess
because it's also pretty darn close to a
blue point and also not so far from the
green point mmm that's a good point so
this whole nearest-neighbor thing
doesn't quite work in this case when
you've got a bunch of neighbors that are
saying different things and they're all
kind of close to you so any clever way
we might get around this I would say
move the black dot do you know no no
we're not allowed to do that we tried
that before it seems it seems like it
would be helpful no no they're federal
laws against the thing I was gonna say
yeah so alright so short of that maybe
maybe we just need to look at a bigger
context ah that makes sense so you're
saying my little nearest neighbor thing
sort of worked but the problem was I
started out with examples that were you
know very clearly in a neighborhood and
now I'm in a place where I'm not so sure
about the neighborhood so I should let I
should look at more of my neighbors than
just the closest one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
