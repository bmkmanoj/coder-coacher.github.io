is part of the definition of one of the
most common forms of patient-centered
care the patient-centered medical home
elsewhere a key culprit in creating
these coordination problems has been
paper records they can physically be in
only one place and are not easily shared
even if shared they may not be easily
understood due to legibility issues or
differences among physicians in the
terms they use to describe the same
thing most of Marla's specialists use
paper records until recently here in the
US most physicians use them this is
rapidly changing because of the new
federal policies will explain in lesson
2 electronic records and data sharing
can help coordinate care here's data
from a recent survey of physicians who
are using these technologies and they
substantially agree that it helps
improve communication more available
data interestingly and importantly both
pcps and specialists with electronic
records say care is more coordinated and
communications are improved presumably
because data is now immediately
available when and where it is needed as
the majority of these physicians
reported</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
