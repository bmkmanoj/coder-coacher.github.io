borrowed 100 shares from Joe
so that's indicated by this sort of
empty box here you sold those hundred
shares to Lisa so now you have $10,000
in your account but you still owe Joe
those hundred shares let's suppose that
since that time IBM has dropped in price
and now it's selling at $90 you can make
a profit from that and you want to go
ahead and exit so you approach Lisa and
say hey can I buy those hundred shares
back and she says no I want to keep IBM
well that's a little bit of a problem
but fortunately there's lots of people
who have shares of IBM and would be
willing to sell them to you so Lisa is
now out of the picture and not part of
this transaction anymore but there's
somebody else out there Nate who's got a
hundred shares and he's willing to sell
them so you buy a hundred shares from
Nate and give them back to Joe so your
obligation to Joe is now completed IBM
was selling at $90 so you had to give
Joe $9,000 but remember you had $10,000
so the net result after everything is
said and done is you've got a thousand
dollars and you don't have any
obligation any longer - Joe so that's
how short selling works now I
personalized this story by talking about
Joe and Lisa and Nate and so on in
reality you don't have to make these
personal agreements with any of these
people
your broker makes all that happen your
broker is sitting here in between all
those actors and making all this happen
for you well this all sounds wonderful
doesn't it what can go wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
