in our units on different types of
expressions we've been learning the
skills need to perform operations on
polynomials rational expressions and now
radicals the last operation we need to
learn for radicals is division we can
think of the division of two radicals as
a fraction will have root 2 divided by
root 5 but for radical expressions we
don't want a radical to appear in the
denominator there are a few reasons why
we want to change this first it's
typically easier to approximate this
division if we divide by an integer here
rather than a radical secondly we can
determine if expressions are equivalent
to other expressions by changing what
this fraction looks like keep in mind
that when we rationalize the denominator
we're going to change what the fraction
looks like but we won't change its value
what do you think we can multiply the
numerator and denominator by so that we
have a denominator without a radical we
want to multiply by a form of one here
so whatever we multiply this denominator
by we need also multiply this numerator
