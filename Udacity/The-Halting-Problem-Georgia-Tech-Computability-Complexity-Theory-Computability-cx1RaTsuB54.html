as we have seen not being able to tell
whether a program will halt or not plays
a central role in the diagonalization
paradox and it's at least partly
intuitive that we can't tell whether a
program is just taking a long time or if
it will run forever it shouldn't be
surprising then that given an arbitrary
program input pair we can't decide
whether the program will halt on that
input but actually the situation is much
more extreme we can even decide if a
program will halt when it is given no
input at all just the empty string let's
go ahead and prove this the language of
descriptions of Turing machines that
halt on the empty string is undecidable
will do this by reducing from the
diagonal language that is will show that
the halting problem is at least as hard
as the diagonal problem here is one of
many possible reductions the reduction
creates a machine n that simply ignores
the input and then runs the machine M on
itself if M rejects then n is going to
loop otherwise and accepts note that
because we're switching from a language
about accepting to a language about
halting we have to return a rejecting
non acceptance into a looping one the
end result here is that if M accepts its
own description then n accepts every
string the empty one in particular on
the other hand if M either rejects or
loops on itself then n will loop a
decider for the halting problem could
tell the difference between accepting
everything and looping on everything so
the reduction is complete at this point
it might seem that we've just done a bit
of symbol manipulation but let's step
back and realize what we've just seen
we showed the no Turing machine can tell
whether or not a computer program will
halt or remain in a loop forever this is
a problem that we care about and we
can't solve it on a Turing machine or
any other kind of computer you can solve
the halting problem on your iPhone you
can solve the halting problem on your
desktop no matter how many cores you
have you can solve the halting problem
in the cloud even if someone
it's a quantum computer it still won't
be able to solve the halting problem to
misquote Nick Selby if you want to solve
the halting problem you're a Georgia
Tech but you still can't do that it's
not just a halting problem we can't
solve but we can't determine pretty much
anything about what a computer does
let's keep going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
