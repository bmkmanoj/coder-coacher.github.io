again we're going back to recognition
now remember before we're talking about
supervised classification supervised
classification is I give you a bunch of
labeled examples I typically referred to
as training examples and you're supposed
to come up with a function that will
label some new examples and we showed
this one where we have a bunch of
hand-drawn fours and hand-drawn nines
and the idea was given some new input is
it a four or is it a night the idea was
since we know what the desired labels
are from the training data we're going
to try to build a classifier that's
going to minimize the expected miss
classification or minimize our risk
alright and we talked about that there
were two strategies one was called
generative where we probably model each
of the classes and then somehow pick
them we'll talk about that again just
for a second and then we there is
discriminative and discriminative says I
don't care so much about modeling the
classes what I care about is modeling
some sort of boundary between the
classes and that makes it easier to make
some decisions so we talked about the
risk of a particular decision as being
if you're making a particular decision
what's the probability that that
decision is wrong and with the cost of
making that wrong decision so for
example let's suppose that I'm going to
label something as a 4 well if I'm going
to label it's a four what's the risk
associated with it being of 4 well that
risk would be well you know what's the
probability that it's actually a 9 ok
and what's the cost to me of calling a 9
of four alright so that's the risk of
labeling something of four right because
it actually might have been a nine and
what's the cost likewise suppose I'm
going to label something a nine what's
the risk of labeling something a nine
well the risk of labeling something a
nine is the probability that was
actually a four times the cost of
labeling something of four as an eye all
right and where should my decision
boundary be well my decision boundaries
should be that the risk of either
decision would be the same ok and that
was the idea of the general model and so
that's what's being shown here is so
here all my real for so i'm pretty sure
that they're for so I'm going to call
them for us but as I'm getting over to
the other
side it might be a nine here all my
nines and as I'm getting close over here
it might be a 4 and this boundary in the
middle that's where the risk is the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
