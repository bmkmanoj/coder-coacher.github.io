plays a role in terms of how successful
the devil's transformation can be and I
think this is where it's important to
understand that as a devil's
practitioner you are taking a set of
software development and operational
practices as a base but what sure but
maybe what you are really doing is
you're doing some community organization
and so I think it's important to
understand that your role is one of
someone who is promoting change and this
is different from being a change agent
so often people think of themselves as
I'm the change agent and so sorry change
agents but the way that that role then
gets played is you run you run around
inside the organization seeking
permission for change and so in in a
very hierarchical organization you know
the pattern that that's going to take is
you're in an organizational silo you see
that maybe you can reach out to the silo
right next to you but you're only path
for communication is straight up maybe
up to the point at which there's two
people playing golf right and then all
the way back down to the bottom and and
that takes time it's frustrating and
often it you go unheard I think the real
limitation there is the limitation of
language so I think it's maybe more
important inside of inside of inside an
organization that is heavily silo door
sort of heavily heavily structured in
that way to take actions that support
your goals in ways that are that are
safe but that can also that can also
communicate value for instance even in
the strongest silo when you can take
when you can identify real
organizational pinpoints and take a step
toward alleviating them and in today's
world these can be done using open
source projects there's there many ways
in which they can be of these these
problems can be approached with a
lightweight experiment that's sort of
low-cost I think that's when you you are
having now a conversation that isn't one
organizational structure on its face but
it's one about value I think that what
you're doing is you're changing your
relationship to the organization from
one of permission seeking to one of
value seeking and I think when you make
that fundamental change internally and
you use that and use that language and
you take actions to support it people
will join you i have i've seen a lot of
very siloed structured organizations but
i have never found the person inside
them that said i do not want to get to
the big bag of money at the end of my
sort of company journey everyone wants
to be successful everyone wants to be
happy and often what we're trying to do
is we're trying to figure out the right
way to match the solution that we see to
the desire that they're seeking and I
think when you can do that it's it's
both magical and it's hugely valuable
and and and at that point the
organizational components really
disappear because now we're talking
about value I don't want to pretend that
organizational structure doesn't exist
and they don't want to pretend that
there aren't organizations in which
certain kinds of permission are going to
be required you have to be very careful
about where you choose in your
organization to test these waters
people's security concerns are valid
what goes into a build how a bill gets
out in the world how software gets
created people care deeply about these
things and often the structure that
exists around them is there for a reason
so so choose carefully and choose wisely
where the goal is not to get you tilting
at windmills the goal is to take like
clear responsible steps toward
alleviating the problems that you see
using the tooling that you're going to
learn in this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
