so being in the version space just means
that you're consistent with the data
that you see right good okay so we
should be able to very quickly go
through this so x1 just copy x1 over
well if we look at the training data in
the first case x1 is 0 and the output is
0 second case x1 is 1 and the output is
1 so that is in fact consistent with
just always copying x1 so that is right
right and then without even having to
think about it since x1 is in the
version space doing the opposite of x1
can't possibly be in the version space
agreed so we can skip that looking at x2
we can see that in the first case you go
x2 0 C of X is 0 there so that's looking
good that's consistent so far but then
in the next row you get 0 and then you
get the opposite of 0 you get 1 the
complement of 0 so that definitely is
inconsistent with just copying over x2
so we can't have x2 and by very similar
reasoning you can't have the opposite of
x2 agreed
ok so true is clearly not consistent
because we got a 0 once and one once and
by the same argument false is not
consistent because we got a 0 once and a
1 once now or it's not clear I probably
could have been clear about this but
here zeroes and fossils are the same
thing and ones and throughs are the same
thing right just like an C okay I just
assume everything you do is written in C
Michael so in fact there's a see right
up there at the top of the at the top of
the slide yeah so I feel like I should
do this now I understand what's going on
right now it's in C much better ok
so or or means if either one of them is
true then you say yes and that's
actually consistent with or yep but it
is not consistent with and because 1 and
0 would be 0 not 1 the second case XOR
well I already know it's consistent with
XOR because I know that that's the
target concept yeah and then equiv would
be not consistent though interestingly
not equivalent would be consistent yes
because not equivalent is XOR no yeah
that's right all right so that's yeah
that's it x1 or an XOR excellent cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
