printing or a catchphrase is a
complexity is free I don't know if you
want to say anything about that I think
that's an interesting one it's so what
does that mean to you so that to me
means you can get as complex as you want
with an object and you can go as crazy
as you want I've seen people do stools
that were replicated seafoam because
they could 3d print them and there's no
other way you could ever manufacture
that now you can and I think really what
that means all stood is complexity
something that we could tend to put into
something and we tend to make things
over complicated because now that we can
and now it's kind of the time where the
wave hits the end right and you have to
look back and say again you know what's
the best way to make this and how do you
make something that could be really
complex very simplistic because now we
had the technology to do it and the
design software so easy right right i
mean i've heard of experiments were they
like evolve designs and they'll say well
now that we can build it in any shape we
want let's just start putting out
different designs and have a computer
analyze and see which the best one is so
that sounds really interesting with 3d
printing I mean the future could be very
very baroque you could have your face on
every single object in your house if you
wanted to but that's one of those
questions that keeps coming up is yeah
is how do you scale that back and say
well do I really need my face on a
doorknob is that the best corn AB there
is you know to be able to grab my head
and it's probably not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
