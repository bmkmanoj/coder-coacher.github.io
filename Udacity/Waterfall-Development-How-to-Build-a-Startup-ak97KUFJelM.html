doing waterfall development waterfall
development is just a step by step
process that says we marketing rights
requirements of what the product should
do engineering takes that and translates
them into features engineering then
designs the product either codes it or
builds the hardware they test it and
then the men maintain them this is kind
of a waterfall lifecycle step by step
but if you really look at this there's
an implicit fallacy that no one ever
noticed for 40 years to write the
requirements and do the design assumes
on day one
you know the problem or need the
customer has let me say it again
waterfall development assumes you
understand the customer problem and need
on day one now in a large company with
existing customers existing products
existing sales channel you know what
this might actually be true but in most
startups all you have is the founders
vision and what you tend to do in a
start-up is confuse a faith-based vision
with customer facts about problems and
needs and what happens the consequence
of assuming you know the customer
problem means you assume you know every
possible feature to ship on day one so
therefore you shut the door and you
start implementing and instead of just
implementing a piece at a time you
actually implement every possible
feature you could think about for
version one oh the irony is that we now
know somewhere between 85 and 90 percent
of most software product features are
unwanted and unneeded by customers
that's an enormous amount of waste of
time and money that ends up on the floor
we now know that waterfall and product
management execution on two knowns is
just kind of the wrong way to approach
it in a start-up makes all the sense in
the world in a large company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
