that I just made that I would like to
show you a few real-world examples of
architectures that kind of went astray
the first example I want to use is an
example from the Linux kernel actually
from an earlier version of the Linux
kernel a research group studied the
documentation of Linux and also
interviewed several Linux developers and
by doing that they were able to come up
with a software architecture of Linux at
different levels of abstraction so the
one that I'm showing you here on the
left is the software architecture at the
level of Linux main subsystems so this
is the prescriptive architecture of
Linux at the level of Linux main
subsystems so the researchers have
they're identifying this architecture
they showed it to the developers and the
developers agreed that there was indeed
the architecture of the system the
researchers then studied the source code
of Linux and reversed engineering its
actual architecture so the architecture
has implemented its descriptive
architecture and this one here on the
right is the result and as you can see
they found a number of differences or
violations between the prescriptive
architecture and the descriptive
architecture in particular if you look
at this architecture we can see that
pretty much everything talks to
everything else which is in general not
a good thing and in addition to that
there are also several things that don't
really make much sense for example the
library calls the file system and also
the network interface which doesn't make
much sense another thing that is kind of
weird is the fact that the file system
calls the kernel initialization code
which is also a little bit weird so
basically the bottom line here is that
not even the developers realize how the
actual architecture of the system was
and how it was different from the
architecture they had conceived and in
fact another interesting thing here is
the reaction of the developers when they
were shown the actual architecture so
basically they justify the differences
by saying things such as well you know
it had to be done fast and therefore I
changed it and then I didn't have time
to go back and update the documentation
and things of this sort and by the way
these are exactly some of the reasons
that we mentioned early on in the lesson
for the discrepancy between prescriptive
and descriptive software architecture so
one last thing that I want to mention
here as an aside and we can get back to
that later is the fact that you can
probably clearly show how representing
software architectures graphically can
be extremely useful because it allows
for easily seen the structure of the
system
look at different views identify
problematic points and so on and we will
see how that can be useful in many cases
also later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
