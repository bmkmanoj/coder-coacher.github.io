make lighting calculations not take an
incredible amount of time in this lesson
we're going to take an extremely
high-level view of how objects get
rendered by a graphics accelerator this
graphics hardware is usually called the
GPU for graphics processing unit a GPU
uses a rendering process called
rasterization or scan conversion which
is optimized to use the simplifications
i've outlined let's look at one
rendering pipeline from end to end the
idea of a pipeline is to treat each
object separately the first step is
simply that the application sends
objects to the GPU what objects
typically 3d triangles each triangle is
defined by the full locations of its
three points an application converts a
cube and to just a few triangles a
sphere gets turned into a bunch of
triangles so in the first step the
application decides what triangles to
send down the pipeline in the second
stage of the pipeline these triangles
are modified by the cameras view of the
world along with whatever modeling
transform is applied a modeling
transform is a way to modify the
location orientation and even the size
of a part for example if you were
rendering a bouncing ball the balls
modeling transform each frame would move
the ball to a different location along
its path the effect of the camera view
is clear enough after the object is
moved to its location for the frame is
it still in view of the camera that is
is the object inside the view frustum if
not then we're done with this object
since it won't affect any pixels on the
screen in this case we say the object
was fully clipped so here this cube is
fully clipped since it's outside of the
view frustum the camera and modeling
transforms compute the location of each
triangle on the screen if the triangle
is partially or fully inside the frustum
the three points of the triangle on the
screen are then used in a process called
rasterization if a triangles slightly
off the screen it gets clipped and is
turned into more triangles this process
identifies all the pixels whose centers
are inside the triangle in other words
it fills in the triangle so
rasterization here has found that this
triangle covers the pixel centers in
these various places these locations are
then used to show the image of the
triangle on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
