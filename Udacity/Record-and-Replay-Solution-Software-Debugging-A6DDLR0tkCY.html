because we already have a template up
here so again we have an index into the
list of safe commands which we call
saved command index so at this moment we
are in replay mode and while we are in
replay mode the original input command
function should no longer be called all
the commands should now come from the
saved commands in here let's see how
this works and we get the same set of
commands now being read from the saved
commands variable you read a program
that is outside of the web page one
would now go and store the safe commands
content violently say in a file for
recording and for replaying one would
read this from a file for programs that
take text-based commands recording and
replaying input is fairly easy to
realize however as it comes to a
producing graphical user interaction it
becomes hard to decide what kind of
events to record and to replay suppose
you have a graphical user interface for
web browser you have kept your replay to
that interposes itself between the user
and the program and stores all events
coming from the user in an event log
such that they can be later replayed the
problem is what is the abstraction level
you're going to choose for your events
you could for instance go and record
mouse clicks together with the
coordinates of the mouse pointer this is
fairly easy to record so for instance
you could go and click here on search at
the position say 100 x + 300 why or you
could enter some text while the cursor
is in the position 250 or click here on
the file menu or here down on this roll
down menu and of course all of these
then go into the event log the problem
is that for replaying you need to have
the exact same position of every element
at the very same position on the screen
now suppose your screen resolution
changes or the font size changes then
some of the elements will still be more
or less in their original position but
others won't me neither a mouse click
which has previously activated a
particular button on the screen will no
longer work likewise if the position of
simple immense change
then as well the recorded events will no
longer work also timing can become an
issue suppose you record it a click on
this drop-down menu and half a second
later when the drop down menu appeared
you clicked on one of the elements in
here so far so good this is what you
record it but now when you re playing
and in particular when you're playing
something from a web page it may be that
there's delays and the drop down menu
will not appear on time and then you'd
be clicking somewhere completely
different when replaying the recorded
events which stipulate that after half a
second you'd click in this very position
finally of course the program itself may
change if the surgery button is moved
from down here to up here then again
replaying the event log based on
absolute coordinates will click in the
wrong position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
