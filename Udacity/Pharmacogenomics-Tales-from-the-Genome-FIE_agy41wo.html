sole difference from two people
consuming the same amount of alcohol the
same input but only one person shows the
alcohol flush reaction while the other
person doesn't we have the same input
but a different output and all due to a
difference in the genetic code in theory
this phenomenon exists for virtually any
drug that humans interact with not just
alcohol while pharmacology is defined as
the science of drugs that deals with
their composition uses and effects
pharmacogenomics is the study of how a
person's genome affects the way they
respond to drugs the goal of
pharmacogenomics is to learn ahead of
time with the best drug or the best dose
of a drug will be for a person to better
catalogue new information that is
uncovered all the time the
pharmacogenomics knowledge base or
pharmgkb was founded and created as an
interactive tool for researchers to
investigate how genetic variation
affects drug response both with regards
to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
simply type in the name of a gene that
affects the pharmacokinetic or dynamic
effect of a drug and pull up the entry
describing what is known about it here
you can see right here the very allele
that we just learned about position 15
10 of the coding region the change from
guanine to adenine we can even see the s
and V variant with the s and V IDRs 671
and we can click on that variant and see
exactly what the changes glutamate to
lysine we can even use pharmgkb to
search for drugs we should have a lot
more information for us about the drug
and its effects on the body as well as
all of the alleles that affect its
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
we'll learn more about warfarin later in
the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
