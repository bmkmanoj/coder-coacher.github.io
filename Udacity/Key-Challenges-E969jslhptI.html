going to face when we have this task of
managing cybersecurity for the
organization that we're talking about we
said we have to know what are the assets
that are of value and are they under
risk also sort of understand the threats
and how serious are those threats so
when you talk about risk actually we're
going to look at this a little bit more
but risk is really the likelihood of an
attack it's a probability of an attack
it's not the worst case what the worst
can happen it's sort of trying to
compute the likely case in some sense so
continuing with the challenges even if I
sort of identify my assets and read
source and perhaps the likelihood of
attacks then I have to worry about well
what can I do about it what sort of
solutions are out there or controls that
exist deciding that of course is a
challenge we did talk about cost-benefit
and the trade-offs that are there when
you think about deploying various
solutions so of course we want to do
into a cost effective manner it sounds
simple but doing that again is a serious
challenge obviously we have to argue
that the cost is less than the reduction
in risk we're going to have finally we
know that when you look at sort of the
threat landscape and I think in the
context of database security we you know
did a question where we said you know
what are the threats external hackers or
insiders and we say in one of the
service insiders and unauthorized access
was ranked higher than the next earn
hackers so we have to of course
understand the people and the process
that we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
