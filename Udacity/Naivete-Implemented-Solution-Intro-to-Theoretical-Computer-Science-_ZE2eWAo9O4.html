first thing I do is assert that the
length of the graph is equal to the
length of the cover since we need the
same number of nodes of vertices in both
the cover and the graph he said and
equal to the length of the graph then so
we go through every element in the
adjacency matrix one by one and if that
element is set to one that is there as
an edge between those two vertices and
either the first vertice we're checking
is not equal to one that is it is not
part of the vertex cover or the second
vertex isn't then we return false
we check every single one of those and
if we fall through all of those then we
go ahead and return true and then it is
a valid vertex cover now for the naive
vertex cover algorithm what we do is
first for every assignment in a product
of zeros or ones that is of length and
that's what this product statement does
then if the validity check is true for
that assignment and that input graph
then we set the size to be the sum of
the number of ones in the assignments so
we add up all the elements in that list
all the zeros and ones
now if the minimum vertex cover is
greater than the size then we set that
to be the size we update it otherwise we
leave it alone
once we've looped through every possible
assignment and remember there are a lot
of possible assignments then we return
the minimum vertex cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
