want you to build a tool called bonsai
con for bonsai daikon or tiny daikon the
idea is to take a number of executions
like these and produce assertions that
is invariants that hold for all runs
observed for the starting point all I
want from you is ranges of variables as
you have seen them what bonds icon
should produce is a range of variable
values seen at the call and at the
return of each function here's an
example for for square root how this
should look like at the call of the
square root function X is always between
2 and 16 and the variable epsilon is
always 10 to the power of minus 7 and as
you can see I want you to output these
ranges and if the range has just one
value then I want this to be an equal
sign I want you to output these as
assertions that can be inserted
immediately into the code this would be
preconditions that hold when a function
is called but I also want you to report
post conditions that hold when the
function returns here we have the range
for the variable Y at the end of square
root and also the return value which I
gave this special name ret Gen value is
between queer root of 2 and square root
of 16 as seen for these 3 runs the
question is how do you get these ranges
the answer to that again is a tracing
function which allows us to record the
state of the program at every call and
at every return what you set up is a
special trace it function which gets the
current frame that executed the event
that's taking place and an argument
that's ristic a look at the event the
event is either call or return and
translates directly into these two
situations you'd like to monitor the
current frame tells you which code is
being executed frame dot F underscore
code dot Co underscore name gives you
the name of the function
that's execute in our case that would be
square root the frame dot F underscore
locals attribute is a dictionary that
gives you access to all local very
such as Y or X or EPS and finally if the
event is returned the argument that's
passed over here gives you the return
value so what you do is you run your
program with the trace function enable
you record the call and return events
you check for every single function
that's being called and it's called
and its returns you check all the
variables through frame F locals and
over time you record the ranges when the
execution is done you output the ranges
that you have observed in the beginning
first run where root of 2x is just 2
then X is between 2 &amp;amp; 4 and then X is
between 2 and 16 likewise for y where
the square root gets expanded over time
likewise for the return value where
again the range of return values extends
as more and more runs are observed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
