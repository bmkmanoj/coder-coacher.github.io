enough and in any case the number cards
is really irrelevant what's important is
the number of possible hands and the
number of possible results we get for
each type of hand then the rankings we
get for each so one per card does make
sense a thousand per card doesn't really
help that much now we're talking so here
we say at least expect to get ten
possible results for the least common
rank solis common is a straight flush
and if we said if we expect to get ten
straight flushes then probably we're not
going to get exactly ten but it's not
going to be off by that much if we
expect it only to get one straight flush
then maybe half the time we get zero and
half the time we get to and that would
be off by a lot that wouldn't be very
good but ten seems about right at least
we're in the right ballpark so if that's
the right answer here then what does
that translate over here well we can
just look up the probability we had that
on the previous page look up the
probability it's one about one in 60,000
or 66,000 and so if we have a little bit
more than 10 of each then that comes up
to 700,000 and that's a lot less than 52
factorial which is the total number of
permutations of the hands actually
permutations isn't that important a
better number would be the total number
of combinations but even the total
number of combinations is bigger than
700,000 so we're probably okay going
here and here's the code to calculate
the hand percentages so I give a default
value for n the number of deals that
we're going to do the default of 700,000
but you can put in as many as you want
and I should say don't try to run this
function here with 700,000 as the input
because it will take too long it should
take 20 or 30 seconds and running on our
servers we don't let you run that long
so put in a if you want to run it here
put in a smaller value for n say a
thousand or so or if you want to run it
on your own home machine you're welcome
to go ahead and do that so we make up a
vector of counts which starts with no
count for each of the nine possibility
and then we go through the deals and
what I'm going to do is deal ten hands
and
over 10 times and for each of those
hands i compute the ranking and then
increment the count for the ranking and
then I just print out the results so
when I hit run here's what the results
look like and if I want to compare them
to what we got from wikipedia i can go
ahead and do that so here you can see we
have two columns these are the results
as computed by our random sampling and
these are the results is computed by
exact math as shown in Wikipedia and you
can see they're pretty close in all
cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
