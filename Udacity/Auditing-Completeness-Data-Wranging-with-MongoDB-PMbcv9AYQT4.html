assess as my friend David Silverman is
fond of saying you don't know what you
don't know now in this discussion we're
not talking about individual fields
missing from a record instead we're
actually talking about missing records
that is to say trying to figure out when
it's an entire record that's gone
missing so the solution here is very
similar to the solution for accuracy
essentially we need reference data so
let me give you an example from
something I work with on a regular basis
I'm the director of education at MongoDB
in part of my role I'm responsible for
our certification program now we do
things a little bit differently than
some other technology companies in that
our certification exams are delivered
entirely online so in addition to a
completed exam record for every test
taker in delivering our exams online we
have to have a way of proctoring them to
ensure the security of the exam the way
we do that is through a web proctoring
solution where we capture video of the
test taker session we capture both video
of the test taker themselves using a
webcam as well as screen capture for
everything that's going on on the test
takers computer screen as they're taking
our exam what this means then is we have
three separate data stores that need to
agree with one another on a couple of
different things and here is where we
get to the completeness example they
must agree on the list of test takers
that is to say if there is a record for
a test taker in any one of these
databases there must be a record for
that same test taker in the other two
they also need to agree on the duration
of the exam session so the video here
and here should be approximately the
same length and it should agree with the
elapsed time that we recorded for a test
taker and of course these have to agree
approximately within some Epsilon now
you're probably thinking what if
somebody took an exam and the record
doesn't exist in any one of these three
databases well that's exactly right as I
mentioned at the beginning of this this
is a difficult problem to address
because we don't know what we don't know
in that case using the solution I've
just described we would not detect the
missing exam record some point of fact
we actually do a couple of things in
addition to this too
your completeness for our exam records
and those are essentially preventive
measures to make sure that we can't get
into a situation where we haven't
captured the appropriate exam data for a
given test taker so to wrap this up as
with much of data cleaning the means of
auditing completion is situation
specific it really depends on what the
data is that you are auditing and what
reference sources you have access to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
