that last quiz how to evaluate an
expression or a statement in an
environment but we've been assuming that
the environment which I said is kind of
like the world comes pre-prepared but
what if we want to build a new world
what if we want to set the values of
variables what if I want to determine
what the current temperature is here
I've written to code snippets one in
Python and one in JavaScript that do the
same thing and both of them extend or
create an environment they make a bigger
richer world that has new bindings of
values to variables here in Python we
assign the value zero to the variable X
and then we're going to print out X plus
1 that'll be one and over here in
JavaScript we use a var statement to
introduce the variable X and assign it
the value zero and then we write out
onto the web page X plus 1 which in an
incredible surprise move will also be
one we're going to want to handle
statements like these in our JavaScript
interpreter in order to build our web
browser so let's test our knowledge of
assignment statements with a brief quiz
so here I've written a fragment of
Python code that's going to print out
results to the screen based on these two
print statements in my fun what I'd like
you to do is determine which of the
following outputs could actually be
produced by this program and try to work
through it in your head and this quiz is
multiple multiple choice check each box
that corresponds to a string that could
be printed out if you were to run this
program in the Python interpreter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
