introduces the next big idea we need for
our web crawler which is structured data
and by the end of this unit you'll have
finished building a working web crawler
the closest thing we've seen so far to
structured data is the string data type
introduce the unit 1 and used in many of
the procedures in unit 2 a string is a
kind of structured data and that's
because we can break it down into its
characters the string is a sequence of
characters and we can operate on sub
sequences of the string what we could do
with strings was somewhat limited though
because the only thing we can put in a
string is a character so today we're
going to introduce the list datatype and
lists are much more powerful than
strings so whereas for a string all of
the elements had to be characters in a
list the elements can be anything we
want they could be characters they could
be strings they could be numbers they
could also be other lists so let's look
at an example when we created a string
we just put a sequence of characters
surrounded by either single or double
quotes so here's an example of a string
and we could store that string in a
variable by using an assignment with a
list instead of using quotes to identify
the list we use square brackets and the
elements are separated by commas and
just like with a string we can assign
the list that we created to a variable
so we'll store that list in the variable
P with a string we could use the square
brackets to select elements and when we
index element 0 we'll get the first
element of the string a sequence of that
character which is the character Y with
lists we can also use square brackets to
access elements so if we do P square
bracket 0 that will evaluate to the
first element of P which is the string
containing the single letter Y with
strings we saw that we could use the
colon inside the square brackets so
select a substring of more than one
character so here we're selecting from
position two through position four that
will give us the third and fourth
characters of the string which is the
subsequence the string BB we can do the
same thing with lists we can select from
position 2 to position 4 but instead of
returning a string it will return a list
containing the
elements so we'll give us a list of the
third and fourth element of the variable
P which is the list that we have here
so the general grammar for constructing
a list is to have a square bracket
followed by a list of any number of
expressions where the expressions are
separated by commas so we could create a
list using just two square brackets a
left bracket and a right bracket and
this would create a list containing zero
elements also known as the empty list we
could create a list containing one
element that would be the square
brackets with one element between them
here we've created a list containing
just one element which is the number
three or we could create a list with
many elements as we did in the first
example where we have all of these
strings separated by commas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
