learning problem isn't really that
crisply defined we can define a basic
clustering problem and be somewhat crisp
about it so that's what I want to do
next I want to say that one of the
classic unsupervised problems is
clustering taking a set of objects and
putting them into groups and so here's
what we're gonna assume we're going to
assume that we're given some set of
objects X and we're given information
about how they relate to each other in
the form of inter object distances so
we're gonna assume that for objects x
and y and the set of objects we have d
XY which is the same as d YX which says
how far apart they are in some space now
they don't actually have to be in some
metric space they just need to have this
this distance matrix D defined so that
makes sense let me ask you see so they
didn't have to be in a metric space oh
you mean it literally does not have to
be a real distance it doesn't have to be
a symmetric yeah I don't I don't think
we're gonna depend on that I think we
just need some kind of way of measuring
how far apart things are and it doesn't
mean that they are embedded in some two
dimensional space or three dimensional
space
there's just numbers that relate them to
one another so they don't have to obey
the triangle inequality for example I
don't think so
I don't think we're gonna depend on that
in any way ok so this is just like an in
because everything is like KN where you
have this notion of similarity and
distance and that's where your domain
knowledge is so you've got a bunch of
objects and your domain knowledge is
these distances these similarities
between objects exactly right and in
fact it's it's surprisingly similar to K
and n in that they surprisingly depend
on similar nests hmm so that's good so
can is similar to everything so its
distance is small to all things wow that
is very minute all right so that's
that's the input and the output that a
clustering algorithm needs to to create
is a partition which is to say we're
gonna I'll write it this way that P of P
sub D the partition function defined for
some particular distance set D for some
object X is just going to be some label
but it's such that if x and y are going
to be assigned to the same cluster the
same partition then they're going to
have the same output of this PD function
okay what would be a trivial clustering
algorithm based on this definition right
it's taking as input the objects and the
distances and then it spits out
partitions
a trivial one would be well a trivial
one would be put everything in the same
partition yeah so that would be one so
that would be that would look like this
peed for all X in the set of objects PD
of X equals let's say 1 so that means
that all objects are in partition 1
we're all humans that's right okay
here's another trivial one
every single object is in its own
partition yes good that's the other one
I was thinking of which maybe we could
write like this we just use the object
name itself as the name of the cluster
and now every object is in its own
cluster now we didn't define as part of
this this problem definition whether we
should like the one where everybody's in
the same cluster or the one everyone's
the different clusters are something in
between it's not really in the in this
definition at this level of detail hmm
well that's fine I mean we can all be
humans and we can all be unique
snowflakes at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
