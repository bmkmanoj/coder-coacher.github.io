something the targets fixed and only the
position changes when you turn the
camera to the left you're fixed in
position and the target changes when
you're zooming in you're not doing any
kind of change because you're just
changing the field of view when you pan
you're moving the camera perpendicular
to the way it's facing so both the
target and position change in fact
controlling where the target location is
can be a somewhat frustrating part of
using various graphics modelers if you
pan and then orbit you're now orbiting
around some different target location
which may not have been what was
intended note that I didn't ask about
the effect of dahling on the target in
position dolly certainly changes the
position but it's up to the program
whether to change the target in this
case if the control also moves the
target it's likely you're walking
forward and don't particularly care
where the target is located if the
target doesn't change it's like you're
walking towards an object and perhaps
slow down as you approach it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
