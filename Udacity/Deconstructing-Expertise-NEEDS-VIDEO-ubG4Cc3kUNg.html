deconstructing your own expertise but
there's 3 i'd like to talk about now
once you've come up with your learning
objective the best way to deconstruct
your own expertise is to actually do the
thing so if your lesson is on
multiplication you should be doing lots
of multiplication but as you do you
should be focusing on your own attention
what are you thinking about what are you
paying attention to you'll gain a lot of
insights this way another helpful
technique is creating what's called
mental maps which is just a web of
related ideas and as you're creating a
mental map the best thing to focus on is
the schema what connections are you
drawing that novices may not finally a
technique that I find incredibly useful
is reading about history even for
something as seemingly simple as
multiplication there is a rich history
it took centuries to even come up with
the place value system and when you
think about why that is you start to
respect some of the experts blind spot
that you may not have noticed otherwise
in the reading segment that follows I'll
go through all three of these in a
little more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
