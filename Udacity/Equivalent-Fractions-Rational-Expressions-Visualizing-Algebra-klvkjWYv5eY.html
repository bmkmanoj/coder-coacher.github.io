plus 3 divided by P plus 3 the
denominator here is missing a factor a P
plus 3 this is the one factor we need in
order to change our denominator into the
LCD for our second fraction we multiply
by P minus 1 divided by P minus 1 and
this denominator p minus 1 is the
missing factor we need in order to get
the LCD now we multiply these two
numerators together and these two
denominators together this gives us our
new first equivalent fraction we do the
same process for the second fraction to
get this these two denominators may look
different but they're really the same we
know the order of the factors don't
matter because it's multiplication now
that the two fractions have like
denominators we can simply add the
numerators together we add the like
terms the peas and the constants 1p and
1p would equal to P and positive 3 and
negative 1 would equal positive 2 now
that we're here we should ask ourselves
are we done well we added two things in
a numerator together so we have a new
numerator entirely we want to see if we
can factor it if possible and it turns
out we can we can take out a two to have
2 times P plus 1 but this doesn't really
help us we can't cancel a factor of P
plus 1 since another factor of P plus 1
does not appear in the denominator so
the answer is yes we're done and here's
the addition of these two rational
expressions now this is some algebra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
