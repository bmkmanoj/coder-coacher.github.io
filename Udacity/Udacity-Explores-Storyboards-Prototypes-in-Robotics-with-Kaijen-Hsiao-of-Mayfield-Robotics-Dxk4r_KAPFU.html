for mixing concepts that even just
thinking about it people are not
interested in you might have been
interested in because you're an engineer
and that's interesting to you but
actually to most consumers that idea is
not interesting at all or you know
general industrial design concepts is
that a compelling look for the robot at
all or do people think that's actually
ugly or scary so the thing about
storyboards is that a lot of people
can't necessarily imagine what the
robots actually going to be like based
just on the storyboard and so you show
them a storyboard and they fill in the
rest of their imagination and sometimes
that's not anything like what the robot
will actually be and so you get some
great feedback on general concepts but
you do also have to take it with a grain
of salt because sometimes something is
very compelling in a storyboard later on
when it's flushed out and the robot
isn't necessarily as compelling as
people thought it would be so if you
have corporate prototypes
that's totally enough to get out there
and start talking to people about
concepts there's a famous story about
how Kiva the robots in Amazon where
houses these days which you know it grew
to be a company that was sold for I
think billions of dollars they started
out talking to VCS with just sock
puppets they had sock puppets in the
concept and they showed that they had
the team that could build this thing and
that was enough to get initial funding
to do the thing it's important to gauge
interest in what you're building before
you start building so before you spend a
lot of time building something that
nobody wants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
