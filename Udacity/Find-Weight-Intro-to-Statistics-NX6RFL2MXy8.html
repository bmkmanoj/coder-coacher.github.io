the last couple of days on Facebook a
discussion broke out what Sebastian's
weight is and I decided rather than
telling people how much I weigh I turn
this into statistics and upfront I want
you to put everything together we've
done so far using programming and since
programming has been optional in this
class consider this unit optional but
it'd be great if you had a chance to try
it it's not that hard and in the end of
a day you've know something about me
that I really discuss in public so a
comment I made in class on Facebook a
discussion erupted in our Facebook stats
101 discussion group what my actual
weight is and here is the forum that I
posted where our students to submit
their best estimate how much I weigh in
kilograms and also to submit how much
they thought I weighed a year ago and
within a few hours there was a good
number of guesses including this one
over here that's about as much as the
planet Pluto ways and also some negative
guesses these are about the negative
weight of fruit all each but other than
that there were lots of really good
guesses and you can see in kilograms
some people thing away 80 or 65 other
things away 250 so our clip guesses and
edit them into a large list called
weight there's just below 100 of those
and now I want to do statistics on those
the very first thing I did is I printed
the mean estimate and it turns out to be
negative it's minus 2 to the 1 0 to the
10 to the 20th and it's a typical
situation in statistics when you look at
those numbers most of them are actually
pretty good guesses but these extreme
guesses of 10 to the 22 or minus 10 to
the 22 over here completely affect and
screw up the actual statistics
now you've learned how to deal with this
you know everything about statistics
what I want you to do is to now code a
piece of software called calculate
weight that does three things and I
think you can do all three of them
yourself first I want you to move the
outliers by only extracting data between
the lower and upper quartile it turns
out the number of data points make it
well-defined for the low and upper
quartile is in all test cases we run
through will have a well-defined number
of data points and all the test cases we
will be using will have the property
that the low and upper quarter are well
defined elements then I want you to fit
a Gaussian using the maximum likelihood
estimator and from that I want you to
compute the value X that corresponds to
the standard score Z so I'm giving you
not just the weight statistics the
weight data but also where my extra
weight is if you plug in the standard
score of minus two which is two standard
deviations below the mean of the data of
people estimated you'll find out my
extra weight this morning that I took
this morning it's amazingly accurate for
differently the data that you guys
provided for this was overestimating my
weight I'm happy to report by two
standard deviations so all these
formulas are known and I think if all
the coding skills necessary from the
past to fill these gaps obviously the
first step is the hardest and when
you're done with it
this command over here will give you the
correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
