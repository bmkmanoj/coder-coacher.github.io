scarcity of IP addresses is network
address translation this also helps
mobile devices quickly join an exit
local area networks or lands as would
happen as you walk by a row of
restaurants and coffee shops with your
phone to be concrete and simple let's
suppose that you have a combined modem /
router connected to the Internet in your
home now within your home you can create
a private IP network using the network
ID reserved for such a situation
specifically anything that starts with
192.168 typically the modem / router
will allocate IPs through a protocol
called dynamic host configuration or
DHCP let's say that your computer gets
the address 192.168.1.1 hundred and your
printer gets 192.168.1.1 on one your
neighbor might also have a local area
network with a private IP address space
and maybe his printer and computer get
the same addresses this turns out to be
ok remember that the network layer is
dependent on the link layer and
everything ultimately gets sent through
the link layer protocol so let's say
that your computer knows the IP address
of the printer but not its MAC address
to find it the computer broadcasts an
address resolution protocol or ARP
packet so the whole link network asking
who has the IP address 192.168.1.1 on
one the printer will respond with its
MAC address and then we're good to go
because the ARP is sent by broadcast
over the link layer network
it never exits your private network in
your home so there's no possibility of
your pictures ending up on your
neighbor's printer or some such
embarrassing circumstance of course you
want to be able to do more than just
connect to other things around the house
you want to be able to connect to cool
websites like Udacity let's connect your
modem to the Internet and give it the IP
98.2 5 1.1 19 to 49 when you ask your
computer to send a packet to Udacity IP
your computer will not find the matching
IP in its routing table so we'll send
the packet to the default gateway in
this case your router the router will
also not find the IP in its table it
will really only know about the private
IPs and so it will forward the packet on
to its default gateway on the wide area
network the internet as a parenthetical
note here I should say that packet is
we used the network layer for discrete
chunks of data that get passed around
eventually the packet will reach the
Udacity site but it's not clear how you
dasa T should send the information back
it can't use the local IP address
because there's no way to tell whether
it should send the information back to
your computer or to your neighbors
so instead your router actually swaps
out your IP address for its own this way
Udacity can just swap the source and IP
addresses and then send that packet back
along with the data the modem then just
needs to change the destination IP back
to your computer and then route it along
the private network in your home this is
a little trickier and involves changing
parts of the transport layer which we'll
discuss later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
