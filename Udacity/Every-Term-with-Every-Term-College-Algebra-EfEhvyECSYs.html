we saw that when you're multiplying two
polynomials together we actually end up
using the distributive property a couple
of times multiplying every term in the
first expression by every term in the
second expression so we're taking every
possible combination of pairs of terms
using one from the first expression and
one from the second expression this is
actually a general rule that applies to
multiply any pair of polynomials
regardless of how long it is so we could
use this trick even if there were 10
terms inside the first set of
parentheses and three terms inside the
second set of parentheses or any other
number of terms in either one in any
situation like this we just need to go
through one by one each of the terms
inside the first set of parentheses and
multiply them by the terms over here so
in this case we start with X and we say
x times the first term over here which
is X so we have x times X and the second
thing we do is multiply X by the next
term in the second set of parentheses x
times negative 2 then since we've
exhausted all the terms inside the
second set of parentheses we can move to
the next factor inside the first set of
parentheses which is 55 applies to the
first term in the second set of
parentheses which is X and then also to
the second term which is negative 2 so
stepping one by one through the terms
inside the first set of parentheses and
applying them each to all of the terms
set the second parentheses before moving
on to the next term in the first set of
parentheses is a great way to make sure
that you have actually covered all of
your bases and made all the combinations
of pairs of terms that you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
