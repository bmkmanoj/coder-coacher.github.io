dilemma again you may recall this
picture vaguely let's add to this the
min max or security level profile so for
prisoner's dilemma what is the min max
and then become it is indeed D comma D
right so this is the value that you can
guarantee yourself against a malicious
adversary malicious average is going to
defect on you and the best thing you can
do in that case is to defect yourself
yep agree agreed agreed
all right so now let's take a look at
the intersection of the following two
regions there's this nice yellow region
that we've already got and then we've
got a new region that's defined by this
min Max point this min-max profile so
the region that is above and to the
right of this of this min Max point
mm-hmm so that's the region this this
region all right we already said that
this yellow region is called a feasible
region so I'm thinking we can call this
other region the acceptable region and
it's and what I mean by that is if you
think about it payoffs in this region
are smooth getting more than what smooth
can guarantee itself in an adversarial
situation and Curly getting more than
Curly could guarantee himself in an
adversarial situation so these are all
like you know better than it could be so
when I call it the preferable region the
preferable region it's preferable to not
being in this region mm-hmm the
intersection of these two is the
feasible preferable example bruisin
exactly it's kind of you know special
from the perspective that it is both
feasible and preferable and now we are
ready to state the folk theorem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
