algorithm called merge sort the overall
idea is that you split a huge array down
as much as possible and then over time
build it back up doing your comparisons
and sorting at each step along the way
the general idea of breaking up an array
sorting all the parts of it and then
building it back up again is called
divide and conquer
several efficient sorting algorithms
have this principle at their core ok
let's see how merge sort works with an
example first we break up the array into
a bunch of arrays with one element each
now we need to start building it back up
again you may wonder why the one
leftover element goes at the beginning
and not the end don't worry too much
about details like that they'll differ
depending on the implementation however
this step should only have arrays of
size two and size one left first
we compare these two elements to see
which one is smaller since one is
smaller it'll go first in our new array
and since 3 is bigger it'll go second
now we move on and do this with the next
pair of arrays again 7 is bigger than 0
so in our new array we put 0 in the
first spot and 7 in the second spot and
now we do this one last time
comparing the last two elements 10 and 2
and putting them in order in a new array
great that was easy enough now the last
thing we want to do is keep track of the
number of comparisons we did so we can
come back to it when we do our
efficiency calculation overall this step
took three comparisons each one in green
ok
we're running out of space so I'm going
to clear everything off except this
bottom row and move it on up now we're
going to combine the first two arrays
and the last two arrays and create an
array of three and an array of four now
these comparisons are a little more
complicated here we're comparing an
array with one element to an array with
two elements we know that the array on
the right is already sorted so the first
element of our new array
is either going to come from here or the
first element of this array it looks
like one is smaller so that'll be our
first element now we can move on to the
next element in this array and compare
it with this one since 3 is smaller than
8 we'll put 3 in this box now that we're
done with this array we can just take
anything that's left in the other one
and tack it on the end here great let's
move on to building this array so we're
gonna start out comparing the first two
elements of these arrays that's zero and
two since zero is less than two zero
becomes the first element in our new
array okay so now we move on to the next
element in this array which is seven and
compare that to two two is less than
seven so we put two in the new array we
repeat again checking seven against ten
and fill them in at the end of the array
accordingly how many comparisons did we
do in this step well if you count up all
the purple comparisons that leaves us
with five okay we're almost there we
just need to go through one more round
to get our completely sorted array this
is going to start just like it did in
the last round we start off by comparing
the first two elements of the two arrays
that we have so 1 &amp;amp; 0 since 0 is smaller
it ends up going in this array and we
get rid of it in the old array we move
on comparing 1 and 2 and end up with 1
being smaller so one fills in the spot
we compare again with 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; again with
3 &amp;amp; 7 and again with 8 &amp;amp; 7 and finally
we're done we have our newly sorted
array we need to keep track of the
number of comparisons we did in this
stuff so I'll write 6 comparisons off to
the side here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
