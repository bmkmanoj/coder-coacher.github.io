simple here let's try now giving a
precondition for sort okay what what do
you think is are the required conditions
in order for sort to execute I guess
depending on how you might want to write
your function we should say something
about having an empty
we need a non-empty set of our vector of
integers I guess you could have an empty
set of integers or an empty vector I'm
sorry of integers but you wouldn't get
anything meaningful back so it seems to
kind of fall in the same category with
the negative number and our square root
function may be does it matter
okay so Jared mentioned a couple things
here one is he did say that it was
important in our particular case to deal
with integers and what we're going to do
there is we're going to say as far as
far as our preconditions and
postconditions are concerned we're not
going to be concerned with the datatypes
of the input arguments and the output
results we're going to assume that the
signature took care of that and
ultimately when the program is can
turned into code the type checker on the
compiler is going to do that kind of
checking okay so we're not we're not
going to include in the precondition any
any statements about the types of things
okay and then the second thing that
Jared mentioned was what to do about
whether there was an uncertainty about
what to do in the case of an empty
vector mm-hmm okay
and he said if you give in an empty
vector you wouldn't get any meaningful
results back but I would come back and
say well isn't the sort of an empty
vector an empty vector it is okay so
it's meaningful it's a meaningful result
there now we could have a precondition
that said the length is greater than or
equal to one and we have a perfectly
good sort routine there but we can
stretch it make it a little bit more
general by saying that the sort of an
empty vector is an empty vector okay and
of course all of us are computer
scientists and as such we'd like to have
general solutions that work in as many
cases as we can deal with so in this
case we're going to go
the fact we're going to specify
something that will work on an empty an
empty vector and produce an empty result
so when you factor all those things in
what's the precondition of sort okay so
X must be a vector and but but that the
compiler is gonna take care of we're not
worried about that right just okay okay
what are the conditions on X that must
hold I don't know if there are any
that's right yeah if we are not
concerned about the type checking parts
of things then any input vector of
integers sort should be able to deal
with so in this case the precondition or
we could also say the precondition is
true that is the precondition always
holds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
