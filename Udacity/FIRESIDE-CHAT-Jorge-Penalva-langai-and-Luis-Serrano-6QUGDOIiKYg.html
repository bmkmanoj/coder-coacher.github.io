city's fireside chat as a school of
artificial intelligence today we're very
fortunate to have Jorge pandava
Jorge's an innovator in in artificial
intelligence in particular in the fields
of natural language processing he has
founded two companies sent EC's and Lang
Jie and well hello Jorge we're happy to
have you three yeah thank you very much
Udacity for having me in this fireside
chat and you have my pleasure thank you
and for any students watching right now
we invite you to ask any questions in
our youtube page and we're gonna get to
them later in the segment so Jorge tell
us a little bit more about yourself and
how is your journey towards towards
artificial intelligence in particular
towards towards NLP yeah so I'm an
electrical engineer I graduated in Spain
and then I took a masters in Chicago a
master's in computer science so the
master thesis of my of my master was
focused on artificial intelligence and
specifically in NLP I was I built a chat
board around Twitter conversations and I
realized about like the big opportunity
in the field of NLP how it was growing
but still how there was a lot of room
for research and innovation and that's
what led me to found the companies along
the way so first we started with a
product synthesis which basically is
focused on spanish-speaking
conversations we started the company in
Spain and we grow into Latin America
Mexico Colombia Chile with a product
whose main the main differentiator in
the product is basically understanding
the nuances in language in the different
variations of Spanish right and along
that way we realize about the
opportunity behind NLP in terms of
unsupervised AI so we build long ER
which is a platform where we apply and
supervised AI to understand any kind of
unstructured text data that's
interesting so let's let's take more
into that is our awareness students we
have learned supervised learning and
unsupervised learning and the NLP we've
seen so far is mostly supervised
learning right so in the context of your
work
tell us a bit more about
what is unsupervised learning and then
LP and one of the differences right yeah
so so supervised learning as you
probably know is focused on labelling
data building a training dataset and
then the model learns from that training
data so in the field of NLP a typical
example is a spam classification you
level each email as spam or not and the
mall is gonna learn how to classify
further emails into spam right
so with unsupervised AI de hour and
supervised machine learning the focus is
on okay we only have the data and we
don't have any training data with a lab
of the data we have to group it in ways
that make sense and can be useful so the
typical approaches our topic modeling
for example with algorithms like LD a or
k-means and in our sense what we do with
long e i-- is building those topics as
intense or meaningful semantic contexts
so that for our users they can
understand what's behind that data
interesting so let's take a little more
into the details what what does a user
bring to you what data they give you and
what do you give them back right so so
the goal of our platform is actually
that we deal with any kind of
unstructured data so our user could
upload into the platform open questions
to surveys social media data call center
data transcribed into text documents
that are ocr'd into text any kind of
unstructured text data and we've seen
many many use cases and once here blows
did the data set into the platform the
algorithm star starts working and
extracting those meaningful intends
behind the data and actually that's
something that is useful for a lot of
our clients where let's say you have all
your cousin history discovering were the
main insights in that data without
someone having to label what topics
you're looking for is very useful
because it can allow you to understand
without being biased on specific topics
but that's not like the end goal of the
platform so the end goal is
with those intense with those topics
that we identify we create language
models to analyze format text data right
so our client
let's follow on on the call center data
example a client would then send a call
into the API and it would be classified
along the topics that were identified
initially allowing them to route the
call or to be alerted as something
critical is happening whatever they they
need to do okay and the new message will
also train the system as well the
existing model yeah I mean the good
point and that's one of the benefits
when what for our supervisor yeah is
that we can run it in batch as long as
the user keeps making calls into the API
and that allows us to discover new
intense and also to augment the previous
one right so one of them one of the
benefits of that that we've seen is that
text data is very dynamic right
especially with customer service data or
customer conversations there may be new
topics because there's a crisis because
there's new ways where we express
ourselves and that's one of the
beneficial parts of unsupervised AI an
algorithm is incremental in that sense
so it can discover an augment what has
built initially okay so give me some
examples of and some data and some
intense yeah so for us an intent is we
use a broader definition of what is
usually used in in the industry where an
intent is related to a child mode right
so the intent of the user what they want
to do for us an intent is more general
it's more like a semantic context behind
the data right so we can have topic
related intents like customer service or
online banking we can have product
related intense like iPhone X or some
other specific products and we can also
have like typical intense like baby oh
right I'm speaking about the banking
example of course and the reason is that
what we're looking for is those
semantics contexts that are meaningful
and that may be useful in some way okay
so you mentioned augmenting data that's
something interesting because we've seen
when I think of my mind today I think of
images maybe you you flip them you
rotate them to get more images in text
what what is segmenting data right
that's that's a very good point so one
of the challenges that we deal with
unsupervised models on our side is that
if the if the text that the client
uploads
doesn't have a lot of information then
there may be things that we're not able
to detect right because we're not using
Hubble data were introducing
dictionaries we're not using external
information so what we do is we augment
the intent that we discover from the
client data with external data in the
internet for example right so for
example one of the things we're doing is
we're applying unsupervised model into
the Wikipedia to model with our intents
all the Wikipedia so for example if you
have an intent which is must business
master but in your data you haven't seen
for example the word degree two in order
to open that data we can use Wikipedia
were probably master on degree have like
the same context and home and the
information that we have some kind of
transfer learning yeah so it's it's
being done through with typical
embeddings Facebook has done something
with with the fast X and buildings it's
in a similar way but applying our own
our own algorithm into like external
data that's interesting and you
mentioned something about language
agnostic right so this is all these
models that you do are independent of
the language yeah exactly so as our
approach is a mathematical and based on
information theory we basically make it
in a way that it's language agnostic so
you only need the data to be tokenized
which is great because we are also able
to serve a lot of the most
underdeveloped languages one of the
things with an LP is that there's a lot
of resources for English a lot of
resources for the main languages and
there's a lot of languages in the world
right so we can deal with all the
different languages by just
loading the data into the platform on
this cover in this semantic corner so
training on English Wikipedia could help
you serve a customer and Spanish and
French and any language right or even
just with the data that the customer has
even if it's in Filipino or if it's in
bats they just upload it into a platform
we were able to discover those semantic
context automatically just out and box
that's great let's see um so let's let's
go deeper into the models let's say you
are without thinking about the scaling
yet what do you you know tell us a
little bit about the process that you do
with the with the text and and how to
cluster and things like that yeah yeah
so as I was saying we're applying an
information theory approach so the goal
is finding the semantic relations inside
the data and finding which ones of those
relations are meaningful enough in that
specific corporate right so of course
the corpora has to be represented if
enough of the problem that you're trying
to solve
if you upload one thousand tweets let's
say it may not be represented if you
know but as long as it's represented if
you know of what we do is find those
semantic context and in order to
generalize them and not having like
thousands of different contexts that may
apply in a big corpora we build a
generalization tree and based on entropy
and divergence measures we can know
which intends contain information that
is relevant enough for that specific use
case right so somehow your own data is
training the model without you having to
do anything okay and if a new completely
new language comes in how much it's the
same process because like the good thing
is that the generalization tree can also
generalize
tokens right so let's say I have
something like I know fly in business
like a business coach that could be an
intent on another one which is flying
business class right if you are have
limited session right the process of
like extracting the route in the world
and then the technology doesn't know
that flying flying are the same two
different tokens but as the context in
where they're mentioned these fly
business and flying business is gonna be
the same the generalization three is
gonna be able to say okay this is
actually the same intent even if you're
have languages specific information
right yes with tokenize data okay and
let's say well we go from the models and
we have something very pretty but I mean
I was it's hard to to get it up to big
scale what tell us more about that
process of turning your model into a
into a big scale model yeah so I mean
that the the complexities we we find in
scaling there's two of them mainly first
one is when we're doing the setup
process this application of the
unsupervised AI we receive thousands or
millions of texts so what we do is we
run the algorithm in a cluster in any
cloud provider actually be AWS school
cloud us or whatever it is we run it in
the cluster in order to discover this
intent so of course the complexities
that they're usually related to CPU but
also to memory because of we have to
create matrixes with all the embeddings
that we extract from the data so it's
like a huge matrix L hat has to be held
in memory so there's complexities in
terms of skin in the algorithm of course
and then when you're running it in real
time it's mainly having an API that
don't have like a fast response time for
clients or when they have new data they
can analyze it in real time okay how
much percentage do you think is between
what you build in-house and what you use
from technologies that are known yeah so
in our case almost 95% is proprietary
technology and the reason is that our
whole vision is
we have been focused on solving an
appeals and language problems from the
perspectives of humans so humans are
tagging data humans are labeling data or
they're building linguistic rules to
work with the data and we're trying to
change that state of the art right so
our mission is that the algorithms the
technology should be able to think as a
human in this unsupervised way and
understand the semantics right when when
I'm speaking with you you're not really
doing the syntax analysis right you're
not doing the demonstration process it's
just you're you know the semantics
behind that and you're understanding
what I say that's what we're trying to
build in our supervisor I concept so a
lot of what we do is building our own
algorithms that can apply to these
problems and that's our vision into the
future
I'm right so talk about vision into the
future I mean I think one of the things
I love about NLP is that it's still you
can see it's still in development right
you can see it you translate something
is not perfect you know and that's
exciting right how do you see the the
state of NLP for example like how far
are we from building let's say a fully
functional chat pod yeah so I mean I
think the the evolution of NLP in the
past years has been amazing so when I
when I was doing my Master's the word to
backpaper wasn't even out right and it's
been a whole revolution of how we use
embeddings run into supervisor
algorithms to reduce that dimensionality
of the data right so this is what I love
about the field of NLP and it's that
there's still a lot of innovation that
can happen in the space and that is
happening and in terms of the of the
chat board with with which of course is
one of the applications are more talked
about these days I think this I still
are of complexities to solve right so
there's chat bots that are working
pretty well in like specific industry
problems so you can build a chat board
to reply automatically to problems that
are banky user can have right annika me
paying a bill or having a problem with
his account
like it's limited to uh to a limited
amount of problems right but then when
you go a little bit more open you want
to talk about that can empathize with
the user you want to talk about that ice
able to respond to different questions
that they may have and that's where we
find the complexity of how we build that
without someone having to die an hour
later with them goes into the scaling
problem again so if for every chatbot
there has to be someone training it then
it's not gonna scale because like as
humans we can talk about anything yeah
and hopefully in the same way that we
that are a neural network and learn from
sorry for example some images of trucks
and then it helps us we're gonna
recognize birds mean hopefully maybe the
bank chatbot will be able to help you
you know have a travel for a different
domain right yeah no no of course I'm
using that direction
yeah of course on and that could apply
to two languages so part of the research
for example that we're doing in
languages is okay we apply the algorithm
in different languages but let's say a
client in Canada for example they have
French and they have English yeah so
apart from discovering those different
intents or topics they want to match
them right they want to see that
customer service in English and customer
service in France are the same so we of
course have to look at those transfer
learning approaches or those similar
applications that can be built from many
many great science or language yeah and
the same way that when you're an adult
you learn a second language but you
already know about just stuff in your
first language so you don't need to
relearn all that that's that's all
returned to be interesting yeah so um
where do you see the innovation and NLP
like do you think we should focus on
coming up with better algorithms or on
implementing them or on scaling the
simpler ones how much do you see the for
somebody who coming into an LP like what
what what do you think the future focus
is on me yeah I mean I think the for me
also has been six years in Nevada in the
on
be space and trying to think about
products and applications that can help
people clients or anyone who's trying to
build a product in that in that path I
think my my take is that as I was saying
before there's still a lot of innovation
to be made right so my advice would be
learn the basics learn the core learn
the math behind the algorithms and try
to build something that is different
because these days anyone or anyone with
like basic knowledge programming or
engineering or 'lets can apply tensor
flow to solve and a specific problem and
there's thousands of articles out there
explaining how to do it but I think our
goal and the goal of everyone should be
for this specific problem how do we
think of something different that
doesn't have to be built by Google or
Microsoft or AWS but also other people
that are innovating in the space okay so
let's go there let's say you you start a
company in NLP huh you're competing with
big big providers at Amazon IBM Google
how do you how do you enter that space
and how do you survive and compete in
that space whatever yeah that's a that's
a very good question so I mean I think
the main advice would be having some
sort of focus of course it's difficult
to compete in everything because they
have a huge research team they're
building the state-of-the-art algorithms
for us the focus is unsupervised AI and
how we apply this in a platform that
solves a very specific problem but this
can be also done in a more vertical way
so if you're building the solution that
it's gonna understand all the
conversation for example behind on a
specific vertical that's something where
you're gonna have an edge because you're
already gonna have the clients you're
gonna keep building the model that is
gonna learn
all the clients and that's not something
which is gonna be an advantage right so
my my advice would be focus focusing on
something that is going to allow you to
have a nurse and I believe that although
a lot of the research is now coming from
the big players the big players can also
change right on that's what we're trying
to do we're trying to enable the next
generation of energy products through
our supervisor yeah so we're actually
opening our platform our API so that
developers has to build products on top
of our platform that's great
yeah so let's see you know your space
you know your products you know the
algorithms in our scale it how do you
build the company how do you build a
team can you and data science team yeah
yeah no that's that's a good point so
one of the things with a start-up where
I think it's different supposed to be
company is that in terms of data science
you need to have a long term vision
right when you're researching things are
not like new algorithms new solutions
are not gonna be done in a month or in
days so you need to have that long term
vision but also thinking that in the
short term you need to have either
clients of some sort sort of financing
because someone believes in your vision
so building that data science team needs
to have done in mind how to keep the
research focus while at the same time
knowing that you need to build a product
that users or clients are using on our
benefit information and how do you like
you're doing research you're pushing the
boundaries but at the same time you need
to have a product that is working and
that's that's not easy right how do you
balance those two yeah so what we try to
do is in an organization we try to be
very horizontal so that all the teams
are working together so the data science
team back-end fronton design or UX you
know working together and the loop is
closed in a faster way
right so you
the first step in the chain of course is
the research but the first is the vision
right but you wanna build what can be
beneficial for clients then researching
along that area but always with the
focus of ok what is this gonna mean in
terms of the product and why is it gonna
be beneficial the good thing is that if
you use that feedback and those teams
communicate in an efficient and as I'm
saying horizontal way then things can be
changed pretty fast right I mean it's
difficult to build an algorithm from
scratch but then making the
modifications can be fast so if you're
getting the product feedback then you
can modify the algorithm to adapt it to
your users and that's what what we try
to do in our organization I like making
it fast to move with the product
feedback okay now something I find
interesting
artificial intelligence does one feel
that you have to have always a working
product while you do better at places
and you're moving in our plane it it's
not it's not flying until it's finished
but in here it has to work since the
very beginning yeah no totally on an
especially in the way we've built our
products and our companies it's been
mostly working with clients working with
users right I mean there's probably
wizard sinners or bigger companies that
can even have like a longer-term vision
where they're sustained by external
resources to focus on some kind of
research in our in our case it hasn't
been like that and I like it because you
have feedback from day one so you know
what's gonna work yes exactly you can
base when you use the username from the
users as a part tool and you can even
use it sometimes if you build like the
right product you can even use it to
feed it like a meta thing because you're
using the error the the feedback to keep
training your own you know company bring
the center cool so what is the perfect
data scientist that you would hire what
is what is your ideal of what are you
looking for yeah I mean in our on our
side we differentiate
between like two different kind of
profiles the senior one where we're
looking for someone that as I was saying
at the beginning kind of think outside
of the box and basically build their own
models to solve a problem so not just
applying some algorithm but building
something that is one word from our uses
because we're solving use cases that are
unique to us so we need someone that can
build that model right so it's usually
in that senior side is usually a PG or
someone that really understands those
algorithms and on the other side we also
like to have like more junior people on
the team that can actually benefit from
being in that senior team from working
with people with other enough experience
and they can start applying those
algorithms but also we can train them or
educate them on how to in the future be
able to build their own models or apply
their own models right so we have that
guidance from the senior people to feed
into the into the more you know people
okay so muslim' being able to to build
your own models and that's why we're
looking for in our specific case because
as I was saying before we're trying to
change the state of the art and like
have a different vision of like the
typical supervised models that are
applied to an LP so we like applying
that to building 10 mode which of course
you have the complexity of how you find
the object and an action in a text
without someone tagging what is it what
is an object and an action and even
without knowing what is a verb I don't
know so those are the complexities that
we encountered that probably a lot of
people done so we need to solve that
thinking with our specific mindset for
example you think if do you think of a
supervised learning is a way to do
supervised learning like a way to tag
things that's that's when my mother or I
think in itself I mean we applied
unsupervised learning in both ways so
itself it allows users to discover in a
very quick way what's behind there
but our goal is that we build the
language models behind those specific
intents so that they can classify
further data that they have so it's
really like super priced you know what
okay and that's that's how we're how
we're trying to build all our all our
contexts to solve like the full
end-to-end problem that they're
encountering okay and what's sort of
like the next thing in your radar like
what is the next thing you want to you
want to solve yeah so so the kind of
problems that we are solving our focus
as I was saying before on this
end-to-end problem right so for example
we have research on the correction side
we get a lot of noise in text especially
when it's transcribed from Kohls when
it's from social media you gotta love a
lot of orthographic errors when it's
documents and it's ocr'd a lot of errors
too so will building correction models
actually using in that case
bi-directional networks and we're
researching in that field other fields
is how we understand deeply what
someone's want to say what people want
to say in order to build a table so this
object action that I was saying before
and how in an unsupervised way we can
also build the response automatically
right without someone having to tack or
look for entities that you've written
for how can we do it on a supervised way
which is kind of a big line of research
for us another one is related to
combining different languages as I was
saying before not just being able to
make the technology language agnostic
but being able to match intense in
different languages and into the future
specific research for the complexities
you encounter with different kinds of
data so it's different if you're dealing
with a document which has like a lot of
paragraphs with information in each of
the paragraphs
whereas
when you're dealing with Twitter data
it's short data with like usually one or
two indents yeah
so adapting the technology to work
better for each of the news guys great
so we have a question from Claudio
Toledo he says as a data scientist or
machine learning engineer how much math
will we use on a daily basis in langeais
i and how does that compare to how much
intuition is used question yeah that's a
good point
so in our case math is very relevant in
order to build the algorithms because as
I was saying but not applying we're
building our own algorithm so knowing
all the math concepts that are gonna
allow you to find like the best distance
when you're measuring distance between
intents or between semantic context or
like the best way of making the
algorithm more efficient that's gonna be
that's gonna be math right but of course
there's also intuition and understanding
what the industry is the money and
that's why also we try to be very open
with communication of what is the use of
our product what our clients are
demanding so that everyone in the team
can have that intuition which we call
innovation it is one of our values in
the company and how it's not only
applying things that I decide or the
head of a new PD sides of the CDO
decides it's everyone can propose new
ways of solving problems that we
encounter along the way and how have you
developed that intuition yourself or or
people around you yes I guess yeah I
mean being being in the in the industry
for six years I've always tried to
communicate a lot with clients or
potential clients and actually with
everyone like whenever there's people I
come meet that are in the field of NLP
it's positive and beneficial for me
because they can open my mind into
different problems and I think that's
how you train that kind of intuition
getting a lot of feedback from everyone
and I'm being able to synthetize
and understand what's the next need
what's the next thing that the industry
is gonna need uh-huh and then follow up
on Claire this question aside from math
what kind of technical abilities some
should someone have oh yeah yeah I mean
I think it's knowing how to program so
in our case we use with your spy phone
so having the basics of programming is
important because we in our case the
data science team they build the models
they have to make them somehow efficient
and then there's a team that brings them
into into production but you need to
know how to program is not just thinking
in those models of course so having that
base is also important cause from the
first moment that you're building the
algorithm it's good that you think in
how to make it more efficient and the
thing is that we're startup so the more
efficient it is the less we play we pay
to AWS or of course so that's medical
and then yeah engineering knowledge and
for me it's like knowing the core of how
things work so understanding how
algorithm works how algorithms work and
not just applying them I think it's very
very important that's good yeah that we
focus on that a lot and actually I think
if it is a car like you can drive a car
by just knowing knowing how the car
works and that said but if you want to
drive the fastest car like a Formula One
or something you need to know how
everything works right so I'm guessing
it's the same thing in yeah so you think
you can I know you want to tweak your
car then you need to know how it works
for change the piece and same thing with
with these algorithms there's probably
someone that has done something similar
but you need to think okay i this
approach is nice or it's interesting how
does this apply to my problem and how
can I think of a similar approach for
these to be solved okay great so let's
say you've had a lot of experience
you've learned a lot let's say the
younger version of you comes in little
Jorge second sense and what what advice
would you give him to to get into a
space yeah I mean in in my case I guess
it's an interesting case because I just
after my master's I
I did to build the company so I mean I
think that a good way of getting into
the space so I mean the good thing of
getting into the space so young is that
I've been able to trouble I've been able
to build a company in Mexico now in the
u.s. in my early days which is which is
great I've been I've been learning a lot
product business development technology
etc so I mean my advice on on the
student side would be I mean building
upon the same constant before learn as
much as you can of how things work learn
how to think outside of the box what
people are looking for what products can
be built that sort of a problem it
doesn't have to be like a huge problem
it can be a small problem there are a
lot of people have and in that sense you
can build a very good an don't be model
and build a great company in our case
our first company was a problem with the
Spanish language we saw there there
wasn't a lot of resources for that and
we build this company where we now have
clients in five different countries a
lot of people using our technology to
better understand the Spanish language
uh-huh so actually yeah so your your
your first language is Spanish so is
mine so we both have English as a second
language and I'm wondering if you've
seen that as a challenger or as a
benefit both entering AI and entering
particular and LP which deals with
language yeah I mean I think the benefit
now on especially with education
platforms like Utah city is that the
world is global right so you can learn
AI from the biggest experts in the world
from whatever you are and you can
actually build those AI or I not BMO's
from whatever you I so what you are so I
think not some benefit from for all of
us in in
that we not believe in and I think
that's not something that we should take
advantage of right so for example
there's our team our technology team is
in Spain there's a lot of talent in
Spain it's an amazing city
and we built it there and I'm now I
moved to the US six months ago for our
ranch here in North America
it's amazing to how we can communicate
between the team without me having to be
traveling all the time right so so the
world is global now and I think that's
something that that is beneficial in
terms of AI and oh okay yeah we have
many students who live in different
places or whose language is different so
what would you say any words of advice
on on how to get into the space yeah I
mean I think that's that's a previous
question I think that's that's an
advantage in the in the sense that NLP
most of NLP resources are for English so
if you're gonna do
NLP work in your own language you're
gonna have to deal with the base
problems right you're probably gonna
have to adapt the limit icers to make it
work better you're probably gonna have
to build some resources of iran like in
the initial days we have to build like
our on sentiment ontology for example
because it wasn't a lot of resources in
spanish same can happen in a lot of
languages so that's a benefit in the
sense that it's gonna help you learn all
of the NLP problems and how actually you
build them from scratch and I think
that's beneficial because it's it's good
to know as I was saying before how
things are built there and then you can
apply with sources that are out there
you need to build your own but it's it's
good to have to be open-minded on how
different languages and I not become the
applied into
in languages yeah yeah and when it comes
to learning things like do you have a a
particular way of learning something new
because AI is always about learning more
right like we don't really not build yet
so we have to constantly learn that what
is your way of learning yeah that's uh
that's a good point too so I mean in my
sense it's not only AI right cuz I have
to learn about product development
technology so there's there's a lot of
topics and what I do is I try to follow
the leaders in the industry in terms of
technology I try to follow the newest
recent research papers and try to read
them try to understand them try to know
where things are going even if I don't
dedicate the time to build the models
myself and that's actually something
that we also do in the team so we do
these sessions where someone in the team
finds an interesting paper and they
presented to the rest of the team so
that the butanol understand why it's
interesting I think having that in mind
being able to be in the forefront of
research from all organizations from all
researchers in the world I think it's
important yeah and having fun right yeah
yeah it's totally like like we have new
fields like fat chicken right it's it's
become where we all know it's gonna be
an important problem ten years ago we
didn't have this it's a new NLP program
that has come along the way and people
are trying to build solutions to that
it's exciting that all of us are
learning at the same time writing is not
there's not some teachers and learners
actually feel like I'm learning as well
there's a follow-up question from cloudy
again do you worry about the ethical
implications of AI like the consequences
of mistakes and biases in your data and
algorithms yeah no totally we worry
about that and not usually a problem
that we've seen with images right
were it can be biased to some race or
something a specific problems that can
happen in the case of text it can be
similar in a way if you have models that
are a black box right that's actually
why we believe and that what we're doing
with this unsupervised AI can be useful
so the technology extracts the intense
and you can you have a name for the
intense you can click on them you can
see what is behind what a specific
intent and you can understand what's the
data that is that is running you can you
can get a feeling of that right whereas
maybe sometimes were you using on your
network maybe you don't know what's
happening don't you which can be which
can be problematic and I think it's
something that the industry as a whole
has to pay attention on how to make
models less of a black box more so that
we can also tweak them to to make them
like less biased now and this is not
just as you say it's not just the data
but also the model right like I feel
like I used to work in recommender
systems and I think I couldn't get away
of recommending things to myself like I
was just thinking of how to do it you
know the user was always a version of me
and I think in that way diversity as you
mentioned is very it's very important
right yeah Savion and it's us to what I
was talking before if in the terms of
NLP if someone is gonna be training the
model and labeling data it's gonna be
bias to their criteria so let's say in a
typical example of sentiment analysis
okay I'm loving some later let's say I'm
a negative person very biased into
negative right and this could happen
into any kind of personalities or the
person I'll take behind them the NLP is
gonna be the users personality I stand
in that data that's what we're trying to
avoid yeah
how much do you think we just have to
become less biased people and how much
you think we have to get better models
like anything is a trade yeah probably
probably it's both
yeah probably a model if you used
different like a representative set of
people tagging data a model should be
able to overcome by us hopefully but can
we do that and I think specifically can
we know when the algorithm is biased I
think that's the important thing
- like realizes if you don't even notice
thank you you're supplying the algorithm
it's like solving some problem and it
may be bias to some races races problem
or gender equality problem because you
didn't think of that
I'm the represented absolutely
absolutely definitely yeah
so yeah like you as ask me as many
people most people watching with we
didn't start in nai right we started
somewhere else and so there's no major
yet in AI in terms of your journey like
what was there was there a moment where
you thought a pivotal moment that you're
like okay I'm I mean this thing yeah so
I think that's most of the students when
I was younger I didn't have any idea of
what I wanted to do so when I was
choosing my degree I was between physics
math Electrical Engineering kind of
everything related to I mean I knew I
wanted to do some science major so yeah
I mean there was one professor
specifically that showed me that
electrical engineer and could combine
many different fields like electrical on
computer could combine many different
fields and then I could decide which was
beneficial for me and then when I was in
Chicago there was this professor
professor argument in the Illinois
Institute of Technology in Chicago that
he actually recommended that I went into
the field of NLP to do my thesis and I
think it was a great great step in in my
career because like of course it wasn't
as big as it is now
and I think that's that's important
having some kind of guidance having some
kind of senior people that can guide you
through the process or where you gonna
worry when you're gonna go into AI
because they have the experience and
maybe they have the vision that at the
moment where you're starting in AI you
may not have right now after you work
some years
be that person but at the beginning you
need some guidance
okay so who has been influential people
that you can that you have looked up to
yeah no I think I mean fermions in the
in terms of that research and those two
professors I mentioned have been
influential to me I guess when I think
of it too I ended in the linguistic or
NLP space and my mother is a Spanish
teacher so so she understands our
somehow focuses on understanding
linguistics right which is interesting
and my father is a scientist totally
different space but I guess I kind of
maybe looking up into then I have tried
to combine those two fields into an LP
just one of the things I love about NLP
like you get to combine that linguistic
way of thinking where you need to know
about language you need to know about
humanities you need to know like
emotions around people but also you have
this algorithm and a I focus machine
learning focused approach with the
technical side yeah it certainly
combines that because language really
captures a lot of human emotions and a
lot of what we really are right and so I
think it's the one of the biggest
challenges that we face is to on that
talk about the face to how to how to
make them more human and are we gonna be
able to do that are we gonna be
we'll make a chart but somehow empathize
with with the user and understanding
what the user is really feeling the
problem that he has caused for example
in a customer service center or for
complaint management a user can be angry
and if you're not really carrying the
feel of that as a good customer service
agent would do you can encounter that
problem right so that's where emotions
are psychology are also very very
important into an RP yeah
are there other fields in AI that you
think can also can also capture what
what we are feels that you're interested
in yeah no I mean I think I think most
of the fields in AI what they're trying
to do is solve a problem that someone
was doing before a more human way right
so you can be looking at an image or you
can be looking at text and you are gonna
understand what that image is about what
text is about or automating other kind
of processes so I think that that
happens in in in the whole AI industry
and it's one of the of the challenges
are some industry to like how do we make
this is AI more human right yeah I guess
veronik you know humans have language
but we also see we also like it
combining all these things yeah how do
we yeah like yeah when we see something
also on an image of someone we can also
understand if he sad maybe capture his
emotion yeah it's a lot of research in
that field - of how do we really
understand their emotion I actually was
seeing this this example of the other
day this example of real-time emotions
in Mark Zuckerberg and that's
interesting how we can really understand
what he's thinking because also yeah
every personality can be different a
poker face you can see yeah but maybe
their computer has seen enough but who
can tell what your face or something
else company are effective if you work
for a computer vision and a degree and
they they used to do that like they
would analyze like human emotion faces
and things like that yeah that's the one
I saw well yeah so our question from
Chris actually what unique challenges is
natural processing natural image
processing compared to other fields like
computer vision I mean I think one of
the unique problems of NLP is how is
parse the data is usually and how many
features you can feed into the algorithm
right so initially of course typical
initial NLP papers for example in
sentiment analysis they would use a bag
of words model right and the challenge
is that can you feed all of the words
into the model and there's a lot of
features so of course it can be a
sparsity problem along the way we work
with the melling's to reduce that kind
of dimensionality and somehow put
together things that are similar and
feed that into into supervised
algorithms and I think that's the the
main challenge in language that we may
not find in other problems how we find
the right features and the right
features that are relevant which is were
like mainly all of the problems focus on
that right leg right how do you find the
stop words for a certain problem how do
you find things that are synonyms how do
you find things that are related how
your limit is data in order to to like
reduce the dimensionality and our that's
I think that the beauty of language the
variety of it
and that's only in one language we go
into all of the languages and maybe one
thing doesn't translate
sadly into another language - in
translation you're gonna find that
problem it's not direct translation it's
a different expression well things like
humor things like a person I are
different in different language have you
tried translating a joke to a different
language and seeing that it's not funny
at all exactly that's probably a
challenge yes well in yeah it's hardest
right so so that's that's I think the
beauty of language and the beauty of
having so many languages in in the world
is that we have to deal with that
diversity yep another question do you
find applications for traditional
symbolic air techniques a part of the
models and systems you build form our
NLP applications or in other words how
much of his is traditionally I
techniques and how much is it is like
deep learning approaches etc yeah no
that's what I was saying before that I
think understanding the core the core of
algorithms and the math behind it is
very important because a lot of the
people are playing deep learning and
building these complex neural networks
to solve NLP problems but those neural
networks are really internal flow anyone
can do it right so I think that's very
important that kind of different way of
thinking were everything you've learned
before that applies to different
algorithms you can apply it to a certain
problem that you're encountering and
this is specifically what we're doing
like we're using information theory
we're using entropy measures we're using
the variance and kind of information
gained behind the data that we thought
we deal with that something that has
been there it's not new yeah I think
that's a that's a great thing about
research and about thinking differently
deep learning can solve a lot of
problems it's amazing amazing
breakthroughs same with meanings the
media's product very few but like let's
think of other research fields or
research vision that can be us as a
breakthrough as water back on
now deep learning yep great yeah and I'm
guessing it's also likely not as a
learning process right like just how you
would tell yourself years ago to learn
math basic math and computer science
like right now I would tell you know
people to say well learn don't just
learn deep learning that's very
important but also learn all the
traditional algorithms and how they work
yeah I remember when I was when I was
studying these these specific topics
about specifically how to make
algorithms more efficient or even how to
build your own shell I remember I had to
do this project experiment of how to
build your own shell
it was very relevant for me because I
could understand how it works
in a computer and how actually we can
build that stuff in terms of engineering
and same in terms of like how the
algorithms work and why using a tree can
be more efficient than using another
algorithm and maybe there's one approach
that could solve a problem but it may
take days production system it may not
work for you so having that in mind
especially in a start-up like ours if
that's very important because the
resources are limited
yeah many times we have a lot of data
the simplest algorithm not only is the
one that works really well but also the
only one that you can actually run on
that data it's actually when I moved to
industry that was that big thing I
thought is gonna be like all cutting
edge stuff and it's like no actually the
simplest one is the one that that does
the best yeah I think it's what I was
saying before is finding the right
amount of innovation together with
knowing that you're building a product
that users need to be working on right
so it cannot be something that goes into
ten years Chris probably in ten years
things have changed so much that is not
even right yeah let's take the last
question from the students what is an
example of NLP performing a risk and
security assessment great so yeah I mean
when you're when you're doing
we actually have this it's our
circumference right now and in San
Francisco so it's an interesting it's an
interesting interesting point I think a
field that is that is very relevant into
the into the future so for example when
companies are doing a risk assessment or
security assessment there's a lot of
documentation that they need to look at
and there's private information there's
risk of privacy problems there's risk of
security if you have like let's say
banking data or whatever it is so in
terms of NLP it will be kind of finding
those patterns in data without having to
tag them right because you can look for
specific words you can model them with
rules but how if you have a huge amount
of data did you find the group that
there are specific problems specific
topics so that they're easy to tell and
easy to build a model yeah definitely
great so let's uh let's think about more
about our students because our students
are representative of us right there's
there's variety and location gender
nationality age what knowledge you come
in and and that's one thing that's
fascinating FAI right like that
everybody comes from a different walk of
life so in your experience you come from
a walk of life you have any any words of
encouragement you'd like to give our
students about about yeah I mean I think
the good thing of of AI as we've been
saying is that you can apply your own
experience into the field whereas it's
in a vertical specific like pumpkin you
can from the financial industry you've
got a law no first a lot of
inefficiencies and problems of the
financial industry that can be solved by
AI and there you have an advantage
because like now most of the people that
haven't worked in finance maybe don't
know the specifics for that and saying
if you come from the engineering or
you have a different background as
opposed to AI or like a product
background you're gonna have a different
mindset on how to solve those problems
so I think and that's also what we try
when we build our team and thinking on
the team like the Masters specific
people that are working on the team and
even our clients when we work with
clients like some of the feedback they
give us on some of the use cases with
our structure data that we find we could
solve we may not be able to come up with
them without them telling us because
there's day to day problems that they
face so for example when when speaking
with our clients we found that it would
be very useful to apply our technology
in to employee feedback so for big
companies employees can give a lot of
feedback but it's challenging on how
like to find patterns on problems that
you have in the organization so it's a
use case that we haven't thought of
before but it could be interesting
application of our technology and opens
up a whole new vertical which is HR
right so the more you know about
different things your original maybe
your original background was HR you can
apply it yeah to to this case and I
think that's that's the point like also
if you're especially if you're trying to
build a new product or you're trying to
get into the industry it's combining the
knowledge that you already have your
advantage against the rest of the people
which is knowledge and then the
specifics of what you've learned in AI
and how they can solve that problem you
know maybe a lot of people don't know
great yeah any final words you want to
say to our students no I mean I think
we're in a great era in a great moment
in terms of AI and innovation there's
like everything that is happening in AI
a lot of what's happening AI has happen
in the last year's but I think there's
still a lot of innovation to happen so
to anyone out there I would say
don't think that everything is gonna be
built by Amazon by Google by Microsoft
actors like there's people out there
that have the intuition have the
innovation background that can lead them
to fun to create to build the next
Amazon right so so I wouldn't say like
the aperture says that you're gonna
start a company but he's gonna trust you
I believe that that may not happen so
that you can build a company with that
with the focus even if it's deep tech
even if it if it has a lot of research
and maybe build the next Amazon or build
something that a lot of users can
benefit from and can use your technology
to solve a real a real life problem
great yeah and I want to reiterate on
Horus statement I think think get
efficient intelligence is something that
we're all learning we're all still
building you know it's not it's not done
and it's it's hard to know many things
and it's we feel ignorant I mean I think
I think everybody feels in right
including including the experts and I
think that's a good feeling like I think
if you feel ignorant it means you're
learning more and as long as you're
learning more and enjoying you you are
part of our part of this of this
revolution you know yeah sorry it's keep
you learning yeah and that's that's the
way we all exactly well i'ma tell you
that yes thank you very much whorehouses
thank you pleasure to have you here and
yeah well thank you all for for joining
us today and see you in the next
fireside chat yeah plus or what Martin
was mine thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
