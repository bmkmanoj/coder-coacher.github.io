power of our rewrite rules to help us
complete the parsing chart we've already
seen two possible ways to do it if the
dot is right before a non-terminal then
we take the closure or predict what's
going to happen by bringing in rewriting
rules that start with a see if on the
other hand the dot is right before
terminal a token a fixed part of the
input we shift over it just move our
finger to the right assuming that this
new token c is exactly what we see in
the input but there is a third case a
corner case three corners that's hard to
draw actually that's not hard to draw
something with three corners is a
triangle in which there's nothing after
the dot what if there's no c and there's
no d and we've reached the end we've
done a lot of shifting and our fingers
already as far to the right as it can go
well now we're going to reduce by
applying the rule x goes to a be in
reverse for example let's say that the
input was a B blah and we were right
here we'd seen these two characters and
one of the rules in our grammar was X
goes to a be I match up this a with this
one this a with this one and I'm going
to take my input and conceptually change
it removing the a B and replacing them
with X as if I'm constructing the parse
tree or applying the rewrite rules in
reverse we've seen before how one
direction corresponds to string
generation and one direction corresponds
to parsing so once we've matched our
predictions exactly if the input has
correspondent 2a and the input is
correspondent to be and we have a
rewrite rule X goes to a B we're going
to apply that rewrite rule in Reverse to
do parsing removing a and B from the
input conceptually and replacing them
with X this is called reduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
