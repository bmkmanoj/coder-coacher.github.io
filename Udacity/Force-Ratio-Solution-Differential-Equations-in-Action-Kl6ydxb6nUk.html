shrinks and it does so by a factor of
two let's see in detail why this has to
be the case the trick is to add an
imaginary sphere of half the radius and
then we can look at the force from the
car part and the force from the shell
and this is where the name shell theorem
comes from the car part is again a
sphere s is the complete object so we
can compare what's going to happen as we
go from the large sphere to the small
sphere distance is x 1 half as we go
down that hole the mass is multiplied by
1 over 8 as we're shrinking the original
sphere to half of its radius we're
shrinking the volume 2 18 and hence the
mass to one-eighth of the original value
if we take these two together the
original force will be x 1 over 8
because the mass appears in the
numerator divided by one-half squared
because the distance squared appears in
the denominator and in total this is a
factor of one-half and to see what's
happening with a force from the shell
let's put an imaginary sphere close to
the inside of that she'll if there is a
gravitational force on the surface of
that sphere it has to be rotationally
symmetric for instance like that can
this be no where would the water be
flowing we would have to drain that
water somewhere which we don't can the
force point to the outside know where
would that water come from in the first
place so the only reasonable value for
the magnitude of the force is 0 and
hence in total the force goes down to
one half of its original value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
