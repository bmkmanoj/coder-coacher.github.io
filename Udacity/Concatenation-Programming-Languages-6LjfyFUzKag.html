character regular expressions let's look
into gluing them together we're going to
need to find important bits of
punctuation like slash greater than or
equals equals to reason about javascript
in HTML and thus write our web browser
thus we really need the ability to
concatenate or put right next to each
other and repeat regular expressions
well with regular expressions that's
actually as simple as just writing to
regular expressions next to each other
this matches the string a1 a2 b1 b2 c1
and c2 6 strings in all in each one the
first letter comes from the first
regular expression and the second letter
one or two matches the second part of
the regular expression we've
concatenated a through C and one through
2 together to match more complicated
strings you may have noticed that we
suddenly had quite a few strings from a
relatively small regular expression in
fact if we put 0 through 9 next to 0
through 9 there are a huge number of
strings that we would match a hundred in
total just as this matches 10 in this
matches 10 when you put them together
you match 10 squared strings so let's
look for a two-digit number in the
string July 28 1821 here's a two-digit
number here's a two-digit number and
here's another one so we'll end up
getting 28 18 and 21 now I'm looking for
two-digit numbers in 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 is a
two-digit number 3 4 is a two-digit
number but 5 actually does not qualify
this regular expression requires that
both of its sub parts be matched on July
28th 1821 is a good day for Peruvian
independence let's brush up on matching
these compound regular expressions down
here I've written a Python fragment a
Python program involving re dot find all
we're looking for a through Z followed
by 0 through 9 in this artificially
constructed string designed to be a bit
tricky a 1 space to be spaced cc3 space
for 4d I'm going to write out a bunch of
possible answers and I want you to tell
me check all that apply which of the
following are elements of the return
value of this
here I've written nine possibilities
check each one that's a member of the
list that's returned by this Python
expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
