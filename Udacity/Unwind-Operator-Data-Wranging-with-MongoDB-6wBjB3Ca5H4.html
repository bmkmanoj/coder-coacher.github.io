talk about the unwind aggregation
operator in a lot of situations we're
going to want to count or do some other
sort of operation based on the values in
an array field we need to use array
field values in some way so with this
data we might want to answer a question
like the following in our collection who
included the most user mentions in their
tweets now the reason why this is
relevant to the unwind operator is
because user mentions are included in
our tweets inside an array field now in
this city if you remember user mentions
are found within the entities sub
document in particular in the user
mentions field user mentions is an array
that contains documents that represent
each individual user mentioned so what
I'm going to do here is pull up some
examples using this query now here I'm
using an operator that we haven't seen
before all this says is give me back
documents where the user mentions field
of the entities sub document are of
length 3
so I'll pretty print this then if we
scroll up we can see that this example
here does in fact have 3 user mentions
in it and just so you have the full
picture entities is a top-level field
here it has a sub document as a value
and user mentions is one of the fields
of that entities sub document user
mentions is an array valued field and we
can see that it holds documents that are
shaped like this now what we're
interested in are these screen names
here because these are the names of
users that are mentioned in this
particular tweet and for any tweet that
mentions a user are going to have an
array with documents like this inside of
it naming the users mentioned now what
we want to find out is account of all
the user mentions made by an individual
Twitter user so what we're going to have
to do is look through all of the tweets
there'll be some grouping involved of
course because we want to group together
tweets by the same user but we also want
to count the number of user mentions
unwind is a convenient tool for doing
that to answer this particular question
let's take a look okay so here's our
aggregation pipeline our first stage
uses the unwind
operator and it's being run against that
user mentions field now remember that
what unwind does is creates a copy of
the containing document for any array
field that duplicates all fields except
for the items in the array and it will
create one copy for each element in the
array and the only difference between
all of the copies will be that this
field will take on each of the different
values in the array in the documents
that are produced so let me let me make
this a little bit more concrete if we
take a look at this again for this
particular tweet the unwind stage will
produce three documents as output for
this one tweet document here all of the
other fields that we see here all of
these and everything else here in this
tweet document will be exactly the same
the one difference will be that the user
mentions field will have a single
document as its value in each of those
three copies of this tweet in the first
copy it will have this as its value in
the second copy it will have this and
finally the third copy it will have this
so in the documents that get passed
along to the next stage in this case a
group stage the documents will have a
different value for the user mentions
field now it turns out that in our case
what we really care about is this
splitting effect not so much what the
value of user mentions is each time
through because what we're interested in
doing in the next stage is essentially
counting all of the documents that pass
through to this group stage with the
same screen name for the user who
created the tweet because again remember
the question we're after here is who
included the most user mentions in their
tweets so by the time we get to this
stage unwind will have produced an
individual document for every user
mention in the collection and group then
we'll aggregate them together based on
the screen name of the user who created
the tweet will then simply produce a
count field here as part of our group
operator
and again remember that some simply
increments this counter each time he
sees a document that's aggregated
together with a screen name or a
document that has the same screen name
then we do our sort and limit stages so
one question I'll put to you here is
does this count the number of unique
user mentions that is to say if a
Twitter user mentions the same user more
than once does this count each one of
those mentions or does it count all
mentions of the same user as one mention
if it is not unique mentions that are
being counted here the question I'll
leave you with is what type of
aggregation pipeline would we need to
put together in order to count unique
mentions of users okay so let's run this
and because we limited this to one we
get one document in our result array
with a count of 21 for user mentions for
this user now in case it's not clear to
you by this point the advantage of the
aggregation framework in MongoDB is that
all of this work is being performed
server-side that means that for this
particular query all that comes across
the network to our client it's just that
one result we just looked at the
aggregation framework is powerful not
just because of the functionality it
provides but because of the speed with
which it can execute these queries
because this functionality is
fundamental to the server itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
