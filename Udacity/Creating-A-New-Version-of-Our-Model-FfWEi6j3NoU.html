and delete the photo frame entity so the
model is as it was before
now we must create a new version of our
model add model version you can call it
however you want model to seems
reasonable and it's based on our current
now you can see that we have two
different model versions however the
previous one is still marked as the the
current one
we need to change that to change the
current version of your model select
your model and then in the file
inspector look for model version and
current should be a model too
so now we have our new version mark as
the current one
we should make all the changes back to
this new version so let's go ahead and
add the photo frame entity back
the last step is to make a minor change
in our core data stack to make sure that
it does the migration from version 12
version 2 we do this by adding two
simple options to the persistence
coordinator
let's get it done we create a dictionary
of options and one is NS migrate
persistent store automatically option
which is pretty obvious what it's doing
and we're setting it to true we want to
migrate and we're also telling the
persistent store to infer the mapping
model so we're telling you find out how
well you should migrate from version 12
version 2 and we simply pass these
options when we add a store coordinated
and that's it
now it's your turn grab your Xcode and
create a new version of your model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
