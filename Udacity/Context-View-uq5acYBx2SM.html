modeling recall omt the object modeling
technique and it had both structural
view and behavioral view but it had a
functional view and the functional view
made use of what are called data flow
diagrams UML does not contain that
particular functional view it uses use
case diagrams instead but I wanted to
show you the data flow diagrams because
I have found them personally useful in
describing describing systems in
particular a data flow diagram conveys
systems activities and the ordering in
which they occur data flow diagrams can
be nested and the outermost data data
flow diagram is called a context diagram
in the context diagram there's a single
oval which denotes the system as a whole
that oval can be connected to various
external actors in the case of the
context view those aren't stick figures
instead they're rectangles and the
actors can be individual users or they
even can be external systems which are
communicating with a system that you're
modeling the lines that connect the
actors to the system are called data
flow lines that is there's some
communication of data between the actor
and the system or the system and the
actor here's a context diagram of a
system that plays chess the external
actor is the human opponent and there
are three flows of data a human opponent
can submit moves to the to the chess
playing program similarly the chess
playing program can communicate moves
back to the human opponent or the chess
playing program can produce a diagram of
the current board situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
