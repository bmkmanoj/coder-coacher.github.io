inter-domain routing or routing between
a SS recall that internet routing
consists of routing between tens of
thousands of independently operated
networks or autonomous systems each of
these networks operate on their own
self-interest and have independent
economic and performance objectives and
yet they must cooperate to provide
global connectivity so that when you're
sitting at home you can retrieve content
that might be hosted at the Georgia Tech
network now each independently operated
network is called an autonomous system
or a s and ejs advertises reach ability
to some destination by sending what are
called route advertisements or
announcements the protocol that a s is
used to exchange these route
advertisements is called the border
gateway protocol or simply BGP a route
advertisement has many important
attributes but for now let's just talk
about three now a router here let's say
in the Comcast network might receive a
route advertisement typically from its
neighboring AAS that route advertisement
might contain a destination prefix such
as the IP prefix for Georgia Tech then
it might contain what's called a next
hop IP address which is the IP address
of the router that Comcast router must
send traffic to to send traffic along
that route typically that next hop IP
address is the IP address for the first
router in the neighboring network and
Comcast's router knows how to reach that
next hop IP address because it's border
router and the border router and the
neighboring AAS are on the same subnet
typically this might be a slash 30
subnet therefore this IP address is
reachable from comcast border a third
important attribute is what's called the
AAS path which is a sequence of what are
called AAS numbers that describe the
route to the destination now strictly
speaking the AAS path is nothing more
than the sequence of a SS that the route
traversed to reach the recipient a s so
for example Georgia Tech's a s number is
26 37 and Abilene's is one zero five
seven eight so the a s path that Comcast
would hear if it received a route
advertisement from Abilene for Georgia
Tech
b10 5 7 8 followed by 2 6 3 7 so the
remainder of the lesson we'll look at
other BGP route attributes but these are
essentially the three most important
because they describe how to stitch
together an inter domain path to a
global destination so we have the
destination IP prefix for the
destination that a router might want to
send traffic to the next hop which is
the IP address for the router for the
next hop along the path and finally the
AAS path which is the sequence of a SS
that the route traversed and route to
the AAS that's hearing the announcement
the last AAS number on the AAS path is
often called the origin a s because that
is the a s that originated the
advertisement for this IP prefix in this
case the origin a s is 26:37 or Georgia
Tech because it is the a s that
originated the announcement for this
prefix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
