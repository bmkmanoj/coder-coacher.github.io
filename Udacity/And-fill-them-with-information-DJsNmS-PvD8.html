know luckily we have this content
provider that has the exact data we need
let's put these things together but wait
we took all this effort in sunshine to
not run queries on the main thread async
tasks 10 services loaders and sync
adapters we're all used what can we do
here or is there even a problem let's go
back to when we added our app with your
provider to the manifest the app with
your provider class is actually a thin
wrapper around one of the basic types of
components on Android a
broadcastreceiver broadcast receiver is
a short-lived component that receives
broadcasts from other components or
other apps through its on received
method app widget provider parses the
broadcast sent by the android system and
provides us with a simpler to use on
update method among other things turns
out the the on receive method and hence
our on update method get called on the
UI thread doing anything that might take
a while it's probably not a good idea a
very common pattern when you need to do
more work in response to a broadcast is
the broadcast receiver starting an
intentservice to do the heavy lifting
intense services are great for this kind
of work because the on handle intent
runs on a background thread and the
services automatically stopped when it's
done no need to keep a service around
when there's nothing to do so will write
an intense service that does everything
are on update method did and change are
on update to call start service now we
can use the same technique we use
elsewhere to retrieve data from our
controvery query to retrieve our data
and then extract the information we need
so now we can see our app with your
provider is calling our intent service
around 10 services and querying for the
data and getting response back as our
app widget provider is a broadcast
receiver at its core our sync adapter
can send a data change broadcast to our
app with your provider to update the
widgets exactly when we have new data
will add a new constant to our sync
adapter then use that
instant as the action for the broadcast
we send out then we'll update our
manifest entry for the app widget
provider to receive the new action
finally to actually handle our message
we override the on receive method to
look for our action and start the
intense service to update the widgets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
