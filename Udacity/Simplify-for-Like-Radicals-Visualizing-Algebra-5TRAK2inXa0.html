adding like radicals together and in a
couple of the cases we couldn't even
combine the radicals because the
radicands were different sometimes
radicals will appear to be different but
they're actually like we can simplify
these radicals to determine whether or
not we can add or subtract them together
for example we can split up the square
root of 20 and 24 x 5 then we can split
this radical up into two separate
radicals using our product rule we do
the same thing for 80 and for 500 notice
that when I split up a TI split it up
into the largest perfect square and the
same is true for five hundred a hundred
is the largest perfect square that goes
into 500 this allows me to simplify the
radicals more quickly now that we have
some perfect squares we can simplify
them the square root of 4 equals to the
square root of 16 equals 4 and the
square root of 100 equals 10 we multiply
the remaining factors in front of our
radical to get 16 root 5 12 root 5 and
negative 20 root 5 notice how we were
able to simplify each of these radicals
two radicals that I'll have a square
root of 5 because these radicals are
identical we can add and subtract them
will have 16 plus 12-20 which equals
eight times the square root of 5 this is
why we learn how to simplify radicals
first because even though these radicals
don't appear to be like we can simplify
them and then combine them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
