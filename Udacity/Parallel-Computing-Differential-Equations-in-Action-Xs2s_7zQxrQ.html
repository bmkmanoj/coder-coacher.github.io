on in the implementation of a solver is
whether or not to use parallel computing
there is a range of ways for doing so
and all of these can be combined with
each other we have vector units on the
CPU which is units that can operate on
vectors apply the same operation to say
for different values at the same time
multi-core CPUs allowed to do several
very complex things at the same time the
same is true for multiprocessor systems
GPUs graphics ships are optimized for
working with huge array of pixels but
they can work with everything else as
well which means of course they are also
good at working with matrices it's
rather difficult to speed absorbers for
ordinary differential equations the
solver does one step at a time and every
following steps depend on the steps
before how could you do some of these in
parallel that does not seem to work well
speeding up a differential equation
solver for ordinary differential
equations with help of parallel
computing may work for instance in a
situation where you have lots of
isolated entities which rarely influence
each other such as the planets orbiting
the Sun as you have seen in unit 6 it's
of vital importance to speed up servers
for partial differential equations and
in this case parallel computing really
comes to help one option for this is to
use spatial subdivision each processor
of a multi-core system can handle its
own spatial domain treating the borders
between the different domains right
requires communication this can become
an expensive overhead we look into that
in the next quiz when we apply finite
elements or work with implicit solvers
for partial differential equations we
often find huge matrices they are an
ideal workload for GPUs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
