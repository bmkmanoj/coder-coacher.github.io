customize grades behavior so now let's
look at how build variants allow you to
control the behavior of your app itself
and depending on which app we're
building the Android Gradle plugin
creates a whole slew of source sets and
depending on which variant you're
building it will merge the sources and
resources from those sources into the
final apk at the most broad level
there's the main source set which is
located in source main this is where
we've been putting all of our code so
far additionally there's a source set
for each product flavor assuming our
example from before let's say we have a
free and a paid product flavor there's
also a source set for each build type in
this case debug and release
finally there's also a source for each
final variant
so that's source free debug free release
paid debug and paid release if we have
sources and resources that we need in a
paid flavor but not in the free flavor
we can put them in source paid similarly
if there are resources we need for the
debug build but not for the release
build we can put them in source debug
finally if we have resources that are
needed only for the paid debug variant
then we can put them in source paid
debug when we build a particular variant
Gradle will take care of merging all the
sources and resources we need for that
variant it will also take care of
overriding resources that are defined in
more than one configuration the rule is
that the more specific configurations
override the less specific
configurations Java source files cannot
be overridden so you need to be careful
that you don't try to define the same
class definition and it ends up in
multiple variants Gradle can do a bit
better for resource files like strings
dot XML or even Android manifests for
resources of that type the files will be
merged and the entries will be
overridden by ID to determine what
sources and resources are included when
we build a particular variant we can
draw a diagram that looks like this
we start in the middle if we want to
build the paid debug variant Gradle will
include everything in main then merge
everything in paid overwriting any
conflicts next Gradle will emerge in
everything from debug overriding again
then finally Gradle will merge in the
resources and source that are in paid
debug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
