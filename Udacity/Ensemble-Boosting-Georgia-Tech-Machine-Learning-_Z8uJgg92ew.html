two questions we were trying to answer
and so far we've answered the first one
learn over a subset of data to find a
rule by choosing that subset uniformly
randomly and applying some learning
algorithm and we answer the second
question which is how do you combine all
of those rules of thumbs by saying you
simply average them and that gave us
bagging so Michael I'm going to suggest
an alternative to at least the first one
and leave open the second one for a
moment that's going to get us to what
we're supposed to be talking about today
which is boosting so let me throw an
idea at you and you tell me if you think
it's a good one so rather than choosing
uniformly randomly over the data we
should try to take advantage of what we
are learning as we go along and instead
of focusing just kind of randomly we
should pick the examples that we are not
good at so what do I mean that by that
what I mean by that is we should pick a
subset based upon whether the examples
in that subset are hard so what do you
think of that well I guess it depends on
how we think about hard right so it
could be that it's hard because it's
some in some absolute sense right or it
could be that it's hard relative to you
know if we were to stop now how well
would we do yeah and I mean the latter
oh okay all right well that I feel like
that makes a lot of sense I mean
certainly when I'm you know trying to
learn a new skill I'll spend most of my
energy on the stuff that I cut that I'm
kind of at the edge of being able to do
not the stuff that I've already mastered
it can be a little dispiriting but it
but it I think I make faster progress
that way right and if you go back to the
example that we started out with with
spam right if you come up with a rule
and you see it does a very good job on
some of the data some of the mail
examples but doesn't do a good job on
the other why would you spend your time
trying to come up with more rules that
do well on the email messages you
already know how to classify you should
be focusing on the ones that you don't
know how to classify and that's the
basic idea here between the basic idea
here behind boosting and behind finding
the hardest examples cool okay so that
answers the first one we're going to
look at the hardest examples and I'm
going to define four
you exactly what that means I'm going to
have to introduce at least one technical
definition but I want to make certain
you got that and the second one the
combining well that's a difficult and
sort of complicated thing but at a high
level I can explain it pretty easily by
saying we're still going to stick with
the mean okay
or voting except this time this time
we're going to do weighted mean now why
we want to do weighted mean well I have
to tell you exactly how we're going to
weight it but the basic idea is to avoid
the sort of situations that we came
across when we looked at the data before
we're taking an average over a bunch of
points that are spread out just gives
you an average or a constant that
doesn't give you a lot of information
about the space so we're going to weight
it by something and it's going to turn
out the way we choose to weight it will
be very important but just keep in your
head for now that we're going to try to
do some kind of weighted average some
kind of weighted voting okay
sure one of the things that's scaring me
at the moment though is this like I have
this fear that by focusing on the
hardest questions and then and then sort
of mastering those what's to keep the
learner from starting to kind of lose
track of the ones that it already has
mastered like why does it not thrash
back and forth so that's going to be the
trick behind the particular way that we
do weighting so I will show you that in
a moment and it's going to require two
slightly technical definitions that
we've been kind of skirting around this
whole conversation okay sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
