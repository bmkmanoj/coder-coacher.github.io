problem through a different problem
suppose I want to multiply a sparse
matrix a times a vector X remember the
duality between matrices and graphs
meaning this sparse matrix has this
equivalent graph representation the rows
and corresponding columns of the matrix
are vertices and the non-zeros are edges
one way to do a distributed
breadth-first search is to use a
computational primitive that looks like
this linear algebra operation now
suppose you decide to distribute the
work by first dividing the matrix row
wise you would then assign block rows to
processes note that this assignment
corresponds to a partitioning of the
graph this example is a vertex based or
just vertex partition observe that this
partitioning usually also implies a
partitioning of the vectors x and y
that's because there's a one-to-one
mapping of vector entries to graph
vertices now the amount of work in a
sparse matrix vector multiply is
proportional to the number of non-zeros
so when you divide up the rows you might
want to do so in a way that balances the
number of matrix non zeros per partition
so that's one goal now you have another
goal in choosing a partition hmm what is
that goal recall that the vertex X is
partitioned now suppose you want to
update the first block of Y because of
these non zeros you're going to need
these corresponding elements of X that
requires communication with the
processes that own these elements of X
in the language of graphs these
communication exchanges happen any time
an edge crosses a process boundary for
instance these two non zeros correspond
to this edge the two processes that own
the endpoints of the edge will need to
communicate this observation suggests a
second goal to minimize communication
volume you prefer to reduce the number
of edge cuts this example motivates the
classic graph partitioning problem
you're given a graph and a target number
of partitions as input your goal is to
divide the vertices into say P
partitions you'd like this partitioning
to have the following properties first
these partitions should cover all the
vertices but should be disjoint the
partition should also be about equal
sighs and the number of cut edges should
be minimized that is the graph
partitioning problem in a nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
