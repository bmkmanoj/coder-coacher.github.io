helping determining situations that may
be stressful it's important to note that
we can also experience many small
hassles throughout the day immaculately
to stress so the accumulation of minor
irritations such as waking up late for
work getting stuck in traffic doing
poorly on a test or even your
significant other not calling you back
all those things can add up and the
result is stress however it's important
to note that what you may find stressful
I may not therefore stress is what we
call an individual response the
important thing to remember here is that
it's the person's perceived ability to
meet the demands of the situation that
determine whether or not it's stressful
for example what you may find stressful
I may not now this scale is useful but
it doesn't tell us everything about
every type of stressful situation in
addition there are some items that are a
bit outdated for example one item says
wife begins or stops working nothing
about a husband working or a partner
working just a wife now this leads us to
the second way to look at stress and
that is stress as a response when we say
that everybody handles stress
differently we're talking about how does
that person handle stress both
psychologically as well as
physiologically now we're going to go to
Lauren and look at the psychological
vantage point of how people handle
stress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
