how do it's doing quite well thank you
for asking
sure how's it going on your end of the
world I'm feeling okay let's say though
I'm a little concerned because last time
we we were talking and you said you had
a question and I promised that I would
get into it and it's uh it's complicated
but it's really interesting
so let's um let's remind ourselves what
the question was so we're talking about
bounding the number of samples that we
need to learn i've classifier or concept
in some given hypothesis space H and we
ended up driving a formula that looks
like this so the formula tells us that
we're okay as long as the number of
samples is at least as large as one over
the error parameter epsilon times the
quantity log of the number of hypotheses
plus the log of one over the failure
parameter and and so if the we want to
make sure that we succeed with very low
failure probability this Delta is very
small and that makes means we need more
samples and if we want to make sure that
this error is really small that also
makes this quantity big which means we
need more samples right so you remember
this I do remember this all right and
what was your concern well my concern
was that the number of samples depended
upon the size of the hypothesis space
and I was wondering what happened if you
have a really really large hypothesis
space like for example one of the
infinite size or infinite cardinality I
suppose the right term all right well
