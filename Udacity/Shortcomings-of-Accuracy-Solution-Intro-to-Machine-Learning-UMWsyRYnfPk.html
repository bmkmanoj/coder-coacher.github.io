concerns that you should have when
you're thinking about the metric that
you should pick and they do all happen
to be problems with accuracy in the in
the case of identifying persons of
interest so accuracy can give you a
problem when you have skewed classes
because the denominator of this formula
all the items in this class ends up
being a very small number which means
that the accuracy that you compute as a
result is something that you might not
be sort of as trustworthy of as if you
have lots and lots of examples of
instances of that class also the second
two options are going to be things you
want to think about that you want to
pick a metric that's really tailored to
the operation that you're trying to do
and that as a result you might want to
maximize the chance that you err on the
side of guessing that someone's innocent
or that conversely you err on the side
of flagging them as a person of interest
even if it means that you catch more
innocent people sort of in your net as a
result accuracy is not particularly
well-suited to either of these outcomes
but there are some evaluation metrics
that are and that'll be what we talk
about in this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
