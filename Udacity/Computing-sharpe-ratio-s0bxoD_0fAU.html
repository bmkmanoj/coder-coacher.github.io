Sharpe ratio as proposed by William
Sharpe himself it's the expected value
of the return on the portfolio minus the
risk-free rate of return
divided by the standard deviation of
that same difference
this is the ex-ante formulation meaning
you know because we're using expected
it's a forward-looking
measure of what the Sharpe ratio should
be now to calculate this in reality we
need to look back at those values so for
instance the expected value of this
difference is just simply the mean of
what that difference was over time so to
calculate this in Python using
historical data we just take the mean of
daily returns - the daily risk-free rate
and divide that by the standard
deviation of the daily returns - the
daily risk-free rate now you may be
wondering what is this risk-free rate
where can we get it traditionally there
are a few numbers that people use for
this one is LIBOR or the London
interbank offer rate another is the
interest rate on the three-month
Treasury bill and finally a value that
people have been using a lot over the
last few years is zero zero is a good
approximation to the risk-free rate now
I've been presenting this as if this
risk-free rate changes each day and
indeed LIBOR changes each day and three
month t bell changes a little bit each
day but there's a shortcut people use a
lot that simplifies this equation
significantly and this shortcut makes
sense because usually the risk-free rate
is not given on a daily basis for for
instance putting your money in a bank
account or a certificate of deposit
usually that's a percentage on an annual
basis or a six-month basis so you can
convert that annual amount into a daily
amount using this simple trick let's
suppose our risk-free rate is 10% per
year or 0.1
that means if we start at the beginning
of the year with a value of 1.0 at the
end of the year we have 1.1 so we add 1
here so this is the total value of our
asset at the end of the year now what is
the interest rate per day that would
enable us to get to this value it's a
number that if we multiply it by itself
each day for each day in the trading
year or 252 times would arrive at this
number so here's how we do it we take
the 250 second root of that sum believe
it or not that's pretty easy to do in
Python actually and subtract 1 and that
is our daily risk-free rate we are in
most cases in this class just going to
approximate the daily risk-free rate
with zero because that's what it's been
for such a long time of course it may be
changing in the future so keep this
shortcut in mind now suppose we want to
use this value which is fine we would
plug that in here and also plug it in
here so observe that if we plug a
constant in here in this standard
deviation calculation we can just remove
it because a set of values minus a
constant when you calculate the standard
deviation is just as if this were zero
summing it all up this is the equation
we typically use for calculating Sharpe
ratio using daily returns we drop the
daily risk-free rate from the standard
deviation because we treat that as a
constant if our daily risk-free rate is
greater than zero then you need to plug
it in here but we can usually use a
constant there as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
