right now they're probably going to be a
lot of steps involved in simplifying
this expression so let's just get
started the first thing I'm going to do
is use the distributive property to
distribute multiplication of negative 3x
to every term inside the parentheses
remember that it doesn't matter how many
terms are inside the parentheses we
still multiply every single one of them
so for now that's the only thing that
I'm going to change I'm going to leave
everything else all the other terms in
the expression exactly as they are so
now we have this long expanded
expression I'm really sorry I had to
erase your challenge warning sign but
know that I still think this is a
challenge problem now we'll simplify it
within each term you notice that I
haven't switched any of these operators
signs to minus signs yet so I'll do that
in this next step so wherever i'm adding
a negative term i'm actually just
subtracting that term so instead of plus
negative 3x why I actually just have
minus 3xy and now finally we get to
rearrange your terms so that like terms
are next to each other and simplify and
so here is our final answer we still
have six terms which just goes to show
you sometimes you can't do anything more
to make an expression look any prettier
but it definitely is a bit less
complicated than it was at the beginning
I know this is a really tough problem
and again there were many many
opportunities for little mistakes to be
made so if you got even part of this
rate especially perhaps than the
distributive property that is awesome so
if you made a little mistake go back and
try it again the distributive property
will keep popping up at different places
throughout the course so it's super
important that you really really
understand it although probably not all
the problems we do will be quite as
complicated as this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
