way of doing things but maybe that's
good enough we need to look at how we're
actually using this procedure if we're
gonna use it for a human to tell how
many days old they are in an interactive
way the fact that we have to wait three
hundredths of a second for the answer
doesn't matter that's plenty fast enough
getting that down to less than one
hundredth of a second is not worth extra
effort if we're using it in a service
that's doing this computation lots and
lots of times for lots and lots of
different dates well then maybe it's not
fast enough and it's worth putting time
and effort into doing something better
but we shouldn't put that time in an
effort until we know that we need it to
be faster this point is important enough
that I want to put it in our guide to
solving all problems so we have our
first steps don't panic
make sure we understand the inputs and
the outputs work through some examples
by hand to think about how we would
solve the problem systematically and
then try to develop a simple mechanical
solution and the key here is simplicity
the simpler it is the more likely we're
going to be able to program it correctly
eventually we might need to worry about
making it faster but let's not worry
about that until we have to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
