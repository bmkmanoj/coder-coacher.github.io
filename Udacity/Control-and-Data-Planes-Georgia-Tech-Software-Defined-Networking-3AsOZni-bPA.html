between the control plane and the data
plane the control plane is the logic
that controls forwarding behavior
examples of control plane functions
include routing protocols as well as
logic for configuring network
middleboxes
now a routing protocol might compute
shortest paths over a topology but
ultimately the results of such
computations must be installed in
switches that actually do the forwarding
the forming table entries themselves and
specifically the actions associated with
forwarding traffic according to the
control plane logic is what constitutes
the data plane so examples of data plane
function include forwarding packets at
the IP layer and doing things like
switching at layer two so to reiterate
routing protocol functions that compute
the paths our control plane functions
whereas the act of actually taking a
packet on an input port and forwarding
it to an output port is a data plane
function so why is separating the data
in control planes a good idea the first
reason is independent evolution and
development thus software control of the
network can evolve independently of the
network hardware the second reason that
separating data and control planes is a
good idea is the opportunity to control
the network behavior from a high level
software program controlling the network
from a high level program in theory
allows network operators to debug and
check network behavior more easily than
in the status quo where network behavior
is determined by the distributed low
level configuration across hundreds of
switches and routers the separation of
data and control provides opportunities
for better network management in data
centers by facilitating such Network
tasks as virtual machine migration to
adapt to fluctuating Network demands in
routing the separation of data and
control provides more control over
decision logic in enterprise networks
Sdn provides the ability to write
security
applications such as applications that
manage network access control in
research networks the separation of data
and control effectively allows us to
virtualize the network so that research
networks and experimental protocols can
coexist with production networks on the
same underlying network hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
