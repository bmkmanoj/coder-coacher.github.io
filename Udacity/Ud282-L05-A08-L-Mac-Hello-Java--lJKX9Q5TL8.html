version of the JDK installed let's write
a simple program like I mentioned before
you can use any text editor and I'll be
using TextEdit which can be found again
in your Applications folder or just by
searching for it and I'll click on this
to open a new text edit document and to
get the correct format the first thing I
need to do is make sure I have the
simplest plain text settings so I'll
click on text edit and preferences and
in this window I want to make sure I
have two specific settings the first is
that I want my format to be plain text
instead of rich text the second is that
I want to make sure that I uncheck this
box for smart quotes by choosing plain
text and no smart quotes and making sure
that this text won't have any special
characters for example smart quotes will
create special left leaning and right
leaning quotes that our Java compiler
won't be able to understand it can only
understand the normal straight up and
down quote character so now that we have
these two settings plain text and no
smart quotes let's open a new document
by clicking file new so here's our new
plain text document and it looks a
little simpler already here I've written
a simple hello world program that
contains the code that will print out
the string hello world and I'll provide
this code in the notes so that you can
copy and paste this into your own text
document and you don't have to write it
all yourself the first thing I have is a
comment which is text that won't be
executed and in Java single line
comments start with this double slash
then you see the words public class
hello world and the class in Java is
just a way to contain functions in code
and refer to our program and this class
is called hello world with a capital H
and a capital W all one word then inside
these curly braces is a main function it
says public static void main and this
main function is where a computer will
go to read and actually execute code and
we'll learn more about both classes and
this main function later so don't worry
if you don't understand all this right
now just know that the
inside our main function will be
executed by our computer when we run our
hello world program and inside our main
function
there's this print code which should
look familiar it's a print one statement
that prints out hello world and notice
that these quotes are just to straight
up and down lines they're not tilted one
way or the other now to compile and
actually run this code we first have to
save this text as a Java file it's
important that our file have the same
name as our class HelloWorld all one
word with a capital H in capital W in
this dot Java extension let's our
computer note that this is a Java file
and I'm just gonna save this on my
desktop so it's easy to find then click
Save and there's our Java file on our
desktop then to compile and run this
code we have to go back to our terminal
window and if you've closed it don't
worry just open it up again by searching
for it or going through your
applications and opening it now I need
to tell my computer to find my Java file
and I need to navigate to the directory
that I've saved it in since I've saved
it on my desktop I'm gonna say CD
desktop and press enter and CD just
means change directory so now we're in
the right spot the next thing we need to
do is to compile our code and to do that
we type in the name of our compiler Java
C then a space in the name of our
program HelloWorld dot Java and press
Enter
if this compilation step is successful
our terminal will just move to another
line if you get any errors at this step
it's most likely because your format is
not in plain text or accidentally
include smart quotes or maybe your file
name doesn't match your class name so if
you get an error check on those
potential sources and once our code
compiles successfully our last step is
to execute our code we do this by typing
in Java to let our computer know that
this is a Java program and then the name
of our compiled program which is just
hello world and press ENTER and we
should see the expected print output
right below hello world and we can run
this code multiple times just by typing
Java how
world but if we want to change anything
like what prints out we have to go back
to our text file and change our code so
let's go back and change our print line
so that it prints out hello Java instead
of hello world so I'm just gonna change
this word to Java and then save it then
let's go back to our terminal window and
try running our program again but wait a
second it still printed out hello world
and that's because even for small
changes like changing the print output
in our Java file the whole file has to
be compiled again before it will reflect
the changes so we have to compile again
by typing Java C HelloWorld dot Java and
you may have actually noticed this hello
world class file here and this is
actually the code that our compiler
creates it takes our Java file and turns
it into a dot class file so now we've
compiled our most recent code let's run
it again by saying Java HelloWorld and
enter and this time it reflects our
change and says hello Java so you can
see that writing code in a text editor
and then compiling and running it
separately in the terminal can get kind
of tedious especially when you want to
change anything in the code and to make
it easier to organize and write code
will be downloading an integrated
development environment also known as an
IDE
development environments often include
Java compilers so this will make it
easier to write and run our code in the
same application there are a number of
environments that help programmers code
in Java and we'll be using one called
IntelliJ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
