customers in a physical channel but
what's really interesting is most
startups kind of forget that it's much
more expensive to get a customer than it
is to keep one yet
we seem to go from order to order or
user to user forgetting about thinking
about overtime is how can we extract
more dollars or usage or whatever is
important to us from our existing
customers how we do that is the first
thing we need to do is make sure our
existing customers we've just gotten
don't go away and so if you're in
business long enough you start thinking
about how to keep customers some
examples well the airlines are the
perfect examples of keeping customers
they run something called the loyalty
programs they give you points they give
you rewards etc for staying with their
airline credit card companies boy they
love to keep you using their credit
cards because you know what it's just a
piece of plastic and they're loaning
your money anybody could do that but
they want your business full-time so
they'll make up programs and you know
things that make you think about oh it
would be terrible to leave this credit
card to this airline because I lose all
the points that's a great example of a
loyalty program or product updates
here's a way to keep me loyal is instead
of just this one-time purchase I'm
getting these updates your newsletters
or something useful through the lifetime
of the product and smart companies not
only do loyalty and product updates
sometimes just send me newsletters and
here's what's going on and here's
whatever and how can we help you at
cetera
even though on day one you're not
thinking about keeping customers because
you're desperately worried about getting
them just understand the next thing
you're gonna be doing is worrying about
how to keep your most valuable customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
