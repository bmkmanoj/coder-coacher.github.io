uncertainty and there's an opponent it's
called game theory if there's no and
opponent it's usually called decision
under uncertainty there's other names so
let's look at an example of that first
before we get back to the game of pig
here's the decision I'm going to give
you you're on a game show
and you won and you get a prize of 1
million dollars or euros or whatever
currency you want to use and now you're
given a decision you can keep the 1
million dollars or the host will flip a
coin and you believe it to be a fair
coin and if the if you call it correctly
you get 3 million but if you get it
wrong you get nothing
and so you analyze the outcome of this
and you believe that this is a choice
by the coin that has a 50% probability
of each outcome and you want to say what
should I do
should I keep the million where should I
go for the 3 million so what I'm going
to do is code up a model for this and
then let the decision Theory decide
first I just define a variable million
because it's hard to see the number of
zeros and count correctly now
traditionally utility is used with the
abbreviation u and quality with
abbreviation Q so I'm going to define
here a quality function that says given
a state and an action what's my and
given a utility what it what a state is
worth to me that's going to tell me the
value of that state action pair and the
actions available to me are holding and
gambling let's go ahead and make that
explicit so in any state the actions
available are holding and gambling we're
really only gonna deal with one state
but we make this perfectly general and
the state that I start with is however
many dollars I have in my pocket could
be anything
and given that state if I hold my state
is going to be increased by 1 million
dollars and then there's some utility on
that how much do I value having what I
have now plus 1 million and if i gamble
there's a 50% chance that I get 3
million more than I have now and there's
some utility for that and a 50% chance
that I get nothing more than I have now
and some utility for that so that
describes the quality of the state
but only describes it if I have a
utility function I have to know how much
do I like money well simplest choice for
a utility function is the identity
function say the the identity function
just takes any input X and returns X
it's it's the input itself and so we
could say the event if I start with
nothing the value of the state of having
nothing is zero and the value of the
state of having a million is a million
and now here's the amazing thing is that
I can just write out what the optimal
strategy is what the best action is for
this state and what it's going to be is
the maximum over all the possible
actions from the state that was just
told and gambol maximized by EU which
stands for expected utility expected
meaning average so what's the average
utility of each of the actions and I've
defined the average utility as the
quality of that state given that s that
state action pair under the utility
function and that means that the q had
to deal with the averaging and it did
that it said 50% this 50% that that's
the value of gambling
now this best action function solves
this particular problem but the amazing
thing is is that we can completely
generalize this so if we just add in
parameters now we're saying what's the
best action in a particular state if you
tell me what the available actions are
what the quality of each state action
pair is and what the utility is over
States then I can tell you what the best
action is and that works for any
possible domain that you can define it's
amazing thing that we've solved all the
problems at once similarly to the way in
search where we had won best search
algorithm that could solve all the
search problems now it doesn't mean that
we're done and we never have to program
anything again because programming it
can be difficult there's some problems
that don't fit into this type of
formulation and there are many many
problems which you can describe but what
you can't solve in a feasible amount of
time so we haven't solved everything but
it is amazing how much we can do with
just this one short function let's go
ahead and solve it let's solve this
problem and let's say I start off with
a hundred dollars what's my best action
well when I run that tells me the best
action is gamble now that doesn't sound
quite right to me if you were faced with
that problem and assuming you had $100
to your name would you take the gamble
try to go for the 3 million or would you
hold with 1 million and there's no right
or wrong answer to this despite what the
interface has to do it has to tell you
one answer is right or wrong but you
should ignore that I just want to
collect some data on how many people
think that they would gamble in that
situation and how many people think they
would hold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
