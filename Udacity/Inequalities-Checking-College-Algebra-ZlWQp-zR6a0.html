inequalities have ranges of values that
are solutions to them so that means that
if a number falls in this range we can
use it in the inequality to make a true
statement some of these may be a bit
confusing though for example 3 is less
than or equal to 7 on a number line if
we're curious about all the numbers that
are less than or equal to 7 we would
shade in all the numbers to the left of
7 on the number line and then draw a
square bracket to include 7 in that
range we can see that three definitely
falls in this region it is not equal to
7 but it is less than 7 and it only used
to fit one of the criteria implied by
this symbol it either needs to be less
than 7 or it needs to be equal to 7
similarly the statement 8 is greater
than or equal to 1 plus 7 is also true
when simplified this of course gives us
the inequality 8 is greater than or
equal to 8 and you might at first think
oh my gosh eight is not greater than
eight however it only needs to be
greater than or equal to 8 it's equal to
8 so that's enough to satisfy this
inequality we can see the difference
here then between this symbol the
greater than or equal to which implies
inclusion of 8 verses the just greater
than sign this statement is true whereas
this statement is not because 8 is
greater than 1 plus 7 only allows for
the greater than criterion not the equal
to 1 1 plus 7 no longer fits the bill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
