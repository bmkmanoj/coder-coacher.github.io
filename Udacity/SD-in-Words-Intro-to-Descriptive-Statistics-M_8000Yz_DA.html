this first one we take the square root
of the average squared deviation well
the deviation is X I minus X bar the
squared deviation is then just X I minus
x-bar squared and the average is summing
each squared deviation up and then
dividing by n and this is our formula
for standard deviation the average
squared deviation is basically this
inside the square root sign but then
instead of taking the square root we
square it this is not the standard
deviation the sum of squared deviations
well these are the squared deviations so
the sum is just this remember that this
is also called sum of squares sum of
absolute deviation squared the absolute
deviation is X I minus X bar with the
absolute values and if we square them
that's the same as if we didn't take the
absolute value and then if we take the
sum we get the sum of squares again so
these two are equivalent and they're not
the standard deviation finally we have
the sum of squared deviations divided by
n and then the square root of that so
that is also our formula for standard
deviation good job I know this was
really hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
