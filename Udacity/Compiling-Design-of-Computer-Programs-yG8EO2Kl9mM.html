interpreter works for regular
expressions we have patterns like a or b
plus which define languages language is
a set of strings like a bee a bee B a
and so on defined by that pattern and
then we have interpreters like match set
which in this case takes Saturn and a
text and returns a list of strings or
set of strings and so we say that mat
set is an interpreter because it takes a
description of the language namely a
pattern as a data structure and operates
over that pattern here's the definition
of mat set you see it looks at the
pattern breaks out its components and
then the first thing it does is this big
case statement to figure out what type
of operator we have and to do the
appropriate thing so there's an inherent
in efficiency here in that the pattern
is defined once and it's always the same
pattern over a long string of text and
maybe over many possible texts we want
to apply the same pattern too many texts
and yet every time we get to that
pattern we're doing this same process of
trying to figure out what operator we
have when in fact we should already know
that because the pattern is static is
constant so this is kind of repeated
work we're doing this over and over
again for no good reason but there's
another kind of interpreter called a
compiler which does that work all at
once at the very first time when the
pattern is defined we do the work of
figuring out which part of the patterns
are which so we don't have to repeat
that every time we apply the pattern to
a text so we're a interpreter takes say
a pattern and a text and operates on
those a compiler has two steps in the
first step there is a compilation
function which takes just the pattern
and returns a compiled object which will
call c and then there's the execution of
that compiled object where we take c and
we apply that to the text to get the
result
here work can be done repeatedly every
time we have a text here the work is
split up some of it is done in the
compilation stage to get this compiled
object and then the rest of it is done
every time we get a new text let's see
how that works here's the definition of
the interpreter let's focus just on this
line here so this says if the op is a
literal then we return this result and
the way I'm going to change this
interpreter into a compiler is I'm going
to take the individual statements like
this that we're in the interpreter and
I'm going to throw them into various
parts of a compiler and each of those
parts is going to live in the
constructor for the individual type of
pattern so we have a constructor literal
takes a string as input and let's return
a tuple that just represents what we
have and then the interpreter deals with
that now we're going to have literal act
as a compiler so what it's going to do
is return a function that's going to do
the work so what is it saying we have
the exact same expression here as we had
before but what we're saying is that as
soon as we construct a literal rather
than having that return a tuple what
it's returning is a function which is a
function from the text to the result
that match set would have given us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
