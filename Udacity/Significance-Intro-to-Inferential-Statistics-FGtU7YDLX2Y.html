value for an alpha level of 0 point 0 0
1 so a z-score of 3.14 occurs out here
somewhere in the green region so this is
significant at probability less than 0
point 0 0 1 2.07 is between one point
six five and two point three two so that
z-score occurs somewhere in this red
region so it's significant at p less
than point zero five hopefully this is
making sense let's do the last two 2.57
will occur somewhere in this blue region
because that z-score is in between two
point three two and three point zero
eight so the probability of getting this
c score is 0 point 0 1 and finally this
is a really huge z-score so this sample
mean occurs somewhere way out here far
from the mean but we don't
conventionally have an alpha level that
is that small so we'll just say that the
probability of getting that sample mean
is less than 0 point 0 0 1 good job so
just to recap if our sample mean falls
in the critical region for an alpha
level of point zero five it's unlikely
and therefore probably didn't occur by
chance something's going on and there
are different levels that help us decide
how sure we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
