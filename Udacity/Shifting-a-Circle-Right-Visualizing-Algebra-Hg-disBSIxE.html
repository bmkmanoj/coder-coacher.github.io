with the center at 0-0 and we moved its
center to 20-0 we also moved the other
four main points so we can connect them
to form a new circle that's been shifted
20 units to the right but what I'm
wondering is what's the equation that
would represent this circle we know we
can't use this equation since it
represents the circle centered at the
origin we also know that this equation
can't be right for a new circle since if
we plug in the point seventy comma 0
into the equation it doesn't check the x
value is too large keep in mind at this
point was at 50 comma 0 and the y value
still was zero but the x value changed
to 70 which made this too big and it
made our equation not check so what I
want you to think about is what would be
the equation for our new circle centered
at the point 20 commas ero I want you to
enter that equation here now I want to
acknowledge that this is a really tough
question you want to think about if the
radius changed at all or if the X values
changed or the Y values change we need
to adjust one of them which one do you
think we should adjust and by how much
take some time to think about it and if
you'd like you can always play around on
decimals and enter your own equations to
see how circles move you're not expected
to get everything right on your first
try you're just expected to think and
learn about math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
