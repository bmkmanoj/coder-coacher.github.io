combining operators and assignment let's
create a variable called total payroll
and set it equal to zero let's also
create some other variables to hold the
salaries of three hypothetical players
on say an athletics team one way we can
calculate the total payroll with
salaries is to do this which isn't too
bad it all fits on one line but in
certain cases we may only want to add
one salary at a time and if we were to
do this then our calculations would
change to say something like this in
this case we add one salary at a time to
the existing value of the total payroll
so this isn't too bad if we want to add
them one at a time but we can do better
than this by combining assignment and
the plus operator all at the same time
and we can do this by using the operator
we want in this case the addition
operator followed by an equal sign and
while this may be confusing at first
let's look at how the operator reads
from left to right first we want to add
to our existing value and then we want
to assign and we can also do this with
other operators like subtraction
multiplication division and the modulus
operator so I'm going to fix this up and
now we get the same value by combining
the addition and assignment for this
addition assignment operator if you want
to see this with a different operator we
can change all these signs to
subtraction signs and now our total
payroll is negative 2,500,000 and this
would be more appropriate if we wanted
to show the deficit after paying our
players as opposed to the total payroll
that we saw earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
