complete the mapper function first we
create an array data which splits each
row of data on the comma if the length
of the data array is not equal to 12
which is what we expect given our odd
hard data or the first entry is equal to
registrar which would indicate that this
is the header row we continue on to the
next row otherwise we print the district
and the number of odd heart generated
separated by a tab now let's talk about
the reducer function recall that our
reducer function will consume the key
value pairs emitted by our mapper so we
create an array data for every single
line which will essentially be of length
2 containing the key and the value
note that we split on the tab which we
input into the output of our mapper if
for some reason data is less than or
greater than length 2 we continue on
there's something wrong with this key
value pair and we shouldn't process it
next we set this key and count equal to
the key and number of odd hard generated
in data recall that reducer receives the
key value pairs sorted by key so if this
is a new key let's submit the final key
value pair the key and the total number
of Aadhaar generated separated by a tab
then let's set odd hard generated equal
to 0 otherwise let's add the number of
odd hard generated in this particular
key value pair so the total number of
Aadhaar generated for this key and let's
continue on to the next value we include
this last if Clause for the last key in
our data because there's no next key
after the last key if we didn't have
this we would not admit a key value pair
for the final key in our intermediate
data so here after we've done all this
other processing up here we just say for
the last key hey let's make sure that we
omit the key value pair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
