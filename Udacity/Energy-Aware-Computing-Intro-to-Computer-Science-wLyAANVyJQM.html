student at Berkeley in the lab where she
works on energy or we're computing so
tell us about this here okay so I'm
working on a project in which we try to
create electrical Oates's power
consumption can be scheduled at a given
point of time in order to make use of
renewable supplies of energy like wind
and solar which are only available when
there's wind or Sun and not available
when we necessarily need them to be and
so on this project we tried to create a
computing cluster in which we scheduled
the work that the cluster did at times
when there is wind energy available so
for instance the types of work this
cluster might be doing is you might have
some set of these machines which act as
web front-ends in respond to search
queries and they would need to respond
to search queries as soon as the query
came in and you wouldn't be able to
schedule this work any other time but
some of the other stuff that the
computing cluster might be doing is
building the index for the search engine
and that sort of work has some
flexibility and when you actually can do
it so you can wait until there's wind
energy available to schedule this work
and so you can so these machines can do
their work powered off of wind energy
and the rest of the time you can keep
them in a low-power state so they're not
consuming energy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
