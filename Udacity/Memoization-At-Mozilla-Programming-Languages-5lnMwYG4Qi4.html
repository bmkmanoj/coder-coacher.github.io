this course is memoization or caching
writing down values that we've already
computed so that we can be lazy and not
have to recompute them later we've used
this as one implementation of parsing
but in the real world it might come up
in many other places Brendan if you had
a chance to use it at Mozilla or in your
other projects not so much in parsing
because we are in a tight competitive
regime with other browsers and you have
to parse very efficiently it looks very
efficiently but in you know sort of
building a browser you end up memorizing
or caching a lot you end up trying to
remember decisions you made that were
expensive that can be preserved under
some some rules and reused we also have
a memory management system that's quite
complex we have a garbage collector for
JavaScript we have a reference counting
system for our c++ code the two have to
meet that it's possible form cycles
which then have to be collected we use
an old David bacon dynamic programming
trick bacon and restaurant on pldi 2001
I think it's a cycle collector for
reference kind of objects and it buffers
pointers that its aspects of forming
cycles and a pointer in a reference kind
of graphic informant cycle ever the
reference count is going down from above
to to above to wonder above so that you
may still have a stuck reference there
do a circle and so we use these
techniques we can strain a little bit
and using C++ that has to run on windows
mac and linux but you know in Python and
JavaScript people memorize all the time
and there's a crazed now for prepares
parser expression cleaners I think
that's that printer I all mix it up with
something else but it's a parsing
technique that's can use memoization
when it's bath/reading
and ordered choice so we're familiar
with this and we try to use memoization
to go too fast we at Mozilla we have
less use in parsing more more run time
