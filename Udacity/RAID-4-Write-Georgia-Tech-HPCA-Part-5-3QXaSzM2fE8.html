for rights let's say we have rate four
with five discs here and let's look at
just one set of stripes with their
parity and now let's say that we want to
write new content to the zero so of
course here we will have changed the
data and the remaining data discs don't
have any changes to their data but the
question is how do we compute the new
parity one way of doing that would be to
read the data from the other three discs
and XOR that with the new content for
the fourth disc but that would result in
three reads and the right if n is even
larger that would increase the number of
reads we need to do the right so instead
we are going to figure out how to update
this parity what we need to know is what
was the old data and a new data if we
XOR these we get which bits of the data
have changed if we know the old parity
and this x sort change and we XOR the
two together we get to flip all the bits
of the old parity that would change as a
result of the bits so basically a flip
in the data here will result in a flip
in the parity here we have computed what
to flip
exhorting it with the operative flips it
and that's what we write to the new
parity so that's why we have a read and
the write of the old parity in addition
we have a read of the old data if we
don't already know it and we know the
new data so basically we have a read
from the data disc a read from the
parity disk a right to the data disc and
a right to the parity disk and the
parity disk will be a bottleneck because
the four disks here are accessed by
writes in a way that reads and writes
one disk another right would maybe read
and write this this but all of these
read and write the parity disk so it
becomes a bottleneck and because the
parity disk is a bottleneck for writes
we have raid 5 which has exactly the
same reliability properties rate for
and very similar rate performance but it
fixes the right performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
