that the state charts are quite powerful
there's lots to them like the class
diagrams you don't have to necessarily
use all those features in every diagram
that you do how in fact do these state
charts relate to the class model
diagrams well the way to think about it
is that each of the classes in the class
model diagram has attributes and those
attributes form a state space but each
of the classes in the state diagram
could have its own state chart now that
doesn't mean you're going to be building
state charts for each of the classes
because most of the classes have
relatively simple states and are
perfectly well described by the methods
manipulating the attributes of that
class in the state charts there's
references to attributes those are the
attributes of the class there's also
references to actions and activities and
those are the methods of the class the
events in the state chart diagrams are
going to correspond to signals a signal
is a dependency in the class model
diagram you can use a stereotype in this
case the stereotype is send to indicate
that the move movement agent class is
going to send a signal called the
collision signal there's a dependency
between those two two classes so what
this is saying is that as you're doing
your state chart modeling you have to
make sure that it's consistent with
respect to the class model diagram that
is the events have to be named the
attribute names have to be correct the
method names have to be correct and so
