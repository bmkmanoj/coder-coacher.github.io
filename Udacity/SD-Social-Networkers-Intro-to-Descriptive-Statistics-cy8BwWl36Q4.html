by doing it in a spreadsheet you could
do all of these calculations without any
technology and if you did that that's
really great it's always really good
practice to calculate things without
using any technology but just for the
purposes of figuring out the standard
deviation technology can really speed
along this process so I'm not going to
use any shortcuts here I'm going to do
it exactly as we would if we didn't have
technology so first we need to take the
average of all of these so we're going
to sum them up
so we're taking the sum of all of these
I could also just write equals a1 plus
a2 plus a3 all the way to a 10 and we
get the same thing but why would we do
that if we can simply write this now to
take the average all we do is divide by
the number of values which is 10 so
that's just going to be 50 1500 11.1
alternatively the nice thing about
technology is we can just do this take
the sum and divide by the total number
do it all in one step so now we have the
average now we're going to subtract the
average from each one of these values
not the opposite where we subtract each
of these values from the mean that's an
important distinction in this case it
doesn't matter as much but in other
statistical concepts that's an important
distinction to make so we'll write
equals a1 minus the mean so we're
subtracting the mean from each of these
values now it could just do the same
thing here and write equals a 2 minus
the mean but that would be tedious we
can just drag this down when you do that
remember that there has to be a little
plus sign there that means you're
successfully dragging it down if you
went like this it won't do anything
it'll just highlight the boxes
so here we have the deviations from the
mean here in the next column we're going
to square each deviation equals v1
square and again we're going to drag it
down so we have the squared deviations
for each of these values now remember
that the variance is the average squared
deviation so we could just write average
of c 1 to c 10 but i want to make sure
we go through all the other steps in
between so let's again practice
calculating the average just for
clarity's sake so the variance then
would be the sum of c 1 to c 10 remember
that's how you start out taking the
average and then divide by 10 so here's
the variance and then the standard
deviation is simply the square root of
the variance so we'll write equals s qrt
that's the shortcut for square root and
then we can just say c-13 so we know
that the standard deviation is 6550 7.16
approximately now I want to point out
something really important before we
finish this solution video here I simply
set equal square root of this cell C 13
whereas here I wrote out the whole
average the reason for that is because
say I had put the cell here a 13 then
when we drag it down we don't get the
right deviations and we can double click
on it and see what it did here it took a
four- a 16 whereas here it took a 1
minus a 13 which is what we wanted but
we want it to always stay a 13 which is
why we have to make sure this is a
constant and the way to make sure it's a
constant is by just writing it
notice also that all of these values
changed when these values changed
because all these values are dependent
on these values so when we change it
back we should again get the correct
standard deviation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
