these metrics session count session
length and retention can really affect
monetization in games first let's
consider a straightforward example of a
game that uses ads to make money now as
might not make the most money which
we'll get into later but their success
does depend on how often and how long
users play your game because each time
and added displayed in the game it makes
a small amount of money for the
developer and when there are a lot of
sessions so the session count is high
there will be a lot of opportunities to
display an ad similarly when a session
is long ads might be displayed multiple
times in one session so both of these
result in more ads being displayed and
more ads mean more money and retention
looks at these effects over a longer
period of time say your app launches and
people are excited about it there's a
lot of sessions but then after a week or
so people start to get bored with it and
the number of players and sessions drops
over time and when the number of
sessions drop so does the amount of
money the game makes so high retention
is important for monetization because
your game will only make money over time
if you retain a steady number of players
retention is especially important if
your game is planning on selling items
in the game over time these items are
called in-app purchases and include
things like power ups or a special game
equipment that players can buy and then
use in the game and you want these sales
to be pretty consistent over time so
that you continue to make money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
