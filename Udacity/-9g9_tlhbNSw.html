how does the term data analysis relate
to similar terms like data science data
engineering or big data first data
science is very similar to data analysis
in fact many people might describe some
of the examples I gave near the
beginning of the lesson such as Netflix
is movie recommendations as data science
I often hear people use the terms data
analysis and data science
interchangeably however to the extent
that there is a difference in my
experience data science is a little more
likely to refer to building some sort of
the system like a recommendation system
or a ranking algorithm while a blog post
or a paper is more likely to be referred
to as data analysis it's definitely a
fuzzy line though if you hear some
advice for a data scientist it's
probably relevant for a data analyst as
well in terms of job postings a data
scientist title sometimes requires more
experience than the data analysts title
although of course this varies by
company data engineers are more focused
on the data wrangling step of the data
analysis process they make data
pipelines and ensure that data
collection is fault tolerant and scales
well they're more involved in storing
and processing data and less involved in
drawing conclusions based on the data
big data is a fuzzy term that refers to
the fact that many companies today are
dealing with a lot of data terabytes
petabytes and more there's no rule for
how much data you need before it is big
but certainly the amount of data we have
today seems big compared to ten years
ago data analysts data scientists and
data engineers can all work with either
big data or not so big data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
