models that I want to cover so bear with
me the first one is the rational unified
software process or RUP which is a very
popular one based on UML RUP works in an
iterative way which means that it
performs different iterations and at
each iteration it performs four phases
so what I'm showing you here is a
high-level view of the process and as I
want you to focus on all the different
details because we will discuss these
details later on in a lesson that is
actually dedicated to RUP what I want to
give you now is just the gist of how
this works so in each one of these four
phases which I'm going to describe in a
second we perform standard software
engineering activities the ones that we
just discussed and we do them to
different extent based on the phase in
which we are in particular in the
inception phase the work is mostly to
scope the system so basically figuring
out what is the scope of the work what
is the scope of the project what is the
domain so that we can be able to perform
initial cost and budget estimates the
elaboration phase is the phase in which
we focus on the domain analysis and
define the basic architecture for the
system so this is a phase in which
analysis and design are particularly
relevant then there is a construction
phase which is where the bulk of the
development actually occurs and as you
can see here is where most of the
implementation happens
and finally the transition phase is the
phase in which the system goes from
development into production so that it
becomes available to users and of course
this is the phase in which the other
activities in software development
become less relevant and deployment
becomes the main one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
