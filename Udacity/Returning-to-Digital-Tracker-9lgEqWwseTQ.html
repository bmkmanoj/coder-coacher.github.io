remember that we were still left with
the problem of busy waiting where we're
wasting CPU cycles just waiting for
another thread to change the value of a
variable we're going to solve this
problem by creating a conditional weight
variable so the code will look like this
instead of having a while loop on
whether the condition is met that does
nothing the wild loop now makes a call
to Conway CPU cycles saved the second
thing to notice is that the mutex
variable is back and it gets passed in
along with the conditional weight
variable into the condo 8 procedure we
do this because we want to make sure
that the condition in this while loop
still holds when we put the thread onto
the weight variable Q the nightmare
scenario is that in between this check
and the call to condo 8 another thread
changes the condition and sends the
signal then we could be waiting for a
signal that might never come so it's
good practice to lock variables that
might cause the condition to change
before you make the cond wait call the
con wait method itself puts the active
thread on a waiting queue and then
unlocks the mutex so that another thread
can change the condition we are waiting
on when the conditional signal comes the
method then requires the box before
returning that's why we need to unlock
it again down here now somewhat
surprising we need to recheck hour
waiting predicate that is is buff avail
equal to 0 again before moving on that's
why we have the while statement here
instead of an if the reason for this is
that we might not have been the first
thread to acquire the lock another
thread might have acquired at first and
change back the condition to something
where we would need to wait again in
this digitizer example I guess maybe
that would be another tracker putting
this in a while loop so that we recheck
the predicate after the signal comes is
called rechecking the predicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
