lecture near you today yes you do I can
even see you this is this is crazy I'm
sort of don't have my regular pad this
makes me a little uncomfortable but you
look very dashing in your nice blue suit
Thanks we're gonna record some
live-action stuff today mm-hmm right so
do you remember last time we were
talking about Bayesian learning I do
because I lived that right good point
and so one of the questions that I asked
as a follow-up was these quantities
these probabilistic quantities that were
working with is there anything that we
need to know about how to represent and
reason with them and you said that I
should look into it yeah because I would
yeah usually look into it so I did so
and it's cool and so I figured it would
be fun to tell you about it okay well I
look forward to it Thanks and also I
want to point out we're using a
different color scheme today isn't that
a nice blue it is a nice blue it's just
sort of a relaxing blue as opposed to
that blue blue that we used before like
cerulean is it no it's more like
periwinkle no it's definitely not fair
oh you're right is not periwinkle
no no it's too late to be Navy all right
so so good so right so it turns out that
there's this concept called Bayesian
networks
which is this wonderful representation
for representing and manipulating
probabilistic quantities over complex
spaces and so that fits in really well
with the stuff that you were talking
about last time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
