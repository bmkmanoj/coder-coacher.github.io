write control programs to customize
network control we will review the
operation of a hub and a learning switch
then we will explore how to use the pox
controller to create a simple mini net
topology and then we will explore how to
customize the pox controller to perform
two types of network control as a review
when a host sends a packet to a hub the
hub maintains no state about which
output port a packet should be forwarded
to reach a particular destination
therefore the hub simply for words the
input packet on every output port in pox
this code is fairly simple when the
controller starts it adds a listener
that listens for a connection up which
is a connection from a switch when the
switch connects it simply sends an open
flow flow modification back to the
switch that says flood all packets out
every output port the first function
here in bold creates the open flow
message and the second sends that
message back to the switch in contrast a
learning switch maintains a switch table
that's initially empty but when a packet
arrives on input port one the switch
creates a table that associates host a
with output port 1 such that whenever a
subsequent packet is destined for
destination a the switch knows to
forward the packet via output port 1 I
won't show you the full Python code here
but it's fairly simple and you can go
look at the pox distribution to see the
learning switch example as before when
the first packet arrives at the switch
it is diverted to the controller at this
point the controller maintains a hash
table that map's the address to the
output port when it sees that first
packet
from host a it updates the address and
port table if the packet is a multicast
packet the controller makes a decision
to flood that packet on all output ports
likewise if there's no table entry for
the destination for that packet the
controller also instructs the switch to
forward the packet on all output ports
if the source and destination address
are the same the controller instructs
the switch to drop the packet otherwise
the controller installs the flow table
entry corresponding to that destination
address and output port installing that
flow table entry in the switch prevents
future packets for that flow from being
redirected to the controller rather all
subsequent packets on that flow can be
handled directly by the switch since it
now knows which output port to send a
packet for that particular destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
