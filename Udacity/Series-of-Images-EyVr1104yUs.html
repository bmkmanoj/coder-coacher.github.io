building the kinds of curves that we're
interested in from real data just to
keep things simple rather than use my
stack of real images I'm just going to
showcase these small types of ramp
grayscale images here and I basically
have kind of simulated them to have a
shutter speed of 160 for darker image
one-sixteenth one fourth one second and
four seconds it gets from darker to
brighter again we are interested in
getting to I the intensities G is my
function and the thing that we want
extract from is exposure h right i mean
that's the relationship because remember
the rest of it we actually were able to
get to from the camera itself so now to
get an exposure basically we would base
i have to compute the e radians e and
with the time and we know all of this of
course we can also do this in log
because that actually makes our curves
and everything up here nice and of
course just i'm showing this pixel
values here and i'm going to basically
create an axis the log of an exposure h
what we can do now is fine let's say
three points 1 2 and 3 here at three
different points I've colored them
differently so we can see what they are
and of course I now in this instance can
pick out what their values would be
similarly now I can find three similar
exact points in another image and I'm
actually just randomly walking around in
these five images and if you notice that
basically I can find these three points
in all of these images you know how to
get these images feature tracking and
feature detection work or feature
matching words that we looked at allows
you to find these types of things in a
real image this is just a synthetic test
case that I'm showing of course after I
find these points I can actually use
this to plot these values of course I'm
showing this purple here while I just
have five images here you can imagine I
may have more and this would allow me to
get a bunch of different values here so
here you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
and so on this allows me to kind of you
know plot these up I can do the same for
turquoise and here is the range change
that's happening in this one pixel
values log of exposure based on these
calculations again pure data
and in case of the yellow basically we
see this kind of phenomenon where
basically again we have points like this
so I took a lot of samples over 10 plus
and this is what it gave me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
