exercise let's put these pieces together
we showed three separate results that
being able to find the best or nearly
the best lets you make few mistakes
being able to make few mistakes let you
do well on average per step being able
to do well on average per step gives you
the ability to actually find a nearly
best arm so all these things are
actually equivalent if you give me an
algorithm for doing any one of these I
can derive something for doing the other
two just kind of do it in a circle here
so in a sense what this is telling us is
that we kind of don't have to pick among
these three different optimality
criteria because they're really all the
same as each other and you could sort of
say well and and you know must be that
these are the right ones to think about
because if we even if we don't think
about say this doing well on average per
step we would have to solve it anyway if
we cared about any of these other things
so i don't know i mean this what would I
get out of this is the idea that
whichever of these is most convenient
for you to work with you should just
work with it because the other ones are
going to fall out and there's other
optimality criteria that you could worry
about but I don't know it seems like a
lot of them come back down to these yeah
I like that a lot you're really saying
that they're kind of in an equivalence
class of difficulty yes now
interestingly the thing that we haven't
done yet and that we need to do is show
that we can solve any of these problems
I thought we just did we did put a lot
of words on some screens and there were
some towels yeah no no no what we showed
was that if you could solve one you
could solve the other if you could solve
that one you could say but we never said
that any of these are actually solvable
and so we need we need one more result
to kind of make this all doable okay
that's fair but so I I was satisfied
with proof by tau but if you want to you
know actually go and ground it out but
the towels where all the towels were
defined in terms of other towels it
never bottomed out right what we really
like is something that says here's an
algorithm that will in a polynomial
number of trials find you a nearly
optimal arm I don't know Michael seems
to me this is pretty straightforward
it's towels all the way down it can't be
taos all the way down why not it's
Turtles they start with the same sound
that's true I guess they're Greek
Turtles yes there it's Greek Turtles all
the way down which is what we've always
suspected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
