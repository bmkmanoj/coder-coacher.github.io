understanding of the differences between
black box testing and white box testing
I'm going to provide you a couple of
simple examples that illustrate the
strengths and limitations of these two
techniques so in this case let's start
with black box testing so we're only
working with the specification so let's
say that our specification says that
this is a program that inputs an integer
value and prints it and the
implementation we don't know because we
are working at the black box level if we
wanted to test this function according
to its specification what we will
probably do is to select a positive
integer a negative integer and the zero
as test inputs and see how the program
behaves for these inputs so let me now
show you a possible implementation for
this specification what I'm showing here
is this function that we called print
num bytes which takes the parameter and
prints it and one thing that we notice
right away is that although in the
specification numbers that are less than
1024 and numbers that are greater or
equal to 1024 are exactly equivalent
from the specification standpoint there
are however treated differently in the
code so the developer decided that the
program was just going to print the
value of the parameter if it's less than
1024 but it was actually dividing it by
1024 and printing it with a kilobyte
mark after it if you were greater than
1024 and notice that here there is a
problem the developer used the number
124 instead of 1024 so there's a
probably a typo in this point in the
code so this is a case in which by
simply doing blackbox testing so by
simply looking at the specific issue we
might miss this problem because we have
no reason to consider numbers there are
less than 1024 or greater than 1024
however if we were to look at the code
so operate in a white box manner we will
right away see that we need to have a
test case that checks the program when
the parameter is greater than 1024 and
we will find a problem right away so now
let me show you a dual example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
