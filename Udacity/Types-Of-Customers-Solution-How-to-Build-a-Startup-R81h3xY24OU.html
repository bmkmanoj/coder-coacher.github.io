officer is more than likely the economic
buyer The Saboteur might actually be the
existing business intelligence group
inside of IT or the CIOs department
who's actually trying to already build
the software and they might be afraid
they're going to lose their job so in
every major organization you might find
people who actually don't want or
actively attempt to block a sale the CIO
is more than likely the decision-maker
in some organizations they can actually
sign off on large deals but in this case
the chief information officer was
actually gonna recommend to the chief
financial officer that they buy this
software the report users the people
actually use the product in this case
they're just simply the influencers and
that's kind of interesting to remember
because sometimes as entrepreneurs we
forget that the people who use our
product are not necessarily the people
who even pay for or even recommend the
product and in this case the
recommenders were probably the line of
business management that is those users
worked for a line of business a division
or Department and the influencers the
people were used as said to their bosses
we'd really like to have the software
this would work great and their managers
who didn't have any signature authority
or couldn't actually install software
recommended them this actually get by
understanding this ecosystem is really
important not only in
business-to-business sales but sometimes
business to consumer sales as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
