left child unchanged and build up a new
tree based on this new right child so
now let's test it I'm going to make a
very simple tree that has a midpoint
right at the root and let's say that I
insert at would come a Margaret into
this tree we think it should go on the
left because Atwood is less than
midpoint a comes before M so let's try
it out and in fact it did here's our
answer here's our answer down here in
Python tubule form and here's the tree
it corresponds to mid point at the top
with at would Margaret as the left child
midpoint at the top with at would
Margaret as the left child no right
child for midpoint no children at all
for at would Margaret now let's try
inserting Zuma comma Jacob into this
tree he is a pictorial representation of
what we want to get out midpoint has
only a right child to that right child
is Zuma comma Jacob Jacob which I can't
spell and down here is the Python nested
tuple interpretation midpoint has no
left child but it does have a right
child Zuma comma Jacob but reading this
Python tuple stuff that's really hard so
let's write a procedure to walk down one
of these trees and print out everything
in order again this is a recursive
procedure if we've reached the end of
the line we don't do anything but
otherwise here's what I'm going to do
remember our rule for these trees all of
my left children are less than or equal
to me so I'll print them out first with
a recursive call then I'll print out
myself and then because all of my right
children are greater than or equal to me
I'll print them out last now let's try
this out with a little more complicated
test case I have taken a tree that has a
midpoint and then I'm inserting both
Jacob Zuma and also margaret atwood into
it would be a rare tree that would
contain both the author of the blind
assassin and also a South African
president in 2009 but you never know and
now when we print out the tree we get
all of the elements in alphabetical
order ah actually if we didn't know any
other way to sort things this tree could
be a way to put any arbitrary elements
in ascending order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
