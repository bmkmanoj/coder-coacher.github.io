root fail the answer is simple yet not
so simple what we lack here is
diagnostic information we don't know the
values of R or Z or anything that
happens in between so what we do is we
set up a framework that allows us to
access these so what we have set here is
we have set up a try except block around
the square root function which catches
the assertion and when an assertion is
being raised or any other kind of error
as being raised we print out the
offending parameter R and we exit the
loop so let's see what happens here if
we invoke the whole thing so here's the
bad value 8436 dot dot 920 seven eight
six five Wow magic value so why can't we
just square this what's wrong here so we
print out their value and now we go and
actually square the square it and
multiply it by itself let's see what we
get again we around the whole thing r 2
1230 1753 488 and this is to 1230 1753
for a eight well by all means and
measures these two look identical to me
so why does the assertion above your
fail we can solve the mystery simply by
looking at the actual difference between
these two values so let's see what the
numerical difference is between the
square root squared and the original
value itself here comes another value
which fails 9000 49 or something and
here at the very end you see the
difference it's 10 to the power of minus
2 12 meaning that 12 digits after the
comma we do have a difference between R
and the square root of R squared the
reason why this assertion failed is
simply a rounding error the numbers are
the same up to the eleventh digit at the
twelfth digit digit they actually are
different and this is why the assertion
failed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
