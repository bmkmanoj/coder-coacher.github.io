created by Miss coach every and is
maintained by Google but what's so
important about angular why should you
even care about it angular is a powerful
framework that can manage your entire
application if you don't want all that
power though you can pick and choose
from angular's list of features it
doesn't force you into any specific file
structure or way to organize your code
this can be very liberating a downside
though is that every angular project you
work on could be different so angular
lets you control the app structure and
capabilities keep in mind Uncle Ben's
advice with great power comes great
responsibility another one of angular's
awesome features is two-way data-binding
to wade data what here's a trim down
version of how a template gets its data
here's a data object that gets fed into
the template this is a very high level
overview but pay attention to name in
both of these sections a typical
framework retrieves the data and
displays it in the template it's a
one-way singular fetch of information
angular retrieves its data in a similar
way but with two-way data binding the
information you add delete or change in
the browser updates the underlying data
object why don't we take angular for a
spin and see how amazing it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
