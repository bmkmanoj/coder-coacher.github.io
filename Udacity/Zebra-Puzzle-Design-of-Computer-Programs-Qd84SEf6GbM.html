sec I was just sketching out a business
plan on the back of this napkin so I
have an idea then question marks and
then profit but you know this just
doesn't work so well these napkins
they're so porous the markers don't work
on them I think I'm gonna throw away
this cliche and move to a different
cliche at the back of the envelope much
easier to write on a back of the
envelope and it's a really valuable
skill it's a valuable skill in real life
to be able to do quick and dirty
calculations and it's especially useful
for computer programmers it allows
computer programmers to have the
important virtue of being lazy you don't
normally think of lazy as being a virtue
but it is it allows us to say we're
going to come up with the simplest
design we can validate on the back of an
envelope that that design is efficient
or not for what we're trying to do and
then we can stop we don't have to try to
make it more complex this whole class is
about managing complexity and one of the
most important ways to manage complexity
is to leave it out completely just go
for the simple solution if we can do
that but then we're well on our way to
better designs in this class we'll learn
how to do that we'll learn how to do the
calculations of when you're efficient
enough we'll learn when to stop and
we'll learn how to make programs more
efficient I'm gonna start with a
well-known puzzle called the zebra
puzzle and here's the description of it
we're gonna try to address this puzzle
see if we can come up with a program to
solve it and explore the methodology for
how we come up with that solution and
the process of deciding what's a good
enough solution and whether a brute
force solution will work you can read
the description of the puzzle here now
let's start to analyze it we'll begin
with an inventory of the concepts in the
puzzle just to make sure that we
understand what's going on so the first
concept is houses we're told there's
five of them and then there's properties
of the inhabitants of these houses and
of the houses themselves so there's
nationality colors of the houses the
pets that they own the drinks that they
drink and the smokes that they smoke and
then in addition to properties there's a
notion of assignment of properties to
houses and you can think of that either
you can assign think of it as assigning
house number to the color red or think
of it as assigning red to house number
two then there's a notion of locations
the locations one through five they
mentioned the idea of the first house
and the middle house and of the next to
relation and of the immediately to the
right relation and I think that covers
most of what was in the specification
let's go back to it and and see if it
works
so I'm seeing lots of concepts that
we've already covered five houses
Englishman red house Spaniard dog now
there's a few words that we haven't
covered things like lives in and owns
the we covered them in a generic sense
of saying it's an assignment of
Englishman to a house an assignment of
the dog to to a house but the question
is do we need to separate out the
different types of assignment so the
question is are we missing this property
that's idea of say a property name with
a description attached and so for
example the property name would be
nationality in the description is is
lived in do we need to name them like
that or do we just need the notion of a
Property Group to say that the there are
these properties of Englishmen Spaniard
Norwegian Japanese and Ukrainian and the
five of them would go together but we
don't need the name for them or can we
ignore this notion of grouping
altogether now this is somewhat
subjective what's a good design choice
but tell me which of these three do you
think are plausible or reasonable design
choices and check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
