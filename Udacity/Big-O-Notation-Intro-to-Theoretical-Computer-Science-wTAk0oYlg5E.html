analyzing algorithms that you need to
know about before we can analyze Alice
algorithm as we've just seen even
talking about worst-case running time
can be a bit tricky if we're trying to
be very precise so we have to identify
the worst-case input in detail which can
be counterintuitive and then work
through a lot of different cases and
also as you notice it's annoying to have
to count every single step and algorithm
aches so for example if you had two
algorithms and one had a running time of
2n squared plus 23 time steps and the
other one had two and squared plus 27
time steps you wouldn't really care
about the 23 of the 27 you would say
that essentially they have the same
running time so we are going to
introduce a huge simplification to
stating running times and that is called
Big O notation if you've had an
algorithms course before you should
already be familiar with this but we'll
review it here just to make sure you
understand so let's say we have two
algorithms algorithm a and algorithm B
and algorithm a has a running time of 3
n squared minus n plus 10 for an input
of size n and algorithm B has a running
time of 2 to the power of n minus 50 n
plus 256 so what I would like you to
think about is which of these two
algorithms you would prefer if you don't
know anything about the input other than
that you're going to get different sizes
so no other structural assumptions or
anything else that you know and I would
like you to check this box if you think
it's algorithm a that you should take in
general and this box if you think its
algorithm B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
