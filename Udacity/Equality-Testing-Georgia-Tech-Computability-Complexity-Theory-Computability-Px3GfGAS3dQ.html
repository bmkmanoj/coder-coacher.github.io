in computing with Turing machines and
how to overcome them we'll examine this
task here where we're given an input
string and we want to tell if it is of
the form W hash W where W is a binary
restraint otherwise we reject it I'll
the basic idea on this example first we
X out the first symbol on the tape and
then we're gonna go look to see if the
first element past the hash is the same
symbol so the fact that I read a 0 here
somehow has to be encoded in the Machine
state so we'll go along to the first
symbol after the hash and indeed it is a
0 if it wasn't then we can reject the
input right away those two strings on
either side of the hash unequal we exit
that 0 so that we know not to check it
again and we move left pass the hash
over to the first X after that that we
encounter and now we're ready to repeat
that process we X out the one this time
remembering the fact that it was a 1 in
the machine State we can forget that the
previous symbol was a 0 by now and then
we move right past the hash past all the
X's to the next non x symbol that we see
this is a 1 which matches what we asked
out before that's great we exit out and
then we rewind past the hash to the
first X that we encounter at this point
the next symbol is a hash so we know
that the string to the left of the hash
matches the first part of this string to
the right but there might be more to the
right so we check to make sure that we
crossed off all the zeros and ones to
the right of the hash if we didn't then
we reject because there wasn't a match
the string on the right was too long as
Turing machines go this is a pretty
simple program but as you can see here
the state diagram gets a little messy
like the sips or textbook I've used a
little shorthand here in the diagram
when two symbols appear to the left of
the arrow I mean to match either one of
those it's easier than writing out a
whole nother edge also sometimes I will
only give a direction on the right
interpret that to mean that the tape
should be left alone here's our initial
state Q 0 from here we usually read eye
zero or one and proceeded down one of
these two parallel paths we need
parallel paths here because we have to
remember whether it was a zero or a one
that we read initially we move past the
rest of the first string to the hash and
then past any ex doubt symbols to the
next either a 0 or a 1
actually if we encounter a blank that
means that the second string was too
short and we can reject immediately or
if we encounter a 1 when we're looking
for a 0 that also means that we reject
if we encounter a 0 on this side however
that means that we found a match and we
can begin the rewind process and this
path is exactly analogous when we do
find the match we exit out and then
begin the rewind process rewinding past
all the X's then we encounter a hash and
then we rewind past all the zeros and
ones till we encounter the first X and
then we move the symbol to the right so
that we're reading the next symbol in
the first string that was input and then
we're ready to begin this process again
when in this phase we encounter the hash
mark that means that we've matched all
of this first string here and so we just
need to check that this string here
isn't any longer so we move past all the
x's and if we encounter a blank next
that's greatly except if we encounter
something else then we need to reject
take a minute to look this all over
carefully and convince yourself that
it's right it helps to trace through an
example
we'll do this for the input 0 1 hash 0 1
of course we start in the initial state
Q 0 and we read a 0 so we transition to
the state Q 1 xing out that 0 so this
becomes our new configuration next we
read a 1 so we stay in this state and
just move the head to the right next we
encounter the hash so we move to state Q
3 and move the head to the right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
