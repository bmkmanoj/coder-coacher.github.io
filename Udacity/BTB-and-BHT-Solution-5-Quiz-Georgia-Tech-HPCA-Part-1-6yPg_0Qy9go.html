and BHT quiz we have a PhD that has 16
entries and it's a one bit predictor
each of the entries is a single bit that
tells us what the last outcome was and
initially they start all at predicting
not taken the question was how many miss
predictions do we have for each
instruction initially the BH this has
not taken for all of the entries and we
have already seen that the BHT entry
that we will use are all different so
these branches and other instructions
are not going to interfere with each
other each of them just uses its own BHT
entry because the initial prediction is
not taken and this is indeed not a taken
branch we have zero miss predictions
here same here when we enter the loop
this branch is actually not taken so we
have no miss prediction the first time
we executed this instruction here is
predicted not taken the first time it's
not taken for real so every other time
that we execute it it's going to be
predicted not taken correctly so there
is ZERO miss predictions and same thing
happens here and here and here for this
branch things are more interesting
the initial prediction in the BHT is
going to be not taken but this branch is
taken so we have a misprediction the
first time this branch is taken then the
BHT entry for that instruction is
updated to say taken so every other time
that we execute this instruction is
correctly predicted as taken so we have
only the one miss prediction initially
for this branch it's never taken until
the very last time the hundred and first
time we do it every time it's not taken
we have a correct prediction because we
start out in the not taken state of the
predictor and just keep doing that the
last time we need to execute this branch
it is taken and the last outcome that we
have seen was not taken so there will be
again a single miss prediction here so
as you can see the one bit predictor is
very accurate we are executing a lot of
instructions this one is done 101 times
this one is done a hundred times these
are done 100 times each so for what
amounts to more than 600 instruction
executions we
only have two mispredictions this shows
that the one bit predictor really works
well for things like loops that execute
many iterations however we will see
later that it doesn't work well for some
of the other things like for example
loops that don't have many iterations or
if the analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
