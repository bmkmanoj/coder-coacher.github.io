complex collection of technologies that
you have and but I understand that
you've developed a novel approach to
architecting these applications call
layer blocks can you tell us a little
bit but what motivated you to do this
sure so thus far we've talked largely
about kind of how the the high-level
deployment architecture of the system
works um what makes it interesting but
I've been pretty abstract with respect
to the code itself and what gets loaded
into those databases you may recall at
the beginning I was saying that one
thing that makes our company a little
different and our technology stack a
little different is that we actually
install code into the databases and you
can think of those databases is being
active rather than passive they're
actively calculating and coming up with
results rather than just being dumb data
stores so that code that we write and
install in those databases itself has
some interesting software engineering
challenges because we implement all of
the business rules in our in our
applications in that in that code and
then install it and one of the things we
found is that particularly with
applications like forecast managers and
most of the other predictive
applications that we're developing is
that we often find we often are not
developing a single product but in fact
we're developing something more akin to
a product line that is we find that
there are many different slightly
different variants of of use of the same
algorithm like like forecasting but the
need to be deployed in slightly
different ways for slightly different
contexts and so what motivated layer
blocks was after we had been doing some
development on the forecast manager
application the first forecast manager
application we we noticed that a lot of
the work we were doing was was was kind
of developing code that we really seemed
redundant that um we were developing the
same kinds of algorithms multiple times
for these different different uses and
we wanted to find a way to unify that so
we could do the development once very
efficiently and
and manage this growing list of variants
of the same component of functionality
so this is getting back to the the
challenge you mentioned at the start
about that each customer has their own
specific needs okay but that you'd like
to the extent possible to have a common
solution to reduce your costs of dealing
with the customers exactly yeah you
don't want to have to develop a system a
component from scratch for each
customer's you've got 100 customers you
don't have to develop a hundred
components what you want to do is you
want to develop one component very
nicely so that it can be configured and
packaged in different ways very easily
and that's what that's what we developed
later high school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
