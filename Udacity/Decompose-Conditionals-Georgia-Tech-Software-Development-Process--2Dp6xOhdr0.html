which is the decomposed conditional
refactoring what happens here is that in
some cases the complexity of the
conditional logic in a program can make
a method hard to read and understand
specifically we might have one or more
particularly complex conditional
statements and similar to what we
discussed for the previous refactoring
the conditional if it's too complex
might tell you what happens but obscure
why it happens
to address this issue you can do a
similar thing to what we did in the
previous refactoring you can transform
the condition into a method and then
replace the condition with a call to
that method and if you give the right
name to the method as we saw in the last
example that can make the code much
clearer and much easier to understand in
addition here you can also do something
else let's assume that also that then an
else part of the conditional are complex
we can do the same thing with them so
what we can do we can modify the then
and as part of the conditional by
extracting the corresponding code making
also dead one into a method suitably
named in the method and then having the
call to the method only in the dinin as
part of the conditional statement so
let's see how that works with an example
here we have the Metall they compute
some charge and it computes the charge
based on some characteristics of the
date that is provided as input let's
imagine or is just you know one of the
fields in the class so as you can see
there is a conditional here that checks
that if the dates is before the
beginning of the summer so before summer
start or it's after the summer end then
you compute the charge using some winter
rate otherwise if you are in the summer
it will compute the quantity the charge
using a summer rate and this is just a
small example so it might not look that
complex but you know just project this
on more realistic code on larger code
you can end up with the conditions that
are hard to understand and even in this
case even such a small piece of code you
have to kind of look at the conditionals
figure out what does it mean for the day
to be before the summer start and after
the summer and we can make this much
clearer so how can we do it by applying
this refactoring as we described let's
see what happens when I apply the
decompose conditionals refactoring to
this method the first thing I will do is
to take this condition create a method
that perform exactly the same check give
it a meaningful name in this case I
called it not summer which is pretty
self-explanatory and then replacing the
conditional with a call to that method
so as you can see here there is a clear
improvement
in the code because here I just need to
look at this statement and I see right
away that they check what the check is
doing is just checking whether the date
is in the summer or not so much easier
than having to interpret this condition
and the second thing I do is to take the
code that computes the charge and also
in this case creating suitable methods
that compute the winter charge and the
summer charge and I call them exactly
winter charge and summer charge which
again is self-explanatory and then I
replace this computation with a call to
that method so again when I look at this
code I can clearly see that the charge
is computed using some sort of winter
charge calculation and then using some
sort of summer charge calculation and if
I don't want to know how this is exactly
computed that's all I need to know to
understand what this method does easier
and faster than looking at this method
and figuring out what it does and if I
need to look at the details exactly like
in the previous case I can just go and
look at the implementation of winter
charge and summer charge but I will be
looking at that in its specific context
so without having to understand
everything at once so in this way you
make it clear both while you are doing
something because it's not summer and
what exactly you're doing you're
computing a winter charge or a summer
charge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
