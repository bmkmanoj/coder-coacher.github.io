procedure for reducing a system of
equations to as simple a form as
possible ideally finding the unique
solution of a system if it exists
we'll start by informally describing the
procedure and using it to solve some
example systems of equations then we'll
explore some special cases that can
occur during the algorithm once we have
a better intuition about the algorithm
then we'll begin to write code which
will define the algorithms precise
operation the algorithm we will discuss
is a classic algorithm called Gaussian
elimination though it is named after the
19th century German mathematician Carl
Gauss the algorithm was known to the
Chinese as early as the 2nd century BCE
the basic idea of Gaussian elimination
is to gradually clear variables and
successive equations so the first
equation will have all the variables XY
and Z then the next equation we'll end
up with just Y and Z and then the last
equation will just have Z that way the
last equation just becomes Z equals some
number and then since the second
equation only has y&amp;amp;z and we know the
value of Z this allows us to find the
value of y finally we use the values of
Y and C in the first equation to find
the value of x giving us the solution
presuming there is a unique solution
after all we can do this by adding or
subtracting appropriate amounts of an
equation from all equations underneath
let's look at this example system X
minus 3y plus Z equals 4 negative 3x
plus 9y plus Z equals 0 and y minus Z
equals 1 in order to clear the X term
from the second equation we can add 3
times the first equation to the second
remember that adding or subtracting
multiples of equations is a valid
operation this transforms the second
equation into 4 Z equals 12
now we could go ahead and use the second
equation to find the value of Z but for
now we're going to ignore the shortcut
and show how the procedure works in
general like we did before with the X
term
the first equation we want there to be a
y term in the second equation so that we
can use it to clear y terms below the
second equation that way we have
successive loss of variables if like in
this case there is no y term in the
second equation we look to below the
second equation for one with a y term
then we can swap the second equation for
the equation with the y term in this
case we'll swap equations two and three
to get a y term in the second row again
this is one of our valid equation
operations now the second equation is y
minus Z equals one and the third
equation is for Z equals twelve
we have no y terms underneath the second
equation so there are no more terms to
clear finally since we're at the bottom
equation there are no terms underneath
the Z term in the third equation notice
that our system of equations is in a
special form each variable that appears
as a leading term doesn't appear in any
further equations this form is sometimes
given a special name such as triangular
form or row echelon form in this lesson
we will call it triangular form however
this system does not represent the same
set of planes as the system we started
with by adding and subtracting equations
we do change the planes involved however
we have changed them in such a way that
the common intersections of the planes
remains the same once we've reached
triangular form our next task is to
clear upwards so that way we isolate
each variable in its own equation first
we're going to solve for Z in the bottom
equation by multiplying it through by
one fourth notice that this is the third
equation operation we had defined
earlier this gives us the bottom
equation now reading Z equals 3/2 clear
upwards we can add the third equation to
the second equation this makes the
second equation become y equals 4 then
subtracting the third equation from the
first equation gives us X minus 3 y
equals 1 notice that Z is now in its own
column now let's focus
why we've already solved for y y equals
four so the last step is to clear up
words so that Y is also in its own
column to do this we add three times the
second equation to the first which makes
the first equation become x equals 13
using just the three operations we
spelled out earlier we have found the
sole point of intersection of the three
planes described in the original system
of equations note that we can check that
the point 13 comma 4 comma 3 satisfies
all three equations in the original
system I'd like to run through this set
of operations one more time but this
time including a plot of the three
planes that these equations represent
that way you can see visually what
Gaussian elimination is doing one thing
to keep in mind is that the common
intersection of the planes defined by
these three equations should never
change during our operations that we use
after the first operation notice that
the green plane has rotated along its
intersection line with the red plane and
is now entirely horizontal the second
operation which swaps two equations just
changes the color of two of the planes
the third operation which multiplies
equation 3 by 1/4 doesn't change the
blue plane at all by adding the third
equation to the second equation and
isolating the Y variable the green plane
which is y equals 4 is now perfectly
orthogonal to the y axis next clearing
the Z variable from the first equation
means that the red plane no longer has
any dependency on the Z variable finally
eliminating the Y variable from the
first equation makes the red plane
perfectly orthogonal to the x axis and
now the meeting point of the three
planes is easily identifiable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
