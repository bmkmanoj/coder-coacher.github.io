a list of expert perspectives I've
already paired down some of my
perspective so that I can fit on the
page and normally I would go back and
forth between this brainstorming it's
it's not as clear-cut as I made it look
here but that's okay so now I want to
choose one of these and pair it with one
of these and remember the perspective
shift it's not just fluff it really is
the sort of cognitive justification for
why the student is doing the task you
select and that perspective is going to
be instrumental in the next phase of
lesson design it's going to really
inform how you lay out the rest of the
lesson so make sure you give a lot of
thought to what this pairing is and the
pairing i settled on as you know is to
keep this perspective shift and this
task now I'm going to save these because
students aren't just going to be doing
one task in this lesson this is just
sort of the ultimate task the final task
that proves to me they've gotten the
point of the lesson they may very well
do some of these others as intermediate
steps I like this pairing because
multiplication really is about
repetition in one of the other
perspective shifts I was considering
multiplication was going to be about
calculating area or manipulating
rectangles and while manipulating
rectangles is a good sort of
intermediate step towards building
familiarity with what multiplication
really is it's not the entirety of what
multiplication actually is repetition is
much closer so here we're going to be
using this technique of drawing dots
which still gets some of that benefit of
using rectangles and having a nice
visual approach but we're going to be
focusing on multiplication as an
instruction to repeat this feels like
it's shaping up to be a solid lesson of
course there's a lot of work to do with
coming up with an outline and figuring
out the sequence of steps to go from
novice to expert but I'm very confident
that at the end if students are
successful in completing this task
they'll have learned what I want them to
learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
