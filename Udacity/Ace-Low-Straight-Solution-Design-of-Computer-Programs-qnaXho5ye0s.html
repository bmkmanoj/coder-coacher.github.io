of returning the ranks directly what i
want to do is say under one condition if
the ranks is equal to this ace high or a
slow straight rather then I want to fix
it and otherwise I want to leave it the
same so if the ranks is equal to this a
slow will fill in that later if that's
the case then what I want to return is a
fix which is five four three two one so
this is the only time when I'm returning
a one as a value up here we had two and
above there was no one that you could
return but now in eighths instead of
being 14 we're going to count the ACE as
a one and we're going to do that only in
the case when the ranks that we had so
far was an ace 2 3 4 5 which according
to the sorting would have come out as 14
5 4 3 2 and I've gotten the syntax of
backwards here when I did the insertion
so what I want to say is returned 5 4 3
2 1 which would be the correct ordering
for where we want to put an ace if we
had ace 2 3 4 5 as our hand and for any
other hand just return the ranks as is
and my claim is that this will make
everything work because now we're cook
we've taken this one hand that was
problematic and we corrected it by
making an ASBO one instead of a 14 and
now all the other comparisons of ranks
will work out properly this will in fact
be a straight because five minus one is
for and there's five different cards and
the high value in here will in fact be a
five and not the ACE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
