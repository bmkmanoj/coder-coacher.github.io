behavioral diagram I want to discuss is
the sequence diagram so what is the
sequence diagram it's an interaction
diagram that emphasizes how objects
communicate and the time ordering of the
messages between objects to illustrate
sequence diagrams in a practical way and
hopefully in a clearer way I will
introduce them by creating an actual
sequence diagram using an example taken
from our course management system so
let's see what are the steps needed to
build such a sequence diagram the first
thing you want to do is to place the
objects that participate in the
interaction at the top of the diagram
along the x-axis and you also want to
place them in a specific way you want to
place object and initiate the
interaction at the left and place
increasingly more subordinate objects to
the right so basically this should
reflect the way the events will flow for
the majority of the interactions in the
system next thing you want to do is to
add what is called an object lifeline
it's a vertical line that shows the
existence of objects over a period of
time and it's normally represented with
the dashed line except for the outermost
object for which it is a solid line now
that you have your object life line you
can start placing messages that these
objects send and receive you want to put
them along the y-axis in order of
increasing time from top to bottom and
you can also put a number on the message
to further clarify the sequence so in
this case what we are showing is that
the student will send a fill-in info
message to the registration form and
this is the first message in the
sequence diagram the first interaction
then the student might submit the form
and this is also a message that goes to
the registration form at this point when
the submission takes place the
registration form will send the message
so we'll invoke some functionality in
the registration manager specifically it
will invoke the add course functionality
and pass Joe the name of the students
and math 101 which is the specific
course for which Joe is registering then
the registration manager will ask the
math 101 course whether it accepts
registrations and the interaction will
continue so the math 101 will actually
check for a specific offering if
everything goes fine it will receive an
akka you will send back the act to the
registration manager and so on until at
the end Joe will be registered for math
101 as you can see it is very easy
to see how the interaction occurs
between these different objects at
runtime dynamically so what the behavior
of the system is for this specific
scenario so the last notational element
that I want to add to this diagram is
the focus of control which is this tall
thin rectangle that shows the period of
time that an object is performing an
action either directly or indirectly so
if you look at the registration form
this is telling out that the
registration form is active for this
amount of time and the same thing we can
do for the registration manager the math
101 course offering and the math 101
