about the question what's going on when
we test software it turns out the answer
is a lot of different things are going
on so here I'd like to start off with
the output produced by a test case it's
going to pass through the acceptability
check and what we're doing when we check
the output of a test case for
acceptability is we're running a little
experiment and this experiment can have
two possible results one result is the
outputs okay which case we're going to
go run another test case the question is
what do we learn in that case and the
answer is unfortunately not very much
what we might have done at best is
increased our confidence just a tiny
tiny bit that the software under test is
correct it is it's what happens we stand
to learn a whole lot more when the
output is not okay and the processor I'm
going to talk about right now is if the
acceptability check fails that is to say
the test output is not okay we have to
discover what's happening and so of
course what we expect is much of the
time we'll have found a bug in the
software under test that's a case we're
going to go fix it and if not there's
still plenty of other possibilities and
one of the main ones is a bug in our
acceptability check if so we're going to
fix it if not we should consider the
possibility there might be a bug in our
specification it's often the case the
debugging the specification is a fairly
large part of debugging because the
specification often is not written down
or it's not written down particularly
formally it's just sort of a it's just
an English document or an understanding
among a group of people and very often
we're learning what it is that we needed
to implement as we're implementing the
software so if that's not the case
though if the bug was not in our
acceptability check not in the software
under test and not in the specification
now we actually have we still have some
possibilities but they're getting more
difficult to deal with some of the worst
debugging stories that you hear stem
from a flaw in the operating system and
the compiler in runtime libraries or
even in the hardware since fixing these
kind of bugs is often not an option for
us because we've purchased these things
or otherwise gotten these from some
other vendor often they have to be
worked around and this can be extremely
painful so if that is the case we have a
hard road ahead of us but at least we
know therefore where the flaw is that's
not the case we're at a bit of an
impasse so what is it that's really
going on here what's the big picture
here well as I was saying what a test is
is a tiny experiment where a failed test
feels that something is wrong reveals
that something is flawed in either our
understanding of the system or in some
part of the system and there might be a
fairly elaborate process in figuring out
what the problem is these kind of
discoveries that we're making about the
system that we're using I'm not
necessarily a problem because these are
things that we need to know if we're
going to create correct software in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
