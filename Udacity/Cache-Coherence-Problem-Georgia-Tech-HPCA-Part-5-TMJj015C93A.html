with cache coherence that is do we even
need cache coherence our programmer is
expecting to see shared memory behavior
that means that when one core writes
let's say 15 to a variable and then
another core reads that variable it will
read what the last write put there this
is how 2 cores communicate through
shared memory one writes something to a
shared memory address another one reads
it and expects to see the data that was
written there but in our Hardware each
core has its own cache and we need
course to have their own caches at least
in the level one because a single large
level one cache would be too slow and
would not have enough throughput to keep
up with the requests from all of the
cores so because we cannot do this we
have private or perc or l1 caches so
each core has its own however once you
have these private caches here is what
can happen this is the core a with the
level 1 cache for core a this is corby
and it has its own level 1 cache so we
said that let's say core a writes X
equals 15
suppose this is a cache miss we use the
address of X to index into our cache
check the tag whether it corresponds to
X and then if this is a cache miss we go
to our main memory and fetch the whole
block into a cache let's say that in
this block X is 0
once we fetch it into our cache we write
our 15 here so now we had a 15 in our
cache here now let's say that core B
wants to read X so it wants to see what
X is it uses the address of X to index
into its own cache sees that it doesn't
have what it's looking for there and
reads the block from main memory this
block here has 0 for X still because we
didn't write back from ace cache yet so
we end up reading 0 which is not correct
and note that this doesn't occur only
the first time when we have a cache miss
from now on a can write to its own l1
cache
many many times B can read from its own
cache many many times a will keep
writing to its cash and not updating
memory B will keep reading from its cash
and not checking back from memory
because once we bring it into the cache
it's going to be a hit B is never
modifying it it's always going to read
zero no matter how many times a write 15
or something else here so obviously we
are not getting the communication of
data we want from AIDS writes to B's
reads and thus our shared memory doesn't
work when we get in a shared memory
system behavior like this we say that it
is incoherent the same memory location
as seen from different cores can have
different values which is not what
should be happening in a shared memory
in order to not get a incoherent system
we need an active approach to cache
coherence that will make this whole
thing behave as a single memory even
though in reality there are multiple
copies of the data floating around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
