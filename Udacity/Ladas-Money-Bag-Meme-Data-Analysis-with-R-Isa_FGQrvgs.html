are some recent projects that you've
been working on so one thing I'm really
fascinated by is how information flows
through networks so in my early work
this was just how web pages link
together but with online social networks
being such a prevalent means of
communicating these days there's a lot
of transmission from individual to
individual or from individual to their
social network and there are these
things called memes which are ideas that
seem to almost take advantage of this to
replicate themselves so some Facebook
status updates for example will have a
little piece of text that says a copy
and paste or repost or post this so that
all your friends will see if you agree
with this statement one interesting
thing about means is that they tend to
recur over time so sometimes you see him
even it's like oh yeah I saw that one a
year ago now it's back and how does it
come back so we looked at one particular
meme this is the moneybags mean which
says that you know this year October has
five Fridays Saturdays Sundays this
happens only once every eight hundred
and twenty three years and this is a
lucky occurrence fall Obama and anyone
who actually looks it up sees that this
kind of occurrence is much more frequent
and in fact you'll have different
variants of the meme for example here in
red you have the one that says July has
five Fridays Saturdays Sundays and this
is true in 2011 and if you just look at
this plot which will on a linear scale
show you the counts for this meme it may
appear as though it just disappears
completely in between so you might think
well maybe it's being introduced from
some other source and not Facebook but
the weird thing is that the meme is
adapted to Facebook it says copy and
paste which doesn't make so much sense
for other media so is it possible that
the meme is actually staying within
Facebook but in very low numbers and
then flares up and so if you instead of
using a linear scale use a log scale
here at the same time you can see counts
that are a hundred thousand and counts
that are ten
and so here when you look you can see
that even though there's a rapid decay
in interest it actually looks like it's
maybe power-law and you can see the mean
persisting in low numbers and then
different variants perhaps being
prompted by a resurgence of this meme
then subsequently occurring these were
done in ggplot just with a simple line
Geum and grouping by the particular meme
variant and then rescaling the AK the
y-axis to log and one of the versions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
