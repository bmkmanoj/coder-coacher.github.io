probability that the message is M star
divided by the number of keys to see why
let's think about our probability space
so we have all the possible messages
being ordered so we have message zero
message one all the possible messages
and there's some message that we've
selected that's message M star we don't
want to assume that the messages are
uniformly distributed so the probability
that the messages M star is not
necessarily one divided by the number of
messages if the messages were uniformly
distributed then this answer would also
be correct but they're not we don't want
to assume that maybe the attacker has
some prior knowledge about the
distribution of messages and that's
normally the case even if we don't know
anything about the particular messages
well maybe we know it's a message in
English and most random strings of text
are not messages in English the other
dimension in our probability space is
the choice of the key and there are K
possible keys so what we want to know is
what is the intersection of these two
events so the M star event is this line
in our probability space each one of
these keys met exactly one message to
see we saw that before that there's one
key that map's each message to C so we
can think of that as being a diagonal
line through our probability space this
is the line where the encryption of ki
and M I is equal to C depending on what
C is it might not be a diagonal line but
we can think of it that way that there's
one key that map's each message to each
ciphertext so that means there's exactly
one point here where those two intersect
if the distributions were normal well
that would indeed be the correct answer
that it's one point in their spaces size
of M times size of K but the
distribution isn't normal we don't want
to make any assumptions about the
distribution of M for the keys we do
want to assume that the distribution is
normal that each key is equally likely
the keys are chosen perfectly at random
so we have the probability of picking M
star and we're multiplying that by the
probability of picking this intersecting
key and we'll call that K star but
because the keys are uniformly
distributed
we know that this probability is 1 over
k1 over the size of K we don't know that
about the messages so we leave that
probability as it is so that's why this
is the answer to the probability that
the message of M star intersected with
the encryption of the message is C so
now let's go back to our definition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
