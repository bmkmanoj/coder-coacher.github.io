interpreter for JavaScript that just
runs Python in the end anyway shouldn't
we just write our code in Python
directly and skip the middle step it's
an interesting idea and one that I think
gets to the heart of language design
programming languages as we know them
are actually relatively old in history
of computer science jaan bacha started
with speed coding perhaps the first
interpreted language in 1953 and moved
on to fortran which is still alive and
going well in around 1957 around the
same time Admiral Grace Hopper made the
first compiler around 1952 and started
really promulgating languages like flow
Matic in 1957 let's imagine that we
transplant this question back in time
you're in the 60s saying you know if i
write this program in fortran ultimately
it gets interpreted in assembly language
in machine code why should i bother with
fortran why not write it all in assembly
language or these days more modern
languages like Java were initially
implemented in languages like C why
bother with Java we could write
everything in C well it turns out that
all of the modern programming languages
that we are considering Java C++ C sharp
F sharp are all Turing complete a term I
won't define in this class explicitly
but it deals with Turing and models of
computations they're all equally
powerful anything I could do in one
language I could do in another so now
it's a matter of choice and expediency
some languages make it easier to write
some things or say some thoughts than
others and some make it easier to do it
with fewer errors and that's where I
think the key motivations for modern
languages really come from I think in
the future we're going to see an
explosion of proliferation a profusion
of domain-specific languages languages
that aren't trying to be C or Java but
are trying to solve a very particular
problem and do it quite well there
already a number of languages out there
for dealing with mathematics things like
MATLAB or maple or Mathematica there are
a number of ones out there for
describing graphics game design actual
has a history of using a number of
domain-specific languages going all the
way back to quake see from John Carmack
even more modern at the time of this
writing modern games like Skyrim feature
their own languages for describing
events in quests papyrus check it out
although they're based on relatively old
programming language concepts another
more modern example is there are a
number of hardware definition languages
VHDL and verilog whenever Intel to some
degree decides to design a new chip they
use a hardware definition language
rather than C or Java or Python to
describe it and these domain-specific
languages hold out the promise of having
higher level operations and of helping
you catch common mistakes and that's
really important in economic terms for
saving money and software engineering I
want to make it take less time for you
to write the program and I want to
reduce the number of faults that we're
going to find in it later I think one of
the advantages of more modern languages
over something like see is that they
feature higher order data types in
Python if you want a list or a
dictionary it's easy to write it with
just a little bit of syntax in C you'd
need to have those data types prepared
or do all of the allocation yourself it
just takes longer and it's easier for
errors to creep in think one of the
things that's been driving changes in
programming languages over time is that
we're recognizing that correctness is
often more important than speed for many
applications speed is still critical but
bugs can be really expensive especially
in the financial district or in
mission-critical applications if you're
making an airplane auto pilot or an
artificial heart pump languages where
one line of code creates a dictionary
and initializes it with some value save
you a lot of work you don't have to
write out all of the lines to create
that dictionary and as a result you
don't have to write out any lines with
bugs in them the fewer lines you can
write the more you can just declare your
will and have the compiler fill it in
the happier I am so I think that there
is a real reason to keep designing new
languages even if we boot strap them on
top of the old ones because it might be
easier and more concise to think a
thought in the new language or because
the new language might help us reduce
errors for software engineering defects
so even though our simple JavaScript
interpreter is ultimately written in
Python webpages typically include
JavaScript rather than Python it's handy
people find it easier to write in one of
these languages rather than the other
even though they're altering complete
and can express the same computations
it's kind of a deep question and one
that gets to personal choice and
creativity sometimes we just prefer one
language over another even if they're
all ultimately the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
