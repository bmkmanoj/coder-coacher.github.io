place i will make a views that PI file
to handle the logic of actually
registering a new user I will structure
this endpoint such that a client can
register a new user with a post request
to slash users the body of this request
needs to be a JSON object that has
username and password fields let's take
a look at the implementation of this
flask route the username and password
arguments are obtained from the JSON
input coming from the request and then
validated if the arguments are valid
that a new user instance is created the
user name is assigned to it and the
password is hashed using the hash
password method the user is then finally
written to the database the body of the
response shows the user representation
as a JSON object with the status code of
201 so let me run my application and try
registering a new user with postman like
so build this request in curl by using
the following command line text my
server responds that a new user has
successfully been created the views dot
pie and muddled up PI files are
available in the instructor notes it's
also important to point out that in a
real application log in should always be
done over secure HTTP connection if the
login credentials are going to travel
through the network in clear text they
are easily visible to a potential hacker
if you are interested in learning more
about HTTPS and flask check out some of
the resources provided in the instructor
notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
