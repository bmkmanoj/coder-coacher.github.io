do the sneaky thing that I did in the
last proof I'm going to put in verse
hauled into this list of programs so if
inverse halt is run on itself there can
only be two cases right so halt can
either say yes or no we know it has to
be one of the two cases because there's
no other possibility now just as above
here what would that mean so if halt on
inverse halt and inverse halt would say
yes that would mean that inverse halt
and I'm just going to write it like this
so inverse halt stops given inverse halt
as an input and the other case of course
would mean that inverse halt does not
stop given itself as an input so this is
what happens if we read the table in
this way now let's read it another way
because what we noticed here is that if
the program stops when it's given itself
as an input inverse halt on this program
should go into an infinite loop in other
words if we transfer what we did here to
down here we would have to write the
following so now let's compare those two
statements in this line here and here we
said inverse halt will go into an
infinite loop when given inverse halt
which is just itself as an input so you
have the same contradiction here as we
had any other proof and of course the
same thing is true down here so here we
said inverse halt does not stop given
itself as an input and here we said
inverse halt does stop would give it
itself so this table here is a nice way
to introduce the kind of logic crash
that we use in the proof by
contradiction because there's two ways
of constructing this table so the first
way is to construct it this way
basically meaning that we look at what
halt says either yes or no so we arrive
at the conclusion of what the program
does based on what hold has to say about
that program now the other way of
constructing this table is more or less
going this way so based on what hauled
will say that the program does we can
predict the behavior of inverse halt and
this construction works perfectly fine
so constructing it this way or this way
those are both compatible views with one
exception once we feed and verse hold
into this table these two logics crash
because the conclusions that we draw in
this way are exactly the opposite of the
conclusions that we draw in this way and
that is where the contradiction is
happening and actually constructing the
table this way or the
way is perfectly fine the only problem
is making the assumption that this halt
algorithm here actually exists what you
already know it doesn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
