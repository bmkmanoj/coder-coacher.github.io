we're gonna add for boosting here is
we're gonna we're going to expand on
this notion of hardest examples and
weighted mean but before I can do that
I'm gonna have to define a couple of
terms okay and you let me know Michael
if if these terms make sense so here's
the first one the first one is Error so
how we've been defining errors so far
usually we take the squared difference
between the correct labels and the
what's produced by our classifier or
regression algorithm ah that's true that
is how we've been using error when we're
thinking about regression error how
about a notion of accuracy about how
good we are at say classifying examples
so let's let's stick with classification
form um well so that would be the same
as squared error except that it's not
really needing the whole powers grid
error that is to say if we the outputs
are zeros and ones the squared error is
essentially just whether or not there's
a mismatch so it could just be the total
number of wrong answers right so what
we've been doing so far is counting
mismatches I like that word in this
matches and we might call an error rate
or an error percentage as the total
number of mismatches over the total
number of examples and that tells us
whether we're at 85 percent or 92
percent or whatever right so that's what
we've been doing so far but implicit in
that Michael is the idea that every
single example is equally as important
so that's not always the case now you
might remember from the very first talk
that we had we talked about
distributions over examples we said that
you know learning only happens if your
training set has the same distribution
as your future testing set and if it
doesn't then all bets are off and it's
very difficult to talk about induction
or learning that notion of distribution
is implicit in everything that we've
been doing so far and we haven't really
been taking it into account when we've
been talking about error so here's
another definition of error and you tell
me if you think it makes sense given
what we just said so this is my
definition of error so the subscript D
stands for distribution so we don't know
how new examples are being drawn but
however they're being drawn they're
being drawn from some distribution and
I'm just going to call that distribution
D okay mm-hm
right so H is our old friend the
hypothesis that's the specific
hypothesis that our learner has
output that's what we think is the true
concept and see is whatever the true
underlying concept is so I'm gonna
define error as the probability given
the underlying distribution that I will
disagree with the true concept on some
particular instance X does that make
sense to you yeah but I'm not seeing why
that's different from number of
mismatches in the sense that if we count
mismatches on a sample drawn from D
which is how we would get our testing
set anyway then I would think that'd be
you know if it's large enough a pretty
good approximation of this value so here
Michael let me give you a specific
example I'm gonna draw for four possible
values of X and when I say I'm gonna
draw four possible values of X I mean
I'm just gonna put four dots on the
screen okay and then I'm gonna tell you
that this particular learner output a
hypothesis output you know a potential
function that ends up getting the first
one and the third one right but gets the
second and the fourth one wrong so
what's the error here hmm so let's just
make sure that the that everybody's with
us let's do this as a quiz okay so let's
let's ask the students where they think
so here's the question again you've
output some hypothesis over the four
possible values of X and it turns out
that you get the first in the third one
right and you get the second and the
fourth one wrong but I look at it like
this what's the error rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
