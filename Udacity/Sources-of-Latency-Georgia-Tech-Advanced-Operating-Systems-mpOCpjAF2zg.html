quickly responding to an event think of
playing a video game and shooting at a
target you want the instant that you
shoot at the target for action to appear
on the screen now problem is there are
three sources of latency for
time-sensitive events in any typical
general purpose operating system the
first source of latency is what is
called the timer latency that is coming
because of the inaccuracy of the timing
mechanism for instance the timer event
went off at this point but the timer
interrupts actually happens only here
that is this is the event that should
have resulted in an interrupt but
because of the inaccuracy of the timer
there is a latency between the point at
which an event happened an external
event and the point at which the timer
goes off indicating the external event
and this is primarily coming up due to
the granularity of the timing mechanism
that's available in general purpose
operating systems for instance periodic
timers tend to have a 10 millisecond
granularity in Linux operating system so
that's the first source of inaccuracy or
latency for time-sensitive applications
the second source of latency is what we
call as the preemption latency and this
is because of the fact that the
interrupt could've happened when the
kernel was in the middle of doing
something from which it cannot be
preempted for instance the kernel is
modifying some critical data structure
in that case it may have turned off the
interrupt and therefore even though this
interrupt went off at this point the
kernel cannot be preempted until this
point that may be the second source of
latency or it could be that the kernel
itself is in the middle of handling
another higher priority interrupt and in
that case this timer interrupt is going
to be delayed so there's a second source
of latency for time-sensitive
applications running on commodity
operator
systems okay finally the timer interrupt
has been delivered to the system and now
the scheduler can actually schedule the
process that is waiting for this timer
interrupt so that that application can
take the appropriate action for this
external interrupt but wait there is
another higher priority task that's
already in the schedule askew and
therefore the app that was waiting for
this timer event cannot yet be scheduled
because of this higher priority task
that has dibs on the processor at this
point of time so this is the third
source of latency that is a scheduler
latency that is preventing this external
event from being delivered to the
application that is waiting for this
particular event now finally the high
priority app is done and therefore now
it is time for the app that is actually
waiting for this event so this is the
point of activation of the event app
that is the app that is waiting for this
timer event so you can see that this is
the distance ta to th the difference
between TA and th is event to activation
distance the event happened here but the
app that can react to this event only
gets scheduled at this point and this is
the latency that is coming in for
time-sensitive applications between the
actual event happening and the
activation of the app that has to deal
with that particular event for
time-sensitive applications to do well
it is extremely important that we shrink
the distance between event happening and
event activation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
