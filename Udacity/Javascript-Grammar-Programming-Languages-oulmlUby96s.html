languages if expressions like temp are
noun phrases then operators like
assignment are verbs and entire
statements like temp gets five our
sentences this whole thing together as a
statement it involves two expressions
temp and identifier five a number and an
operator the assignment operator so just
as I might write the english sentence j
becomes three perhaps it's a birthday
today i can write the javascript
assignment statement j becomes 3 j is
assigned the value 3 similarity between
the syntactic elements the subject verb
object and punctuation subject verb
object and punctuation identify our
operator expression semicolon is
relatively direct so now that we have an
intuition for statements let's add them
to our javascript formal grammar one of
the most common kinds of statements is
the assignment statement where we have
an identifier on the left hand side of
an equal side and then an arbitrary
expression on the right x becomes equal
to 5 another kind of statement is the
return statement at the end of absolute
value or Fibonacci or factorial are
almost any function or procedure we want
to return with the final value return an
arbitrary expression that becomes the
value of the function there are also
statements that influence what gets
executed in under which conditions
formally these statements are said to
refer to control flow because they guard
how execution flows through your
procedure the if statement checks to see
if a certain expression is true and if
it's true then we execute the then
branch there's also an if-then-else if
the expression is true the then branch
else the else branch I haven't said what
a compound statement is although since
we've seen JavaScript before we're going
to guess that it involves those curly
braces let's write it out right now so a
compound statement is an opening curly
brace a closing curly brace and some
statements ax in the middle and this is
a list of statements terminated by
semicolons I'm going to show you how
that works so here I've added a
recursive
rule statements can be one statement
followed by a semicolon followed by as
many more statements as you like or you
can decide that you're done and replace
it with nothing or if you like will draw
the epsilon there to mean the empty
string for the subset of JavaScript that
will be handling in this class this
grammar gives more details about what's
possible in addition to expressions we
have statements that build upon
expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
