together I simply added their
coefficients and then multiplied by the
variable they both contain to get 9x
since 3 plus 6 is nine and the variable
in both terms is X we can do the same
thing to deal with the Y terms over here
so negative 5y plus 9y is going to be
equal to whatever negative five plus
nine is x y we know that negative five
plus nine is equal to four so our answer
is 4 y and we can fill that in the box
over here in our original expression we
have four different terms and over here
we only have two terms this is why we
call this simplifying expressions this
expression is way more simple than the
one over here is remember that I was
allowed to put an equal sign here
between these two expressions because
they are exactly mathematically
equivalent in order to come up with the
expression over here I only played with
the terms inside of this expression I
didn't bring anything in from the
outside the only way I modified it was
by squishing together things that were
already there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
