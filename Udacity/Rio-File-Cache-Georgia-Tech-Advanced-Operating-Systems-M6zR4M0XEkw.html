implement our vm efficiently with a
battery back dram let's first understand
how we can use a battery back dram to
implement a persistent file cache what
we mean by that is typically file
systems use a file cache to hold data
that it has brought from the disk for
efficiency of manipulation by programs
running on the processor and when we say
it's a persistent file cache what we are
saying is even if there is power failure
the contents of the file cache is still
available when the power comes back up
again and in order to achieve that what
we're going to do is we're going to
string a UPS power supply to back this
file cache which is implemented in DRAM
so the contents of the file cache never
goes away and we're also postulate that
there is VM a virtual memory protection
that has been built in to the operating
system to prevent operating system
errors such as wild rights to the file
cache during software crash or power
failure now there are two ways to use
the Rio file cache one is when a process
does file rights actually they are
writing to the in-memory copy of the
file typically operating system buffer
the rights that you do to files in DRAM
and then write them out to the disk at
opportune moments later on and now if
these file rights go to this file cache
which is battery backed then you make
sure that these file rights are
persisted normally if an application
wants to make sure that when it writes a
file the contents of the file is
immediately forced to disk the
application would have to do an F sync
call in a unique system for instance but
if we have this battery backed file
cache the application can simply do
normal file rights and don't worry about
doing an F sync because writing to the
file rights to the file cache and the
file cache is persistent by definition
because it is battery backed and
similarly another common operation that
is done is unix allows files to be
mapped that is mapped into memory and if
an application Maps a file into memory
and rights to that file using normal
program writes those normal program
rights become persistent because these
rights are backed by the file cache and
the file cache is battery backed and
therefore normal program rights becomes
persistent also so with the real file
cache that is battery-backed what we get
is that file rights by a process as well
as normal program rights to memory
mapped files become persistent by
definition in the absence of this
facility of a persistent file cache if
an application were to em map of file
and write to that using normal program
rights then it will have to do what is
called an M sync call in order to make
sure that writes that it did to virtual
memory actually get persisted on the
disk but with a file cache Rio file
cache that is persistent there is no
need to do that because by definition we
are saying any rights that get into this
file cache will persist in other words
the conference's file cache will survive
power failures so if there is a system
crash whether it is a power failure or
software cash the file cache data in
memory is going to be written out to the
disk for recovery and so the upshot is
no synchronous rights are needed to the
disc anymore and also means that right
back up files written to by an
application can be arbitrarily delayed
what that means from the file system
perspective is that if the lifetime of
files is very short then those files go
away and so you don't have to write it
to the disk in the first place and this
is common in compilation process for
instance there are a number of temporary
files that are created and those files
live in the file cache for a short
amount of time and when the compilation
process is complete those files will be
deleted so you never have to write those
files to the disk so that's a good thing
about having this idea of a persistent
file cache now let's look at how we can
use real
Oh to implement our vm so we've got this
persistent file cache and we're going to
ask the question if we have this
persistent file cache how can we
optimize the implementation of a
reliable virtual memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
