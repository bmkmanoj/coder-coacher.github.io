measurements yeah I mean again and again
you see people look at the wrong thing
and I think it was common thing is when
people look at users and they don't
measure the number of users properly now
that that's true in a company that
should be generating revenue and is
looking at the number of users rather
than how much revenue those users are
generating right that happens a lot but
it's also true even with companies that
should just be looking at users when
they count user is wrong they'll say you
know we had 50,000 signups in the last
week right okay a sign up is not a user
how frequently are those users engaging
with your product so looking at patterns
of retention exactly I mean retentions
everything when you're looking at users
if you have people they sign up on day
one and they never come back it looks
terrible and it means you're building a
bad product something again that's a
mile wide
you know inch deep kind of thing because
no one really needs it if you have
something where you only have a thousand
users but they use it ten times a day
now you're on to something it might not
feel as good as having 50,000 signups
but it's so much better because it's the
base that you can grow from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
