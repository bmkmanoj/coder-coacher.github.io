iOS developer at double touch where we
make mobile oven apps I was originally
studying art and graphic design but I
really loved like math and science and
when I went to college I my parents were
like oh why don't you study something
with the engineering and my graphic
design teacher encouraged me to like
look into computer science so I took a
class since I've been here we've been
working on our in-app direct messaging
service where users at an event can
connect to people one on one without
having the barrier of not having their
contact information we use Xcode and
we've been writing everything in
objective-c you face a lot of different
problems including like view problems or
like API connection problems core data
core location and Bluetooth but first I
looked like at Apple Documents I'm like
what do I need to know before I start
coding something with core data and
it'll tell you like give you the
directions to get started if you're
having a problem you can just look it up
on the internet and someone is bound to
answered it or someone is also going to
be in the same boat as you
I think mobile programming is there's a
lot of fun because you can you can
immediately see it on your device or we
can immediately impact your friends or
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
