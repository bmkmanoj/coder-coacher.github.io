then why don't all women with this
mutation get breast cancer because I
mean didn't we learn in lesson 5 the
person is heterozygous for a dominant
gene then they will in fact be affected
by it that is exactly what we learned in
lesson 5 and that's not the case here
because the complex world of complex
traits is complex right some alleles it
turns out don't always cause a phenotype
because they're not what we call fully
penetrant so you're saying if you have a
disease-causing allele you might not
actually have that disease exactly
that's exactly what penetrant says
penetrance is the degree to which an
allele causes a given trait there are
lots of examples of dominant traits that
aren't actually fully penetrant how does
that happen well it's complicated as you
can imagine and it's usually because
there are multiple genes controlling any
given trait and although one allele of
one of those genes could have a
noticeable impact on the trait we may or
may not see it depending on what the
alleles are for all the other genes well
how do we figure out what all these
other alleles are well research long
laborious research for example some
research has shown us that the risk for
breast cancer jumps to 60% if you have
some types of these Braca one mutations
so do 60% of women who have breast
cancer have this mutation that's a
really good question but the answer is
actually no in fact very few women who
have breast cancer actually have these
mutations if we look back at our
original graph of breast cancer risk
where the average was 12% notice that a
risk of 60% is way to the right of that
and only a few women have that risk also
implying that even fewer women have this
particular mutation because it's not the
only contributor to breast cancer in
fact the prevalence of baraka one
mutations varies in different ethnic
populations of the world but in the
United States for the general population
the prevalence of brocco bomb mutations
affects less than 1% of the population</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
