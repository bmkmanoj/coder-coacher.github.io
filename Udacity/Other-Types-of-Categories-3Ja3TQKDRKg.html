which categories are best for visual
identification is a challenge for doing
this labeling so let's assume for a
moment that we're gonna have some set of
visual categories a question you might
ask is about how many of them are there
it's kind of a weird question to ask you
know how many types of things are there
but you know look we've got a finite
amount of gelatinous stuff between our
ears and there's this question of sort
of how many different labels do you deal
with so our Biederman psychologist and
does work in cognitive vision and mental
models for doing vision back in the in
the 80s he came up with this number of
about ten to thirty thousand okay now
big range but it's an interesting idea
because it's also related if you take a
look at the number of nouns people know
that is you could ask how many nouns do
you know well it's not gonna be two
million and it's not gonna be eleven at
least I hope if you're watching this
it's not eleven okay it's in the tens of
thousands of range okay so it gives you
some idea of sort of the scale of the
recognition problem there are by the way
other types of categories other than
just sort of natural categories so for
example you think about functional
categories so here's a set of chairs and
yes you can sit in all these things
although some of them look like they
would be kind of stunningly
uncomfortable but they don't really
share a visual property so you can
imagine that semantically in your head
you know that they have a certain
relationship but from a recognition
perspective it's not clear that the same
process that recognizes this as a chair
should also recognize that as a chair
another type of category which is valid
but not perceptual irrelevant might be
these sort of ad hoc categories of
things you find in an office environment
that's a perfectly natural category in
fact it's even a category which you can
think about probabilistic reasoning is
biasing things right if I tell you we
are in an office you're much more likely
to find a stapler right then to find a
horsewhip so maybe that would by use
your recognition but the notion of it
being a single visual category as you
can see from these objects doesn't make
a lot of sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
