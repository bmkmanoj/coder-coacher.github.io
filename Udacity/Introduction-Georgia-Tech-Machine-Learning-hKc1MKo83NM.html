going to talk about information theory
now information theory is not really a
machine learning algorithm so we will
try to first understand why we need to
learn information theory usually you
could teach a whole course on
information theory but for now it is
sufficient to know the basics so first
we will try to understand where
information theory is used in machine
learning so consider this to be any
machine learning algorithm for example
let this learner be a decision tree
learner now we have several inputs X 1 X
2 X 3 and one output for simplification
let's assume that this is a regression
problem that's why we have one output we
want to ask interesting questions like
how is X 1 related to Y X 2 related to Y
X related to Y why do you want to ask
such questions if you remember from our
id3 algorithm the first step is to find
out which input best splits our output
so we need to find out which of these X
1 X 2 or X 3 gives you the most
information about Y so we have to first
understand what the word information
information theory means in general
every input vector and output vector in
the machine learning context can be
considered as a probability density
function so information theory is a
mathematical framework which allows us
to compare these density functions so
that we can ask interesting questions
like are these input vectors similar if
they are not similar then how different
they are and so on we call this measure
as mutual information or we could ask if
this feature has any information at all
so we'll call this measure entropy so we
are going to find out what these terms
mean how they are related to machine
learning in general and we'll briefly
look at the history of this field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
