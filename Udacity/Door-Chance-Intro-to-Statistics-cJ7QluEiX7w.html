you probably don't know his name is
Monty Hall and starting in 1963 for many
years Monty Hall ran a game show called
let's make a deal in the center of the
gameshow was a puzzle that puzzles
statisticians to the present day so in
this unit which is optional in the
statistics class and let you solve the
Monty Hall problem you get a chance to
program it to verify that the solution
which is not obvious is actually correct
so here we go the essence of a game are
three doors behind one of those is a
beautiful car but Monty won't tell you
where the cars instead all the doors are
covered by curtains so the subject of
the game is as follows you get to place
a bet say you pick door tool and if
behind the bet you place you win the car
otherwise you win nothing so far so good
but here's the caveat obviously among
the two remaining doors maybe one that
doesn't contain the car someone T is
going to be mean it's going to show you
it's going to lift the curtain from one
of the other doors and there's clearly
no car after now closing the curtain
again he'll ask you do you want to
switch that is you want to change your
vote to the remaining curtain in the
hopes of having an increased chance of
winning the car the reason why this
problem is interesting is because when
Monty Hall lifted the curtain here II
didn't tell you anything you knew in
advance that one of the two curtains
wouldn't contain the car
so the me effect that he lifted the
curtain should give you zero information
relative to where among the winning
doors the cars so all you know now is
that door three doesn't contain the car
but why should door one now be more
likely than door - so here's the
question what are the probabilities of
the car B being behind - a 1 or 2 n 2 or
3 provided that the initial pick was
door 2 and Monty then lifts is 2 or 3 to
show it there's no car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
