to an actual car problem and the one
I'll be using is a bit simplified as
always but does relate to real-world
path planning as it's done for example
by Google Maps suppose we have a car
down here and this car now has a state
an X a Y and an orientation feeder
orientation for simplicity is chosen
from four possible directions up down
left and right
and as a quiz you in the beginning I
like to get to the location over here
facing left realize that now the state
space is 3-dimensional just like in our
localization example I now would like to
implement a dynamic programming planner
they gives me the optimal path for
getting from here to here and it lets me
play with cost functions so there's
three principal actions one is move in
which the car just goes one which self
forward in its present orientation it
doesn't turn at all that could be
applied anywhere in the maze in any
direction - turn left and then move so
this car when its position in the cell
over here could choose the turn left and
move which way it moves over here and
the last one is turn right and move in
which case it would from the silver here
turn over here and head in this
direction so here's our world again you
can see there's a street over here
that's navigable one over years
navigable you see the loop on the right
side and remember that now the state
space is 3-dimensional not
two-dimensional our goal is to move to
cell 2 comma 0 which is the one over
here our initial state is up here and
the initial state has not just the
position of 4/3 but also an orientation
0 so it's a 3 dimensional state and here
are my orientations 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
first some mixer will go up the second
go left third one go down and the first
one go right here the names associated
with it up left on and right and this
thing here is interesting
as actions we have three actions we can
add to the index orientation - 1 0 or 1
if we add minus 1 we jump one up in the
cyclic array over here which is the same
as doing a right turn so for example if
you go from go left
to go up that's the same as turning
right if we add +1 that's the same as
turning left if we leave the orientation
unchanged then we go straight which is
indicated by this hash symbol over here
these actions can be different costs
right now the left turn cost me 2 going
straight costs me 1 and going right cost
me one as well which as we all know
makes the left turn the preferred
solution over here and indeed as I run
it you can see how the car turns left
over here for the collocation if I were
to increase the cost for the left action
to 20 then my solution changes you can
see the car dashes straight ahead over
here turns right over here right over
here right over here and then goes
straight to the goal location that
software I want you to implement so
there's one more hint the value function
itself is three dimensional and here's
the code that I've been using unless it
is the most efficient but has inside
four identical erasers as the grid
concatenated into a mega grid and they
initialize all by a very large value 999
in this case so you need the error
structures just like these and it turns
out this makes it more difficult to
write the code this is our last quiz in
this lecture
our last programming assignment and you
might spend some time it took me a while
to program it myself
to get an output just like this over
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
