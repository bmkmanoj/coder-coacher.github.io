that the only thing is really missing is
the measurement probe function and
that's a little bit more involved
because I have to really compare what
the exact measurement would be for any
of robot particle and what I sensed and
compute the probability correspondence
between the correct measurements and
what I sensed over here to do this I
calculate predict the measurements using
the sense function here comes a little
flag that I defined if I set it to zero
then the sense function acts noise-free
which is what I want
there could be the measurement model but
even if you left this out you're going
to get a finance on my opinion but that
makes a little bit more accurate so that
allows me to compute the exact bearings
of the landmarks for my particle and
then I can compare these correct
bearings called predicted measurements
with the ones I received now do this
down here in the computer errors routine
where I go through each measurement and
in two steps I calculate the error in
bearing first it's the absolute
difference between my measurement that
are observed minus the predicted
measurement and there's an eye at the
end over here let's see if you can see
this right there and this difference
might fall outside minus pi plus pi so
this line over here just brings it back
to the smallest possible value in the
cyclic space of zero to 2pi so I'm
adding PI at a more load to but times pi
and in our subtract PI again so this
gives me a value between minus PI and
plus PI I then plug this error bearing
into a Gaussian and here's my Gaussian
where X where it I divided by my bearing
noise squared compute the exponential
and here's my normalizer that's strictly
speaking of don't really need for the
implementation I can safely omit it
because weights are self normalized but
left it in so it's actually really a
Gaussian and I take this Gaussian value
and multiply it up into my error
function so for each of the measurements
I multiply in one motion and the final
Gaussian is my importance way that I
returned in this function over here so
this is not easy to implement I hope you
got it right scrolling further down on
my coat I know implement the particle
fit as follows its use a thousand
particles and this is exactly the same
routine we had before
we generate our initial particles he has
said the noise for these particles to be
bearing noise steering noise and
distance noise I don't comment out the
measurement generation step I just take
the input and then as I've go further
down I just run my particle theta this
is the exact same code you're familiar
with there's a motion update there's a
measurement update and there's a V
sampling step over here all those are
the same as before and in the very end I
just print the result of get position so
if I do this for my example here's the
position I get and I guess I forgot to
uncomment the robot coordinate over here
but if you look at the values over here
seven point zero is about the same as
849 is about the same is 48 in for point
three one is about the same as pop front
three five so this particle filter
clearly does a pretty good job in
estimating the forward position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
