our variables x and y are related in
this equation we've developed for the
total weight of the suitcase depending
on the number of glasses wiper sets that
grant puts in it I think that the next
step to further understand the
relationship here is to graph our
equation now I know that I've done some
graphing for the class already on the
tablet but since I really want to
encourage you to graph on physical
actual graph paper I'm going to just
show you a demo of how I do that just to
make sure that you've got the basics for
setting up a graph and drawing a line
totally down so I clearly have to switch
pens since this one doesn't write on
actual paper materials that are
important for graphing include graphing
paper which is just paper with lines on
it that create a grid a ruler like this
lovely one right here and a pencil I'm
super picky about using pencils and not
pens for graphing I think it's really
important so you can make sure that you
can fix any mistakes that you've made by
erasing the XY table what we created
earlier is going to be really useful for
helping us graph points but before we
can graph those points we need to set up
our coordinate plane it's we need to
draw a set of axes we can plot these
points on so I started by lining the
ruler up with one of the vertical lines
on the sheet of paper over the left-hand
side since all the values that we need
to graph in this graph are both positive
in x and y sometimes this won't be the
case I need to think about where to put
your axes and how far to draw out the x
axis in both directions in the Y axes in
both directions that you can fit all the
important points on your graph but for
now I've drawn a y-axis and I line up
the ruler horizontally you can notice
that it's positioned quite towards the
bottom of the y axis that I've drawn
since I don't really need any negative Y
values for this and once I've got the
ruler situated properly in relation to
this horizontal line right here I can
draw my x-axis wonderful sky but Y axis
in an x-axis what's missing right now is
some arrows we know that the y axis and
the x axis both extend infinitely in
both directions they both go from
negative infinity to positive infinity I
also like to label the origin with a
zero and they label each axis as well
with the variable that it corresponds to
great now I have some axes however let's
look at what numbers we actually need to
plot need to plot from 0 to 50 in X and
from 7 to 32 and why we've got zero laid
out that's great
but to go all the way to 50 I clearly
can't have each one of these boxes stand
for one on the x-axis or on the y-axis
either so you need to make a scale since
I have quite a few boxes here and I'm
only graphing six points I'm going to
make every grid length on the x-axis
stand for five and just for simplicity
I'll label every two grids with a 10 so
10 20 and so on and so forth
I can do the same thing or a similar
thing for the y-axis here I only need to
go up to 32 though so I can probably
space my numbers out a little bit more
I've labeled my y-axis that every to
grid lengths stands for 5 and of course
I've labeled it all the way up now that
we have our axes properly set up we can
actually start graphing points this is
sort of a tricky example to start with
so I'm sort of glad that I picked it
because you'll notice that since there
are numbers that end in 7 and in 2 on
the y-values these aren't going to
correspond exactly to good lengths here
this is a great chance to see that
sometimes in your graphing you don't
have points that end up exactly where
lines on the grid cross you have to just
be very careful and estimate as closely
as you possibly can to remind us of the
coordinate or ordered pair notation that
we'll often see when we're moving to
graphs
I've written all the data in the table
here in point notation okay
let's actually graph first point zero 7
so we start at 0 on the x axis and move
up 7 in Y the point halfway between 5
and 10 is 7 and a half so we're going to
be right below that and I'll put a point
right there we have 10 12 so you go to
10 in the X and 12 which will be just
below this line right here which is 12
and 1/2 and we continue just like this
hmm something looks kind of funny to me
let's check with a ruler to see if all
these points lie on a single straight
line clearly this one doesn't so I must
have done something wrong it's really
really easy when you're graphing to when
you move over on the x axis and then up
to your y-coordinate accidentally switch
your hand position horizontally and not
do a graphing the wrong point this is
why we just need to check our work very
carefully okay so that was the point 40
27 so I'll just graph that one again 40
very carefully following this line up to
the 27 that looks better than the other
point so you can see I must have just
shifted my hand to the right when I was
graphing ok now that I have all of my
points
let's make a line through them rulers
are really helpful but you also have to
make sure that you're using them as best
you can I like to put the point of my
pencil on a point and then line the
ruler up with the pencil tip to make
sure that the ruler is actually going to
be in line with the points I can do the
same thing with the last point I'm going
to graph and now I actually connect the
points get a beautiful line wonderful
now since conceivably grant could pack
more than 50 pairs of glasses wipers in
his suitcase I'm going to draw an arrow
on the end of the line right here this
indicates that the graph could continue
increasing in the x-direction and in
this case the y-direction as well passed
this last point that we graphed I'm not
gonna put one over on this end though
because for the purposes of the data
we're dealing with we're not going to
have negative x-values grant can't pack
a negative number of glass fibers in his
bag this would be very different though
if we're graphing other kinds of
equations that don't necessarily
correspond to things that can't have
negative quantities so with most graphs
you'll see an arrow on the other end of
the line as well we'll see that in later
