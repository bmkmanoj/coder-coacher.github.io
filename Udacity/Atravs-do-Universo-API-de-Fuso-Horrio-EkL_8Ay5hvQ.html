a bit and talk about a very specific but
useful feature of the Google Maps API
here at Google we have offices all over
the world from New York to London to
India to China to Sydney
just yesterday I scheduled a meeting
with my teammate in Japan what if you
wanted a quick way to find out what time
zone you're in based on the location
that would be really useful
luckily the Google Maps API includes the
time zone API web service this feature
is pretty simple you can pass in a
location in the form of a lot long and a
date/time stamp which tells the service
whether or not to adjust for daylight
savings and the service will give you
back a time zone based on that
coordinate it'll also tell you whether
or not that time zone is currently
offset due to daylight savings time and
the offset of that time zone from UTC
which stands for coordinated Universal
Time don't ask me why it's UTC and not C
ut maybe they didn't want to name it cut
let's do a quick example of the time
zone API I'm gonna make a quick time
zone API request notice the same
namespace again I'm gonna request the
response in JSON format and I'm gonna
make the request for this specific lat
long I'm passing in the time stamp in
seconds which you can usually find
converters online for or in your code
you can use the JavaScript date now
function and I'm passing in my API key
turns out this is in Japan standard time
we see that there's currently no offset
for daylight savings time here and that
the offset from UTC is thirty two
thousand four hundred seconds which is
nine hours yep totally just did that in
my head
incidentally this location is actually
tashirojima in Japan better known as cat
island where there are more cats than
humans let's take a quiz meow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
