when you want to talk about Mac or
multi-level security and we even said
well user has a certain label file has
another label and we have to say we have
to check if user with this label l1
should he or she be able to access the
document that has label l2 so so we have
to sort of compare these labels so here
we're going to explore you know how that
comparison might work so let's just talk
about labels of the type that we
discussed in the context of the military
intelligence community and and how they
access information so sensitivity how
sensitive data is we said that we had
those you know circles top secret is the
most sensitive secret next level then
classified and unclassified we had
restricted in the middle there but I'm
just speaking these four examples so
what does this greater than mean so we
are saying that tops these are these
levels are actually ordered totally and
by total order what we mean here is that
if I pick any two of these I can tell
you which one is more sensitive than the
other one so TS is the most sensitive if
you took the s and any other of these
levels then we we know that this is
higher or is greater than the other
level similarly secret is greater or
higher than classified so this greater
really means it's higher level of
sensitivity and total order basically
means when you pick any pair relations
and various kind of orders that you can
define for the elements that are in in
in in a given set that's what defines a
relation so the total here means you
pick any two elements of this set and
there is an order between them so one is
always going to be more sensitive than
the other one and here we see that
through this greater than sign that we
have symbol that we have we do know that
labels have a level sensitivity level
but they also have a compartment and we
said compartments are sort of sets of
different topics or categories and how
do you compare sets you know you take it
take a set s1 and s2 s1 maybe
contained in s2 s2 maybe contain an s-1
or neither's hat maybe contend another
one ok so I've said s1 had some elements
that as two dozen and vice versa then
neither set will be contained in that so
when when you have sets the way you
compare them is you know containment or
subset or you know is one subset of
another one and we know that that order
is a partial order okay so total order
is when pick any two and you know one
always is you know greater than or
higher than the other when you talk
about sets we know there are going to be
said you know pairs of sets where
neither one contains the other one and
they're not going to be ordered so
that's called partial order so and we'll
explore this a little bit more through
examples but if a label is going to have
these two parts one part is totally
ordered one part is ordered sometimes
and not comparable at other time so
that's the partial order so when we talk
about actually ordering labels we had to
look into the label we have to look into
the sensitivity level and what are the
sensitivity levels of EP the labels that
we are comparing is l1 and l2 then we
are to look at elwin sensitivity level
and l2's sensitivity level and how they
compare and then you have to look at the
compartment of each one of those and
then compare those compartments and by
comparing both parts then we going to be
able to decide you know how to order the
labels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
