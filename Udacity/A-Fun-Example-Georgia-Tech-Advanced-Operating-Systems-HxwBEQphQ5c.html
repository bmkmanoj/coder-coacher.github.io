this is me and I'm going to India for
Christmas holidays and I'm going to make
an airline reservation i'm going to use
expedia to make the airline reservation
so what i'm doing on my computer i'm
sending a message to Expedia saying hey
make a reservation for me and expedia
chooses to make the reservation using
delta so it sends a message a doobie is
a message that i sent to Expedia saying
I need a ticket to go to India
preferences and so on expedia then sends
a message to delta booking the
reservation that I want Delta confirms
by this message e to f that yes
kishore's reservation is in and once
expedia has received this confirmation
from delta it sends me a message g2h and
this message is telling me that I've got
the airline reservation booked so all of
these are messages a to be is a message
is the sending of the message be the
receipt of the message and see the
sending of the message from expedia to
delta is the confirmation that my
reservation is in from delta to Expedia
and finally g2h is the message from
expedia to me saying that yes you have
your reservation you can go to India at
December that's good and then what I'm
doing is I'm directly contacting Delta
message from me to Delta asking for my
preference for food fortunately it's an
international trip so I'm going to get a
little bit more than peanuts on on the
Delta flight to India so I send a
message asking for my meal preference
and Delta confirms that yes you have
your meal preference that's the message
k2l is a message that confirms that I
have a meal preference and all set so
everything that I described here is what
you probably do on a routine basis every
time you make any travel plans either
contacting Expedia or some other the
portal to make your airline reservation
all of this makes logical sense right
there are set of beliefs that are
ingrained in this picture here about the
ordering of events in the distributed
system that makes all of this work in
particular when we look at the set of
events that you are seeing
here as events that I'm responsible for
we think that these events are happening
in sequential order so for instance if
you look at what expedia is doing it is
receiving my message saying that I want
an airline reservation to be made
there's a bunch of bookkeeping then
sends this message over the Delta saying
that well go ahead and make this booking
for him gets the acknowledgement back
from Delta and then it does a bunch of
other bookkeeping once it gets the
acknowledgement from him from Delta and
then it tells me that okay you've got it
and after that it does some more
bookkeeping to say that well you know he
shows booking is done and I'm going to
make some internal notes on the details
of this booking and so those are all
things that are happening as events
within expedia so the beliefs that we
have is that processes are sequential
that is the events that we see happening
in a given process these are the events
that are happening in a given process we
expect these events to be totally
ordered right so for instance you
wouldn't expect given this ordering of
events that you see an Expedia's profile
that this event em happened before
sending this message see right so that's
the mental model that you have that
events are totally ordered within the
single process and that's why we're
calling process sequential that is the
execution of the process is the textual
order that you see at least the apparent
effect of the execution of the process
that you as user experience is
sequential so if I look at this
particular process H happens before I F
happens before G and D happens before E
so all of these are things that are
ingrained in our mental model of
processes being sequential the other
belief is that you cannot have a receipt
of a message before the sender is
complete right so you have to send the
message before it can be received or in
other words the receipt of a message
which is be here has to happen after the
message is being sent from here
similarly this message reception f must
have happened after the message was sent
from Delta so those are the
or beliefs that we have about what is
happening with events in a distributed
system that events within the process a
sequential and across processes when you
have communication events send happens
before receive so these are two gore
beliefs that we have about the working
of a distributed system and we call
these beliefs as they happened before
