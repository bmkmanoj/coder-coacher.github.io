just the number three and we can get
three from expression by following this
rule starting from expression replacing
with number and then replacing number
with the number three the second one is
not valid and the way to see that is if
we start from expression we only have
three choices we can replace it with
expression operator expression we can
replace it with number or you can
replace it with the left paren
expression right paren since the
expression we're trying to match starts
with a left paren the only way to get
our left paren is to eventually have
this rule that replaces expression with
left paren when we use that rule what we
get is the left paren followed by
expression now we have expression here
from here we've matched the far left
paren and the far right paren what we
have left is this we can replace this
expression with paren expression and we
have paren that's replacing this
expression using this rule and then we
still have the second right paren that
we had before this isn't going to match
here because we need to write parens to
match and the essence of this rule is
that every time we open a parenthesis we
have to eventually close it so we can't
produce expressions where the
parentheses aren't balanced so this is
not a valid Python expression we can't
produce the third one this has many
nested expressions we have three parens
that are open but we have balancing
closed parens and the way we could
derive this expression we'll start with
one expression that's our starting point
we use this rule to replace it with
paren expression paren now we have an
expression that starts with a 1 so we
want to replace this expression with
expression operator expression we still
have the outer parens that we had before
now we're working on this part we want
to replace this expression with a number
and then with the number 1 we're going
to replace the OP following the operator
goes 2 times rule that's going to be
replaced with times and now we've got to
replace this expression we're trying to
produce this whole thing so we're going
to replace this with using the
parentheses and we can keep going we're
going to replace this expression
with expression operator expression
eventually get the two times and then do
that replacement with friends again to
get the three times four I'm not going
to fill in all the steps here because
they won't fit on the screen but I hope
you get the basic idea that we can keep
doing those replacements making complex
expressions like this one so the fourth
possibility is not a valid expression
there's no way that we can get an
operator in front with this rule there
are actually are rules in Python that
allow us to have an expression go to
operator expression but we have two
expressions here if there's a three
space three if it was just the number 33
this would actually be a valid Python
expression not something that we can
produce with this grammar though and the
fourth one is valid it's not sensible
are necessary to have a nested
parentheses like this but we can always
keep using this role so we can derive
that expression starting from expression
using the last rule with the parens
we're going to end up with paren
expression paren close paren we're going
to use that rule again we're going to
replace the middle expression with
expression paren expression replacing
this expression with the last rule that
will give us expression surrounded by
parens and we still have the two outer
parens on each side so we can have as
many nested parens as we want it's not
necessary it doesn't make a lot of sense
we would never actually want to write
code that way but it's still a valid
Python expression so recursive grammar
rules like these are very powerful we
only need a few simple rules to describe
a big language and the whole Python
language that we're going to learn in
this course can be described this way
we're not going to describe the entire
Python language this way but what I hope
is that you have a good sense for how
grammars work and you can see that even
as we introduce constructs somewhat more
informally as we go on that they could
be broken down into these kinds of
formal replacement rules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
