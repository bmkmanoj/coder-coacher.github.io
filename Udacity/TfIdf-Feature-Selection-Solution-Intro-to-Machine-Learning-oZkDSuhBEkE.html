shrink down the size of my vocabulary
and it will use it based on the number
of documents that a particular word
occurs in so if there's a word that
occurs in more than 50% of the documents
this argument says don't use it in the
tf-idf because it probably doesn't
contain a lot of information in it
because it's so common so this is an
example of another place where you can
do some feature reduction some
dimensionality reduction as we also call
it but of course you also always have
your old standby of doing something like
select percentile so I hope what you've
found in that coding exercise
underscores this point that we're
talking about right now that features
are not the same as information you just
got rid of 90% of your text features but
your classifier accuracy basically
didn't suffer at all and in fact in some
ways the performance improved because
it's able to run so much more quickly on
the smaller number of features so this
obviously is gonna be something that you
want to be keeping in mind especially
when you're working with very high
dimensionality data data that has lots
and lots of features you want to be
skeptical of all of those features and
think which are the ones that are really
going to get me the most bang for my
buck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
