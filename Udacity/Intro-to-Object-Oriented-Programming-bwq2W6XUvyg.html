programming class I was really excited
but then the instructor started to use
vocabulary that was somewhat strange to
me I felt intimidated and almost quit
perhaps you know that feeling in this
class we will do things differently here
we will build six projects together and
my hope is that you would want to share
these projects with your friends the
first of these is called project take a
break can you think of a friend who
works really long hours on a computer we
will write a program that keeps track of
time and after every 2 hours of work on
the computer the program prompts your
friend to take a break another one is
called project movies here we will learn
how to make an awesome website that
lists your favorite movies and shows
their trailers
now while making these and other
projects we will learn a programming
technique called object-oriented
programming this is used by software
engineers on a regular basis to reuse
and share code amongst each other above
all we will make sure that you make
challenging projects while feeling
comfortable with the learning curve so
if any of this seems interesting I
invite you to enroll now I'll see you in
class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
