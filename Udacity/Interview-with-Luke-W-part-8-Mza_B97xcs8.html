from direct manipulation screens that is
things you touch to provide input versus
what we have in the desktop and laptop
world is that the human body all of a
sudden really starts to matter before
when we're building software for
desktops and laptops the size of our
hands the size of our fingers what's a
comfortable reach a that burden is taken
on by the keyboards and the mice right
so as long as the mouse is comfortable
and the keyboard is comfortable the
software designer doesn't have to worry
about it they don't have to think about
these ergonomic considerations as soon
as software is something that people can
touch and feel the screen has to be
considered in the context of your hand
how far can you reach that thumb how big
is that thumb these things impact where
you put controls how large you make
controls and how easily those controls
are to manipulate anyone who's struggled
with a desktop form on a mobile device
knows these teeny little checkboxes and
radio buttons can be super frustrating
especially if you're trying to pick a
specific one so at the very least we
need to consider how to size controls
how to space them and that's sort of the
bare minimum if you want to do one
better then you start thinking about
well is it possible to create this flow
or to complete this flow using what I
call one thumb one eyeball and once
thumb one eyeball actually illustrate
this here since I have a phone like all
of you tube in your pocket kind of hold
it like this and you look at it like
this TV may be on you may be outside or
something like this how can I get
something done just with these sorts of
actions and that goes much broader than
just sighs right it's where you place
the controls its what the flow looks
like it's the kind of controls you use
as well and we have a lot of controls
that require the precision of a mouse
cursor to use well little like spinner
wheels that you find on the desktop
drop-down menus that you find on the
desktop all those controls need to be
rethought for touchscreens so that they
can actually be used by our hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
