with sentences which have to verbs in it
so here are two verbs told and throw
Maria told Ben to throw the ball how
might an AI agent make sense or this
particular sentence so once again the
processing starts on the left Maria is
not a verb so that's put in a concept
list and for the time being ignored the
processing goes through the second word
which is told which is a word and so the
primitive action correspond you told
this product the primitive action is
speak and so now we can start putting in
the fillers for the various slots so the
agent is Maria and the result is now we
go to the second one here the primitive
action is propel because we have a throw
here and the propulsion is being done by
Ben and the object is ball and now we
relate these to the second frame is a
result of the first frames action so if
we go back to the previous sentence a
shock enjoyed eating a frog we can see
how we can represent both verbs they are
in terms of action frames so Ashok
enjoyed that might be the frame here the
primitive action is feel the agent is
Ashok Ashok ate a frog does the
primitive action of ingest agent is a
shook and the update that got eaten was
frog and the result of that is this
frame where a shock had a feeling of
enjoyment note that some problems still
remain it is still difficult to figure
out exactly how to represent a sentence
like Ashok enjoyed eating a frog they
can be two representations for that
particular sentences in terms of to
action frames or one action frame and
one state change frame some of these
questions will get answered when we stop
thinking in terms of stories at only one
sentence long where stories that have a
number of sentences stories based on a
discourse because some of these
ambiguities will get resolved when we
know more about what happened with Ashok
enjoyed eating the Frog what came before
it or what came after it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
