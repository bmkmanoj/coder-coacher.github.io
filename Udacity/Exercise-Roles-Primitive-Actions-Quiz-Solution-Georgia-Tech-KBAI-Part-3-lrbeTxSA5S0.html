primitive for this sentence I chose as I
did before
move possession as the best primitive I
think it captures the high level meaning
of the sentence which is that we're
actually talking about a transfer of
ownership of the book from Mary to John
even if only temporary it might be
tempting to think of move object as
feeling as primitive and indeed it's
hard to picture John taking the book
from Mary without moving an object but
move object doesn't capture the highest
level meaning of this sentence John
could move Mary's book without actually
taking it from her so instead move
possession is probably the best way to
capture a high level meaning of the
sentence given that primitive we can go
back to the rule that Ashok was
mentioning earlier which is if we have a
animate agent immediately before the
verb we can infer that that agent is the
one executing the action so John here is
the agent doing the move possession
action similarly we can say that if
there's an inanimate object immediately
after the verb in the sentence then we
can probably infer that that's the
object that is actually being taken so
book becomes the object now if we recall
way back in the previous lesson our list
of the way that different prepositions
constrain the meaning of a sentence we
can remember that from usually indicates
that the word that immediately follows
it is the source for some action here we
have a slot titled source so we're
looking for a source we have a
preposition that indicates to what
follows is a source so we can for that
Mary is the source from which John gets
the book that's good David notice our
lexical syntactic and semantic analysis
all coming together here
the driver is semantic analysis the dry
word is this frame which captures the
semantics of this particular sentence
that allows us to draw inferences about
it that's why we used in term semantics
here so the semantics has been captured
by this frame with terms of all of these
slots but how do we decide on the
fillers well that requires lexical
analysis on syntactic analysis so when
we have the word John here John is a
concept and that concept is in animate
and that information is coming from a
lexicon that is the lexical analysis and
when we have a sentence like John - the
book from Mary and from is a preposition
and Mary follows immediately after that
this is capturing part of the syntax or
this particular sentence that is how we
derive that this source must be married
so the semantics lexical syntactic
analysis are all working together here
notice also how frames and rules are
coming together here
we've seen how frames help us understand
the meaning of the stories and that is
being done part by the rules that are
buried inside the slots so there is a
rule here which tells us how to extract
the agent from the sentence and put it
inside the slot similarly there's a
particular rule here in a rule here and
each one of these slots may have its own
rule of course that is sentences become
complex and these frames become complex
these rules will become much more
complex and someday there'll be multiple
rules here and multiple rules here and
this can become very complex very soon
another point you notice here is that
this is caffeine this semantics is like
I said earlier and how do we know that
because I can ask questions who has the
book who had the book what did John take
from Mary and you can answer all of
these questions using this frame once
you have this frame question answering
becomes possible common-sense reasoning
becomes possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
