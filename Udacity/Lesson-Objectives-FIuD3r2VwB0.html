you to learn about what is dynamic range
we will specifically talk about dynamic
range as a concept that applies to
images and how we want to be able to
capture real scenes with the lighting in
there you do metric information off the
scene to capture the best possible image
will also think about what makes or
prevents a camera to be able to capture
dynamic range correctly specifically
talking about digital cameras and how
they encode information or do not encode
the information of dynamic range of an
image we will talk about the image
acquisition pipeline which is aimed at
capturing the scene brightness the scene
radians and basically convert them to
pixel values and of course those are the
pixel values we can do various types of
mathematics on to generate newer types
of images we will look at the variety of
linear and nonlinear aspects that are
inherent in an image acquisition
pipeline that will allow us to start
thinking about what kind of mapping we
want to model and build upon in this
lesson we will also cover aspects of
camera calibration that will allow us to
calibrate a camera so we can actually be
able to get the right kinds of levels of
images and colors that are actually
visible in the scene into a real image
so the goal here is to calibrate a
camera so we would be able to look at
the exact colors in the scene and be
able to capture all of those to
replicate them in an image we will then
discuss how we can take values the pixel
values of intensities from different
exposures of an image again this is
where a camera comes in how will use the
exposure you know remember things like
aperture and shutter do then actually
capture the light information and then
use that generate a new image at the
scene and then we'll talk about tone
mapping which is aimed at taking a high
dynamic range image and then converting
it in a form that would be made visible
on a traditional display or perhaps even
print it out so you can actually see all
of the different types of dynamic range
in that image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
