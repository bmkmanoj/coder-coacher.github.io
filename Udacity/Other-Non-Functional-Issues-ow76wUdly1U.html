we may be alluded to but that also play
a role in dealing with these distributed
heterogeneous applications include fault
tolerance how does the system deal with
let's say exceptions that arise
flexibility how to support change in any
of the components in general you want to
be able to support reuse and what that
means is can you take some of the pieces
the components and use them in related
applications thereby improving your
productivity in general these
applications can get quite complex and
they're often mission-critical so you
need to be able to manage that
complexity and fifth is quality of
service and quality of service or qos
isn't is a concept whose goal is to be
able to specifically measure the
non-functional constraints and the
extent to which the system deals with
those with performance that's easy you
can you can measure things like response
time or throughput but some of the other
non-functional considerations are harder
to get a number around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
