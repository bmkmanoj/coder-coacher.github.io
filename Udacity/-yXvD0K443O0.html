time using the computer so I created a
new Python file and called it Mindstorms
pi you could have called it something
else and then inside it I created a
function called draw square which for
now is empty now I know there is this
module in Python called
turtle this is the actual thing that
moves around and draw stuff on the
computer by the way I encourage you to
find out why this thing is called turtle
and not a dog or a cat one way to start
the draw is by saying turtle dot turtle
now the syntax is a little weird and we
will understand it by the end of this
video but it suffices to say that this
is how we grab a turtle I will call it
Brad now the first thing we want to do
is move Brad forward and we can use the
forward function for that this function
takes in a number which is the distance
we want to move forward now I just want
to run this code and see if it's even
working but you know what the one thing
we forgot is that we still don't have a
screen on which this turtle aka Brad is
going to move around in other words we
need the red carpet equivalent in our
program I know that is done by adding a
window screen and this window is going
to have a red background and I want to
be able to close this window anytime I
click on it now let's save and run this
program
alright it seems that we have a window
with a red background and a turtle named
Brad which has moved 100 steps forward
okay so I am back at the code and now
I'm going to finish making the square so
after Brad has moved a hundred steps
forward I want to turn it right and I
want to do so by 90 degrees so I can say
Brad dot right 90 and because I want to
do these two steps right here four times
to draw a square I'll just copy place
them a few times so I'm going to copy
these two lines and I'm going to paste
them second time third time for time let
me save and run
all right it seems like we have our
first square</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
