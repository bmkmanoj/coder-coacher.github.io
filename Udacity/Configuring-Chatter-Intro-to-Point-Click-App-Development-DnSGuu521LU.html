a huge fan of this little search box oh
man life before that search box was
really rough who wants to navigate all
this nonsense arrows and business all
right so chatter chatter mobile new is
that we're doing no under bill to
chatter and then feed tracking okay okay
so just to give you a brief synopsis of
what we're looking at this is showing
you all the different objects you have
within your org both the standard
objects that are included and the stuff
we've created now what we want to do is
we want to enable our stage object for
feed tracking so that people can
collaborate on a stage record okay and
so what this means enable for feed
tracking means it's going to put a
chatter feed at the top of our stage
record for people to either follow the
record if they want to or just you know
make posts on this record okay so we
want to look for the stage object over
here stage okay yep and so if we enable
this four feet tracking huh we can also
select whatever fields we want to show
up in the feed if they were to change
like for example if we chose the stage
manager field if we check the stage
manager field whenever the stage manager
gets changed or reassigned that's going
to automatically post to the chatter
feed hey the stage managers change from
blah to blah okay so i don't know let's
follow the stage manager and if the size
of the stage changes you'd want to know
yeah i don't really think anything else
would change enough to need it that
looks good to me and then just click
Save so you can configure this for any
of the objects in your organization if
you say just want to get updated or
collaborate on any of your custom schema
mmhmm yeah ok so we've enabled chatter
what can I do you know go back to stage
yeah let's go back to the stage record</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
