the programming model looks like now
what you need to know is what's the GPU
good at how is it going to be good at
running programs all right in this
programming model so what is the GPU
good at for now let me just tell you two
things and keep these in mind as you're
planning your program thing number one
it is really good at efficiently
launching lots of threads you may be
used to other programming environments
we're launching threads is an expensive
process that is not the case here
in fact as we'll discuss later if you're
not launching lots of threads you're not
using the GPU effectively Dave my
co-instructor likes to say that the GPU
doesn't even get out of bed in the
morning for fewer than a thousand
threads the second thing that a GPU is
good at is actually running lots of
those threads in parallel all at the
same time ok so now we're going to
consider a simple example we're going to
take an input array of 64 floating-point
numbers numbered 0 to 63 and we're going
to square each number in the array so
the output will be 0 1 4 9 and so on
we're going to do this in three steps
we're going to start by looking at how
we'd run this code on the CPU then we'll
talk about how we'd run this on the GPU
without looking at code instead just
discussing what our code would do then
we'll dive into what the code actually
looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
