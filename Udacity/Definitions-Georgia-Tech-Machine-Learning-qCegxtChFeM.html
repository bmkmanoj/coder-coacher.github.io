talking about three different kinds of
ways of choosing the inputs to the
learner okay so what were they again we
just looked at two of them so the
learner chooses examples the teacher
hopefully a nice one chooses examples
and then there was the case with the
examples are given to us by nature and I
guess there was a fourth one which is
that a mean teacher gives it to us but
you know I don't think that's all that
interesting I tend to think of nature as
a mean teacher well not only that but in
the at least in the mistake bound
setting that we just looked at again the
the learner was robust against any
choice of where the inputs were coming
from so a mean teacher it would have it
would have done just as well because one
fourth it doesn't matter when it makes
its mistakes it's only gonna make a
fixed number them no matter what okay so
we kind of dealt with three of these but
we haven't really talked about the the
nature chooses case yet and that's in
some ways the most interesting and
relevant and in other ways the most
complicated because you have to really
take into consideration this space of
possible distributions I think now with
though we're in a pretty good situation
in terms of being able to define some
important terms and we're gonna use
those terms to get a handle on this
question of what happens when nature
chooses okay that seems reasonable
so computational complexity we talked
about the the how much computational
effort is going to be needed for a
learner to converge to the answer sample
complexity in the case of a batch that
is to say we have a training set is how
large is that training set need to be
for the learner to be able to create
successful hypotheses and that's in the
batch setting and them in the online
setting we have this notion of a mistake
bound how many misclassifications can
the learner make over an infinite run
may I ask you a question you said
something I thought pretty interesting
how much computational complexity you
said how much computational effort is
needed for a learner to converge to the
right answer is that the is that a
requirement when you talk about
computational complexity or is it just
that you need to know how much
computational effort is needed for a
learner to converge to something well so
if it's converging to something and we
don't care what it's converging to then
it's really easy to have a algorithm
with low computational complexity right
it's just like return garbage its runs
in constant time mm-hmm
so yeah it's
it's in the context of actually solving
the problem that computational
complexity is most interesting well I
was gonna say what if a set of
hypotheses I'm willing to entertain
doesn't include the true concept ah good
right so in some sense maybe in that
case what we're trying to find is the
best hypothesis in the hypothesis class
but we can still ask about computational
complexity in that case so as I was
saying successful hypothesis here by
that I meant well you know whatever it
is that the problem demands that we
return and if it's a hypothesis class
that's very limited we might just return
the best thing in that class okay but
the important thing here is that we're
not going to talk about computational
exiting for the most part we're gonna
focus on sample complexity for the time
being and that's really the relevant
concept when we're talking about the
idea of nature choosing I believe it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
