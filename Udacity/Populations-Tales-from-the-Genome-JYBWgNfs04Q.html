than just connect individuals the
broader scope of ancestry is about
populations and evolution for example i
know that i was born in the united
states but if i trace my relatives back
several generations i would find that i
have a strong connection to northern
europe in fact when I look at my 23 Emmy
ancestry report I find that I'm 98%
European I can zoom in here and I can
see what percentage of northern Europe I
am and that it maps mainly to the
British and Irish Isles we can also look
at the same information in chromosome
view and what I notice is that even
though me and my jeans currently reside
in the United States apparently my genes
have traveled over space and time all
the way from Northern Europe look how
much of my genome is from Northern
Europe and specifically regions from
Britain and Ireland a much smaller
percent of my genome we can see is from
sub-saharan Africa and much even smaller
region a teeny tiny region right here is
from South Asia when we think about
genes and alleles moving over time and
in geographic space we get a new
perspective on our past and it can also
be a lot more meaningful when you have
somebody who doesn't have quite the
homogeneous genetic background that I
have here we're looking at an example
from someone named Roy King and we can
see they have an amazing history
51-percent from sub-saharan Africa 43.3
percent European about 1.8 percent east
asian and native american and point two
percent south asian wherever this
individual is currently living their
genes are truly from all over the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
