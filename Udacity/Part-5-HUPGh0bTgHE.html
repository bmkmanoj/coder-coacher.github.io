definitely and then if next day is equal
to blanket which is the character we
want to counter the count is incremented
using the plus + operator then we read
the next character again using the read
function the read method on on the
streamer and then we print the character
that we just read should we really be
printing all these characters on a new
line every time or do we want the
sentence to actually look like the
characters or one after another in a
Senate you have to say that was not
specified so I made that decision that
doesn't sound like a very good decision
to me i mean anything you're gonna have
this this line of characters vertical
line of characters coming out that you
then it's difficult for you to check if
the sentence that i put in it was a
sentence try to figure out Alice you
know if it actually caught them all and
did I miss I'll carry lots of them good
kind of trucks right now it's a vertical
line of integers it's not even character
yeah it was true so it's even worse
useful yeah you're right ok ok ok that's
right I even realized that that was
going to be painted as an integer you
probably right and so it should be
really printed as a character problem I
guys I shall probably change that in
real life I mean you never even ran your
code once under test I did run it I
guess they put was just that hazel 8 is
like students in computer science
classes if it compiles it must work I
mean this is one of the advantages are
you doing oh I did this is actually you
know one of the advantages of
inspections amid this code is can just
part of a larger piece of code and so
we're just reading it right now and
didn't really go through a serious
testing busy i compile it sure there
were no syntactic errors we can continue
from here we can't continue thank you
hmm ok so at this point we were to get
bite me to go see if you can compile it
massif leavin
I'm not even sure if it compiled yet
well it may think of Paula can't
remember the last time I checked I know
it didn't work I didn't give us what we
wanted it does compiled though I mean
I'm positive okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
