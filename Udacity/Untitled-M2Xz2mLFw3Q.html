insight into how you use websites Victor
sure my pleasure if you could have our
students take away just two things from
this lesson what would they be first of
all make sure to use meaningful headings
and linked text as well as good pay
structure secondly as a general rule you
shouldn't try to control the experience
as screen reader user will have they
will use the information available to
them plus the tool they're using to find
that information on the webpage think
such as trying to control or fine-tune
exactly what a screen reader says or
making elements focusable which
shouldn't be generally lead to more
confusion and worse experience for users
that's really helpful advice thank you
now in our next lesson we're going to
take a look at what we can do if HTML
doesn't have the precise semantics we
need or if it's some reason or other the
HTML element would usually use isn't a
good fit for some other reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
