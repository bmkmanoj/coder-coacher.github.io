factors can influence the running time
of an algorithm so the size of the input
I think that's a rather obvious one so
in the example of Alice if she's running
her algorithm on a very small network
that takes much shorter time than if
she's running it on the huge 500
communication center network for example
the structure of the input can also
influence the running time of an
algorithm so for example if the network
was structured in a way that we find
that it can be covered with one or two
monitoring devices then the algorithm
could work in a way that we could
immediately stop and not need to look at
more complex assignments finally the
type of computer that we're using that
is also very obvious one if you're using
a computer that is much faster so say
we're using a huge workstation instead
of a simple laptop then the algorithm
will run much faster the amount of
memory the computer has that can also be
a very important factor although it
might not be obvious at first sight what
memory has to do with running time but
say the memory of your computer is not
enough to keep all the data that the
algorithm is using and it has to use the
hard disk for example to do some of the
work or the memory is not enough and the
algorithm has to recalculate certain
parts of the solution
so memory is also an important factor
for running time how the algorithm is
implemented that is of course very
important so are you using an
implementation that is very efficient or
do you have any unnecessary code or any
data structures that are inefficient
that can make a huge difference in the
practice when you run an algorithm and
finally the programming language use
that is of course a debate that many
people like to have but it's certainly a
factors so there are some programming
languages that will make an algorithm
run a lot faster than other programming
languages and so you need to think about
if efficiency matters you'll usually
also use a programming language that is
suited for that that's quite a lot of
factors to look at and actually I think
there are lots of other factors that
will also determine the running time of
an algorithm so that's why when we talk
about analyzing algorithms we'll have to
work with a number of simplifications to
focus on what's really important
not have to take account of all these
factors and all the countless others
that you might think of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
