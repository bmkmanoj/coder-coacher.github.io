tricky as it may look initially ok so
there's 10 to the 13 self let's figure
out what the net charge on each cell is
well each cell has 10 to the 15 protons
ok that will contribute some charge 10
to the 15 times the charged proton has
10 to 15 neutrons they don't contribute
at all and 10 to 15 electrons which will
contribute the exact same charge that
the protons contributed but negative the
positive charges from the protons will
cancel the negative charges from the
electrons the net charge on the human
body will be zero this explains why you
don't feel the electric force every day
you're much more familiar with gravity
because your body doesn't have a net
charge you could stand pretty close to a
charged object and you wouldn't feel
much of anything this may have just
raised more questions than it answered
because well let's see if everything's
neutral why do we even care about charge
how can we make something non-neutral
how can we give it a charge if lightning
is electricity well it seems like
there's a whole lot of it moving around
where does that come from let's answer
those questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
