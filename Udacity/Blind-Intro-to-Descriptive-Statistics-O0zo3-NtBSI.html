believe that they're taking the
medication this prevents participants
from being biased concerning the
effectiveness of the drug if they all
believe that they're taking the
medication then we're controlling for
this bias not letting the participants
know which treatment they received is
called blinding researchers use these
techniques when they suspect that
knowing which treatment you're receiving
might influence your behavior the
inactive pill in this case is called a
placebo placebos are fake treatments so
that the control group is unaware that
they are being treated differently when
I say they're treated differently I mean
they're not receiving the medication the
researchers didn't tell the participants
which pill they received because of
something called the placebo effect
people who know they're taking a placebo
might subconsciously think that the
placebo is not doing anything and this
will influence the results when they
report how well they slept
getting back to the quiz answers this
first option is untrue researchers only
use deception when they suspect that
knowing the actual intent of a study may
influence the participants behavior and
in that case information is kept hidden
until the end of the study these two
options are also not true participants
in experiments need to provide their
informed consent before the research can
expose them to any treatment letting
participants know that they may end up
in the control group as part of the
informed consent process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
