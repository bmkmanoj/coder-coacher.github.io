points we have point a and we have some
other point the shortest path between
them is just a straight line if we have
just one point on its own we wouldn't
know what direction to draw the line in
unless we had another point that we knew
we needed to aim toward if we want to
check that this is actually the line
that we were looking for however we need
one more point that supposedly lies on
the line to check that this is the
correct line so we need three points if
you want to check our original line so
maybe this point right here is the third
point that i had in addition to these
two we can see if the original line I
was starting to draw goes to this point
as well and voila we have one continuous
beautiful line let's say for example
that I had three points and I thought
that they all lay on the same line
because I thought that I had done my XY
table correctly unfortunately when I
bring my ruler into the picture there is
no way that I can get a line that I
would draw along my ruler to contain all
three of these points so clearly one of
my coordinates must be messed up so a
lot of the time just to be safe it's
great to have three points that you
think satisfy your equation just make
sure your graph is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
