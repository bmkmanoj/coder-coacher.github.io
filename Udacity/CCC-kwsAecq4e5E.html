Charles it is maybe who's asking it it's
me Michael I was gonna do another lesson
oh I like lessons how are you doing
Michael yeah I'm doing all right I
noticed that uh my favorite letter is on
the screen yes Charles likes the si si
si si Senor yes remember we had a we had
a lesson that was a tat like Triple A so
this is the Triple C lesson make sense
no no it makes sense what about the trip
will be triple B happened but you have
to pay premium rates to see that one
nice we quadruple your tuition now
there's there's no trip trip will be at
the current time but we can think about
that for later maybe for a third class
so let's see so we talked about game
theory and one of the cool things about
game theory is it let us reason about
sequential decision making and agents
and learning in the context of there
being more than one of them in the world
right so this is something that I wrote
in my in my dissertation is that in some
sense MDPs are very solipsistic Wow did
you actually write that I did it's in my
intro that what do you know the word of
course I do okay do you want to define
it for everybody no because that
actually would be ironic okay fair
enough so the idea of solid Scism is
that you're the only thing in the
universe everything else is just you
know kind of there yeah but you're the
only real thing and so one nice thing
about the game theory setting is it
actually lets us admit that maybe we're
not alone so what I'd like to do in this
lesson is actually dive in even more
deeply to that idea and talk about how
the MDP or the markov planning and
learning type framework can be adapted
to be able to talk about coordinating
between agents communicating between
agents and actually coaching between
agents that sounds perfect that's
actually the kind of thing that I like
to do and I like to think about as part
of my research so I am looking forward
to learning more excellent so the way
we're going to do that is actually look
at different ways that Markov models can
be kind of modified and and redefined so
that coordination and communication and
so forth is a natural property in the
model and we'll look at a couple
different models the first one is called
deck palm DPS and the second one is
called inverse reinforcement learning
and they kind of get at these different
issues in slightly different ways good
um I think well
do that we'll talk about it some more
layer okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
