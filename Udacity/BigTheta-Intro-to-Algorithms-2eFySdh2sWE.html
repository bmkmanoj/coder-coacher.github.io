graphs we ended up discovering that the
number of edges is two times the number
of nodes minus two times the square root
of n number of nodes which is such a
terrible function but the fact that
matter is as these analyses get more and
more complicated getting detailed
answers like this is more and more
cumbersome researchers have worked out a
scheme for talking about functions in a
much more high-level way while still
being completely rigorous but without
getting bogged down in all the details
and this is the notion of asymptotic
growth you may have heard it described
in the form of Big O notation and we're
gonna get to Big O in a moment but we
need to start off with big theta so big
theta of a function G of n is actually a
set of functions specifically the set of
functions to grow equally quickly as G
of n so to be a bit more formal about it
we say that some function f of n is in
the set of functions equally
fast-growing as G of n if and only if
there's some constants C 1 and C 2 and
some threshold and 0 such that for any n
bigger than n 0 we have something that
looks like this the function f of n for
all these values of n all these big
values of n is sandwiched between C 1
times G of N and C 2 times G of n so to
illustrate this idea with a picture
imagine we have some function f of n it
grows as n gets bigger if F of n gets
bigger we also have some function G of n
that we can multiply by C 1 or we can
multiply by some bigger number C 2 and
what we find is that once we get out to
the right of some threshold and 0 F of n
is always between C 2 of G of N and C 1
of G of n so in the beginning may be
weird things happen but once we get out
far enough asymptotically in the limit
as things get really big f of n lies
between C 1 times G MN and C 2 times G
of n if that's the case if such C 1 C 2
and n 0 exist and we can say that F of n
is in big theta of G of n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
