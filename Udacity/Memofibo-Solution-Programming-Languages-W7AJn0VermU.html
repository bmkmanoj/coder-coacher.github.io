together we initialize our chart to be
the empty mapping and I'm going to
define a procedure named memo fib o if
we're asked to compute the nth Fibonacci
number and it's already in the chart
then we don't do any more work we are
super lazy we just look it up in the
chart and return that otherwise we need
to both set the chart and return the new
value so if n is less than or equal to 2
the thing we want to write down to the
chart is one otherwise we'll figure out
the value of the chart by calling
ourselves recursively on n minus 1 and n
minus 2 then adding them together in any
event since we set the chart here or
here we'll just return the value in the
chart and now I've asked us to print out
the value of memo philbo 24 and we get
the answer that we are expecting however
the real proof is in the timing using
our timing code once again I've now put
in the code for memo fib 0 instead and
we're trying to compute memo 50 of 25
how long does it take to do this a
hundred times Oh significantly less time
remember before it was almost three
seconds almost half of our page budget
now you can barely detect it not a tenth
of a second not a hundredth of a second
but even smaller this was a phenomenal
cosmic optimization we are so much
faster it is not even funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
