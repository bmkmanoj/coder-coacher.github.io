determine the price of a house there's
gonna be a number of input features that
you might potentially be interested in
things like the square footage the
number of rooms in the house and also
things about maybe the neighborhood or
the location things like how well are
the schools ranked and how safe is the
neighborhood and these are all things
that you can measure fairly directly you
can go look up the school ranking on the
Internet you can measure the square
footage with a with a measuring tape but
I would argue that when you're making
these measurements you're really just
probing to things even though I have
four features here you're probing the
size of the home and you're asking
questions about the neighborhood and
these are two examples of latent
variables these are variables that you
can't measure directly but that are sort
of driving the phenomenon that you're
measuring behind the scenes so here's a
question suppose that the latent
variable that I'm trying to probe is the
size of the home that I'm interested in
place a check next to any of these
features that you think are basically
measurements that are probing the size
of the home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
