equations let's try to be a little bit
more formal a little bit more
mathematical about this idea so I'm
going to try to encapsulate what we just
talked about so the line of least
commitment by drawing another line so if
we think of this top gray line here is
sort of the line that gets as close to
the plus points as possible without
crossing over to them and misclassifying
them and we think of the bottom gray
line as the one that gets as close as
possible to the minus signs without
crossing over them and giving them as
classification and then the middle line
is sort of in the happy medium okay so
what you really want from the lines all
the lines that are possible between
these two boundary lines if I can use
that language is that somehow this
distance here is as big as possible can
you see that yeah though it seems like
the gray line could be pushed out a
little more right because the minuses
don't bump into it that's a good point
Michael and I'm going to fix that by
putting a minus sign here oh I see did
the best I could under the circumstances
data revisionist history no there's just
an invisible point and I just made it
more visible for the sake of the reader
okay so I've got these two lines these
are sort of as far as I can go without
starting to do miss classification with
my my separating line and the line in
the middle we've already argued is sort
of the best one because it provides the
least commitment so that means you want
to have a line such that it leaves as
much space as possible from the
boundaries alright Michael so let's see
if we can figure out exactly what that
line is like so the first thing I want
to do is introduce a little bit of
notation right so we all remember what
the equation of a line is it's y equals
MX plus B that's just the general
equation for a line but here even though
we're going to be drawing with lines we
really want to deal with the general
case where we're talking about
hyperplanes
and generally we write about hyper
planes we describe them as some output
let's just call it Y is equal to W
transpose X plus B we're here because of
what we're what we're
trying to do with classification the
output Y is going to be some value that
indicates whether you're in the positive
class or you're in the negative class W
are the parameters or W represents the
parameters for our plane along with B
which is what moves it out of the origin
okay are you with me
I think so but that's so maybe we should
get rid of that top Y because that Y is
a different kind of Y right so the top Y
is talking about the Y dimension of the
plane and in the second equation that Y
is kind of folded into the X and we have
a new Y which is actually the output of
the classifier right so I like that so
let's get rid of that first Y which is
just the normal equation for a line and
let's ask what each of these things are
so let's just say that again for clarity
sake I think you make a good point
Michael why here is going to be our
classification label right whenever
we're talking about using a linear
separator effectively what we've been
talking about which I realize now we've
never actually said explicitly is that
you are taking some new point projecting
it onto the line and then looking at the
value that comes out from projecting it
and in this case in particular we want
positive values to mean yes you're a
part of the class and negative eyes to
mean that you aren't a part of the class
okay yep this is our classification
label why W represents again the
parameters of the plane along with B
which is what moves it in and out of the
origin okay so this is now effectively
what our linear classifiers actually
look like even in multiple dimensions
with hyperplanes okay well so let's take
that and and push it to sort of the next
level let's figure out exactly what we
would expect the output of our
hyperplane to be in this example that
I've drawn on the screen here so we know
we want to find this orange line in the
middle which has the property that it's
your decision boundary it tells you
whether you're in the positive class or
the negative class on the one hand but
also that it has the property of being
as far away from the data as possible
while still being consistent with it so
if you're on the decision boundary for
this particular line which again
in is W transpose X plus B what would be
the output of this classifier for any
point that lies along the line so right
if that's decision boundary that's where
it's kind of not sure if it's positive
or negative so that should be 0 right so
the equation of this line or this
hyperplane is w transpose X plus B
equals 0 for some set of parameters W
and B we don't yet know what they are
but we do know that this is the
definition of a hyperplane or the
equation for a hyperplane and since it's
at the decision boundary it should give
neither a positive nor a negative output
okay yep ok now one question we can ask
ourselves then if we look at these other
lines as well what's the equation for
the other gray lines that are right at
our positive our negative examples so to
help you answer that I want to talk
about what the labels themselves ought
to be so just like we did with boosting
let's say that our labels are always
going to be from the set minus 1 and
plus 1 we know that our labels are minus
1 and plus 1 and so we're going to take
advantage of that fact by saying well
the line that brushes up against the
positive example we want it to be the
case since we know those labels are
going to be plus 1 that the output of
that particular line that particular
linear separator would be plus 1 on the
very first point that it encounters does
that make sense yeah ok way the things
that are that it's you know that are
kind of passed the line are going to be
above 1 and the things that are before
the line in that kind of Demilitarized
Zone are going to be between 0 &amp;amp; 1
right so in fact given what you just
said what is the equation of that line
oh I see so it should be the W transpose
X plus B equals 1 for the top gray line
that's exactly right
and by a similar argument what would you
say the the line of the hyperplane
should be for the bottom gray line
analogously it seems like that one
should be minus 1 right so we we have
the decision boundary were looking at
we know that the equation of the line is
w transpose x plus b is 0 we know that
if we slid that line towards the
positive values we would end up with W
transpose X plus B equals 1 and if we
slid it towards the negative values we'd
end up with W transpose X plus B equals
minus 1 now we can ask ourselves how
does this help us and it helps us in a
very simple way we know that we want the
boundary condition line the one that is
actually our decision boundary to be as
far as possible from both the positives
and the negative examples so that would
mean then I hope you buy this Michael
that the distance between the two grade
lines which are parallel to that line
needs to also be maximum yeah that's
exactly what we want right so we want
this vector here to have the maximum
length that we can have okay so how are
we going to figure out how long that
particular line is so here's a simple
idea well the lines are parallel to one
another we can pick points on that line
to define that particular distance there
so just because it's really easy to do
the math I'm going to choose a point
here and a point here those points have
the property that if I draw the line
between them you get a line that is
perpendicular to the the two gray lines
okay and I don't know what those X
values are but I do I'm just going to
call them x1 and x2 that seemed fair I
guess that seems it's good to name is
Annie and that is going to define the
two points that I have and the distance
between them is in fact going to be or
the vector that is defined by their
difference is in fact going to have the
length that tells you how far apart
those two lines are which in turn
because of the way that we've
constructed them tells you how far apart
your boundary decision line is from the
data and we want that to be maximum
because then we made the least
commitment to the data so let's write
that down as algebra the equation for a
positive line so to speak is therefore w
transpose x1 plus
B equals 1 and all I've done there is
substitute some point I don't have to
know what it is it's going to turn out
that gives me some point on that line
okay or gives me puts me in some
particular place on that line and
similarly I can do the same thing for my
negative line and get W transpose X 2
plus B equals minus 1 now we want the
distance between these two hyperplanes
or these two lines in this example to be
maximal and in order to figure out what
that means we need to know exactly what
that line is so it's it's the difference
between the two so we can just use our
favorite tricks when we're doing systems
of linear equations and just subtract
the two lines we basically have two
equations in two unknowns and we simply
subtract them from one another so that
we can get a single equation that
happens to represent the distance
between them so if I subtract the two
from one another what do I get
quiz oh I like that we get a quiz that
is a correct answer even though it seems
like a tight mismatch in fact quizzes
the right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
