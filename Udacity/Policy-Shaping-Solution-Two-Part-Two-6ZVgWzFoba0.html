not where I originally went I didn't see
the two thirds popping out because
really like you said there's no where's
the thirds there's nothing in the setup
of the problem that had thirds in it
right and so the way that I come to that
answer is I think about counting so
before when I said well if I know
there's only one and you tell me that
one that X is actually right that's a
one it's like also telling me that why
is not it and z is not it and kind of
the intuition here is that if the
probability of human correct is point
eight it's almost like I'm giving
eight-tenths of account that's like
saying that you got eight tenths of an
ex of a count going towards x and then
point2 for y and point 2 4 z which
you'll notice that if you normalize that
out works out exactly to be two-thirds
16 and 16 yeah so that counting thing
turns out to be a very powerful and we
can derive a more general version of
this so this quiz is actually both of
the quizzes I gave you are actually
designed to be easy uh yeah and you know
what makes them easy what makes them
easy is that we only had one one piece
of data you see you tried to take action
X and state s and you ended up being
told that was good but what if we had
done it 10 or 20 times and sometimes X
was said to be good sometimes said to be
bad sometimes y was said to be good
sometimes said to be bad then this kind
of natural this sort of process you went
through still works but you have to keep
track of a lot more things and this
counting argument actually helps and it
comes from exactly the crystal clear
generative model that uses Bayes rule
that you came up with so I'm gonna
actually write it down for you and we
can talk about it a little bit okay ya
know I'd like to see the general form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
