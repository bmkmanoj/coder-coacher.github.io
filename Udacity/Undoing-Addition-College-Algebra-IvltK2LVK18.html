doing that we can add we can subtract we
can multiply we can divide or we can
even do other operations but whatever we
do we have to keep one rule in mind no
matter what we have to do the same
operation to both sides of the equation
if we don't do this we're going to
change the initial relationship that we
started out with between our quantities
and the answer we get in the end won't
work with that equation let's start out
with a pretty simple example X plus 3
equals 12 now I'm going to draw two
boxes down here one for each side of the
equation and in each box I would like
you to write what step you think should
happen next to change either side of our
equation so that we can eventually get X
by itself for now though we're just
going to write this one step in so for
example if you think that we should add
8 to the right-hand side then write plus
8 in the Box on the right or if you
think we should divide by 2 on the
left-hand side please write a slash and
2 to symbolize divide by 2
please remember that if you want to
symbolize multiplication do not use an X
rather use the star symbol and then of
course whatever number you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
