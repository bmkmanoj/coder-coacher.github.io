been wanting to teach you ever since we
started learning about design and this
is about animating transitions it's easy
to throw in some Android L activity
transition animations to spice up our
application in Android 4.4 we added the
transitions framework but in Android L
we made it easy to apply these
transitions when moving between
activities as you can see clicking on an
item in our forecast list causes custom
animations to occur as we transition
into the next activity the toolbar at
the top and the bottom details move into
place and everything else fades hitting
the back key causes a slightly different
animation just the bottom moves out and
everything else fades this was done by
first creating a transition resource in
this case our transition resource
contains a transition set for how we
want our views to move we want all these
animations to play together for a
duration of 1/2 a second
we want everything to fade between the
views except for the status bar in the
navigation bar if we don't specify a
target in a transition it will apply to
all views exclude ID tells our fade to
apply to all views that aren't in
another transition pretty handy we're
going to have our toolbars slide in from
the top and the detail pane slides in
from the bottom and that's it we could
do a lot more but too much animation can
be distracting now we still have to tell
Android how to apply the theme I'm going
to add it to our custom theme we could
specify it in code but I recommend doing
it this way it's nice to be able to
change all of this from resources note
that we are both applying themes here
and setting a window flag to enable
content transitions content transitions
must be enabled in both the starting and
ending activity and then we still have
to write a tiny amount of code to enable
a scene transition when we call
startactivity we need to give the system
a special bundle
fortunatelly activity compat will do the
right thing for us and that's it see the
instructor notes for links to learn more
about animations and the transition
framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
