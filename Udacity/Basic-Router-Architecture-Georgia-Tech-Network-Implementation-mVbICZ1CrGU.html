architecture as a summary of basic
router function a router receives a
packet it then looks at the packet
header to determine the packets
destination it looks in the forwarding
table to determine the appropriate
output interface for the packet it
modifies the packet header such as
decrementing the time-to-live field and
updating the IP header checksum
appropriately and finally it sends the
packet to the appropriate output
interface the basic IO component of a
router architecture is the line card
which is the interface by which a router
sends and receives data when a packet
arrives the line card looks at the
header to determine the destination and
then it looks in the forwarding table to
determine the output interface it then
updates the packet header and finally
sends the packet to the appropriate
output interface now this drawing shows
just a single line card but in fact when
the packet is sent to the output
interface it must traverse the routers
interconnection fabric to be sent to the
appropriate output port so in fact we
can zoom out from that depiction of a
single line card and what we have is a
bunch of line cards that are all
connected via an interconnection fabric
each of these line cards has a lookup
table the capability to modify headers
and a queue or buffer for packets as
they enter and leave the line card in
other lessons we talked about several
important questions such as how big q
should be and how lookup works in the
rest of this lesson I'll discuss
important decisions in router design
such as the placement of look-up tables
on each line card and the design of the
interconnection fabric</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
