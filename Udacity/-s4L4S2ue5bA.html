important geometric properties of a
vector are its magnitude and its
direction these two terms are suggestive
of the mathematical concepts they
represent the magnitude of a vector
refers to how much movement it
quantifies and the direction of a vector
refers to where the directors movement
is pointed now let's see how to define
these concepts more formally if we think
of a vector as an arrow from one point
to another the magnitude of the vector
is the length of the arrow that is the
distance between the two points it
connects to calculate distance we can
use the Pythagorean formula in two
dimensions we can make a right triangle
by taking one leg to be along the x axis
one leg to be along the y axis and the
hypotenuse to be the segment between the
two points in question the length of the
horizontal leg is the difference between
the x-coordinates of the points and the
length of the vertical leg is the
difference between the y coordinates of
the points then by the Pythagorean
formula the length of the hypotenuse
squared is the sum of the squared
lengths of the legs now let's interpret
this in terms of the vector the
coordinates of the vector give the
difference between the coordinates of
the points the vector connects and the
length of the vector corresponds to the
length of the hypotenuse of the triangle
so the length of the vector squared is
the sum of the squares of its
coordinates in other words the magnitude
of V is the square root of its
x-coordinate squared plus its
y-coordinate squared note that we use
the double bars around the vector as
notation for its magnitude a
generalization of this formula holds
true in higher dimensions too if V is a
vector in n-dimensional space and we
call its coordinates v1 v2 up through VN
then the magnitude of V is the square
root of the sum of the squares of its
coordinates now using the notion of
magnitude we can define the direction of
a vector notice that all vectors
pointing in the same direction are
scaled versions of each other this
vector v2 is twice the length of this
vector v1 and this vector v3 is 1/3 of
the
of v1 so for each possible direction of
vector we have a whole class of vectors
pointing in that direction so to define
the direction of a vector we will choose
a canonical or representative element
from each class for simplicity we'll use
the vector of magnitude 1 from each
class we'll call these vectors the unit
vectors since they each have a length of
one unit each the process of finding the
unit vector pointing in the same
direction as a given vector is called
normalization normalization has two
steps if we want to normalize the vector
V the first step is to find its
magnitude the second step is then to
perform a scalar multiplication we
multiply V by the number 1 over the
magnitude of V this scales the vector up
or down so that its length becomes 1 so
if we wanted to normalize the vector V
equals negative 1 1 1 we first find its
length
the magnitude of V equals the square
root of negative 1 squared plus 1
squared plus 1 squared which equals the
square root of 3 then we multiply V by 1
over the square root of 3 the resulting
vector u would be negative 1 over the
square root of 3 1 over the square root
of 3 1 over the square root of 3 we can
check that U is actually a unit vector
by computing its magnitude in this case
the length of U is the square root of
negative 1 over square root of 3 squared
plus 1 over square root of 3 squared
plus 1 over square root of 3 squared
which equals the square root of 1/3 plus
1/3 plus 1/3 which is the square root of
1 which is also 1 since u has a
magnitude of 1 it is a unit vector it is
the unit vector pointing in the same
direction as V so U is the normalization
of V I should note one last point if all
the coordinates of a vector are zero we
call that vector the zero vector denoted
as the number 0 with an arrow above it
the zero vector is a vector indicating
no change
note that the magnitude of the zero
vector is zero however
what happens if we try to normalize the
zero vector we would end up dividing by
a magnitude of zero which causes all
sorts of problems so we simply say that
the zero vector has no normalization
another way to interpret this is that
the zero vector has no direction
just as it doesn't make sense to ask
which way a stationary car is moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
