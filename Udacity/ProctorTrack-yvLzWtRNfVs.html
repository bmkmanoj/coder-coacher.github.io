proctored exams a proctored exam is
similar to one you would take in the
classroom no books no notes no resources
just you and the test now of course in a
classroom that's easy to do there's a
teacher watching online it's not so easy
so we use a tool called proctortrack
which provides automatic proctoring
using cutting-edge AI and computer
vision and that's fascinating to me
we're using AI and computer vision to
deliver a program where you'll learn
about AI and computer vision to access
proctortrack you'll go to testing very
efficient comm as you see up here when
you first take a class that has a
proctored exam a proctor track account
will be created for you here and you'll
get the password in your email using
that login name and password
click here to login after logging in
you'll be back at the home page click
view tests to view the tests available
to you generally the first time you log
in you should see an onboarding test
click continue to open the onboarding
test then walk through the steps to
install the software on your computer
for the first time and experience what
proctoring is like when you have an
upcoming test it will be listed here as
well note that even after you've taken
the onboarding test it will continue to
appear here just in case you need to
setup the software on a new computer in
the future and as with other tools we
use proctortrack may change over time so
check the notes below this video to see
if there's anything new to be aware of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
