Miss rate is using larger cache blocks
they help the miss rate because more
words are brought in when we have a Miss
so subsequent accesses that might access
those additional words we brought in
will not be misses and they would be
misses if we had a smaller cache block
so this does reduce the Miss rate but
only when spatial locality is good but
when spatial locality is poor the miss
rate will increase because now what
happens is we bring in the word we need
and along with it now we bring more
words that we didn't need so effectively
our cache now looks like a lower
capacity cache because it has more junk
in it so we end up suffering more of
those capacity misses so if we plot the
Miss rate and how it changes as the
block size changes for a small cache we
might get something like this where the
miss rate drops as we increase the block
size but then starts increasing as we
exhaust the amount of spatial locality
that the cache can support but then it
starts to grow as we start to suffer
from the miss rate increase because
there is not enough spatial locality for
a four kilobyte cache this might happen
for example with a block size of 64
interestingly however for larger caches
we will start out with a lower mystery
to begin with and it will continue to
drop up to larger block sizes eventually
it's gonna start to increase but here we
might be looking at for example 256 byte
block size this effect has to do with
how much junk are we putting in the
cache and how much room there is in the
cache so some blocks will have more
locality than others and then in a small
cache those that don't have enough
spatial locality are creating some junk
and those that do have a lot of spatial
locality
they are being placed in the cache but
there is not enough room for them
because of all the junk when we have a
larger cache for example 256 kilobytes
then what happens is those blocks that
don't have enough locality put some junk
in the cache but the cache is bigger so
it can also contain those blocks that do
have spatial locality so the cache
tolerates a slightly bigger block size
so overall we can reduce the Miss rate
especially in a larger cache if we
increase the block size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
