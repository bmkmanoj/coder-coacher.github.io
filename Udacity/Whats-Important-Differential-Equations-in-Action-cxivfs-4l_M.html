is not important at all imagine that you
have two spacecrafts going along the
same trajectory you could join these two
form spacecraft of twice the mass and
that would still follow the same
trajectory so the mass is of no
importance the mass of the spacecraft
that is the size of the moon well we
should not be hitting the moon but
otherwise the size of the moon is not of
importance the motion of the Moon
however is of vital importance we have
to take care of that the rocket is fired
into empty space and the moon eventually
appears in the right place the size of
the earth is of vital importance to get
close to the surface as we return the
motion of the earth around the Sun isn't
that vital and should we be treating
this as a three-dimensional problem
imagine the earth is a sphere and the
moon as a sphere and the trajectory
takes us around earth around moon and
back this looks very three-dimensional
should we be dealing with XYZ
coordinates actually however this
trajectory is mostly in a plane if you
look at that motion from above we see
planar motion and it's almost ok to
treat this trajectory in a 2d fashion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
