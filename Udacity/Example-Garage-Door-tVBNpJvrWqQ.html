the garage door opener I've used
rectangles in this case but there are
six six states indicating the six states
we we listed before the the art the
transition arcs have two two expressions
on them the first one the first one is
the event causing the transition if
there's then a slash the second one is
the event to take that will happen upon
that transition occurring so imagine for
example we're at the bottom in the state
labeled door open motor off and in this
case there's only one outgoing arc the
user has pressed the button and in this
case the motor starts and it moves into
the state where the motor is running
downward the door was open it was at the
top hence the only place that the door
can go is downward similarly you can
walk yourself through the diagram the
interesting situation involving the
epsilon transition takes place if you
are in the bottom most state on the
right labeled motor running down if then
the button is pressed ok recall that the
first thing that happens is the motor is
stopped and we transition into the door
partially closed motor off state just
above it but then we go on ok remember
the safety concern the door was going
down and we stopped him we now want to
take it up so there's a transition to
the left in which there is no event
causing the transition ok so immediate
transition and what we want to do is
start the motor going upward and end up
in the state of the extreme left labeled
motor running up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
