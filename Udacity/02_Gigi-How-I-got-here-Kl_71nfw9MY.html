which is a very intrapreneurial place
when I finish that I started my first
company and like many of them it was not
very successful and then I said in my
second company which luckily was more
successful which I sold many years ago
talking about close to 20 years ago now
after that I became started my journey
to the dark side and moved to become an
executive in the company that acquired
my company moved on there after being a
CEO then became the CEO of another
company another company last company I
ran for five years was a publicly traded
company in London called 888 a gaming
company around 1,500 people dealing with
internet and started investing in
companies or 11 years ago as a hobby a
friend came to me with an idea I really
like the idea I gave him a bit of money
and a lot of advice and then after a
year I got a big fat check and I said
well I can do that I love that and so I
took all that money and I decided that
I'm going to reinvest it in other
companies and I was very lucky in that
some of the companies i chose became
more successful and so I continued with
it so over the years I I invested in
quite a few companies and then when i
left my last corporate rule five years
ago I decided that it's going to be a
good idea to not take another big ugly
corporate role and instead of it just
stick to the preneur ship and
investments and that's what I've been
doing the last five years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
