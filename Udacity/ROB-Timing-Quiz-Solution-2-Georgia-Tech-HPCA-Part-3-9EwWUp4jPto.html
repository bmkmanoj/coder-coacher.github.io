arrow be timing quiz this time so the
question is when does the add and
multiply issue and when do they commit
for issue the ad will try to issue in
the third cycle if we have a reservation
station available and we do because we
are currently using both of the multiply
divide reservation station but the add
one is free so the ad issues in cycle 3
and the next instruction multiplication
will try to issue in cycle four the
question is whether we have a free
reservation station indeed we do because
we have begun executing the
multiplication in cycle three here that
has freed one of the two reservation
stations we were holding so pretty much
at cycle for both of the multiply divide
reservation stations are actually
available so we can issue in cycle four
let's not put this here so we have three
and four when does this execute because
to figure out the commit we actually
have to figure out also when do they
execute and right result the ad uses our
7 and r 8 those are not written by any
of the previous instructions so the ad
can actually begin execution in cycle
four and because it takes only one cycle
it will try to write the result in south
of five now the multiplication is
already writing the result in cycle five
but we said that we can broadcast one ad
result and one multiplied result in the
same cycle this is a multiply this is a
device so they can actually go in the
same cycle so this will broadcast the
result also in cycle five now let's see
what happens with the multiplication
here it issues in cycle four it uses r1
and r2 so it actually cannot execute
until both of those results have been
written by instructions divide and
multiply here so we have to wait for the
later of these two which is cycle 6
that's when we dispatch we can begin
execution in cycle 7 this is a
multiplication takes two cycles so in
cycles seven and eight it's executing in
cycle nine it will write its result now
we are ready to figure out the command
we said that we can commit up to two
instructions per cycle in cycle eight we
are committing the multiplication here
the question is can we commit another
instruction in that same cycle because
normally we could if that instruction is
done and indeed it is because
this instruction has been ready to
commit sin cycle 5 all it was waiting
for is for the commit point to reach
there so in cycle eight here we will
commit it does the correct answer for
the community here is 8 and now finally
we need to figure out when does the
multiplication commit well it cannot
commit in cycle 9 because it doesn't
have a result written yet then but it
will try to commit in cycle 10 and by
that time previous instructions have
committed we have a result so indeed it
commits in cycle 10 so we can write 10
