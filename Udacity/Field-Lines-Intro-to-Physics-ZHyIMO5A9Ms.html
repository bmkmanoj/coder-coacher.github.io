electric field exerts a force on
particles if I have an e feel that looks
like this and I put a positive charge
there well it's going to feel forced to
the right and a negative charge would
feel a force to the left all right how
do I know how to draw these lines where
they come from where do they go let's
learn about that the field lines
themselves well I mentioned before that
electric field is not just felt by
charges it's created by charges so if I
have a positive charge well the
associate electric field will look like
this the field lines will be evenly
spaced and radiating outwards from the
charge this makes sense because I know
if I put a positive charge here well it
better be repelled from this guy and
according to this it will likewise a
negative charge looks very similar but
the field lines point inwards again this
makes sense I know that a positive
charge better be attracted to this
negative charge and according to this
electric field line it will be and a
negative charge if I put it here would
be repelled since negative charges go
opposite the direction of field lines
now knowing what you know about field
lines maybe you can tell me if I have a
positive and a negative charge and
they're next to each other what will the
electric field look like I'm going to
give you a few options and you pick the
best one so which of these four options
do you think best describes the electric
field that exists when you have two
charges a positive on the left and a
negative on the right do you think it's
this one do you think maybe there's no
electric field do you think it's this
one where there is an electric field but
it bends in this weird way or maybe this
one or that one think about it think
about maybe what would happen if you put
a positive test charge somewhere in what
direction you would expect the force to
be good luck this is a tricky question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
