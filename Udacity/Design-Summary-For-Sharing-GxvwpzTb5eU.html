let's review our current agreed upon and
D normalized data schema design i've
made some generic Jason to map out what
we've discussed for the final data
design and I went ahead and I included
in the instructor notes be careful about
not overriding your database with it you
can always make a new firebase app back
end if necessary to frame all this let's
think about the screens that we're
interested in the two that we've been
talking about a lot are the shopping
list fragment and the active list detail
screen and remember the goal is to allow
users to be able to create lists and
share lists and then they should only
see the list that they either own or a
shared on okay so I'm going to load up
the station and open up our back-end and
sort of walk you through what's going on
here are our top level nodes following a
discussion of two-way mapping between
users and the list they own I think the
best way to handle this sharing
functionality is to have a list of
shopping lists for each user here let me
show you we're going to have this note
here called user lists and this will
contain for each user a list of the
lists that they have access to that
means if kagura JP myself and Walter are
all in the shopping list plus plus
system then there would be a separate
list of shopping lists for each of us
and again these would be the list that
we either owned or shared with us so in
this case Walter has one list shared
with him and if he were to create or be
shared on with another list that would
also appear here and this is actually
pretty much all of the information that
we need for the shopping list fragment
you could go ahead and attach your
firebase list adapter here at the
encoded email address of the user who's
logged in so if Walter was the one log
did that we could attach a listener here
and it would very easily display the
list that he owns since we got the
shopping list fragment figured out let's
think about the active list details
screen for the list to tell screen will
need the list information which we could
grab here for the list of user lists and
we could get that because at that point
we should have the encoded email of the
user and the push ID of the list and
that gives us enough information to
drill down to the email and then the
push ID to get that list information and
from here we could get things like the
user shopping on the list at the list
name and then as we've already been
doing we d dorm alized and have the
shopping list items up here and we can
use that same shopping list push ID to
get the shopping list items for the list
as we've been doing okay so that
explains the use of both these your list
and the shopping list items now at this
point you're probably thinking that this
design has a
trivial amount of data copying here each
of us has our list of lists in user
lists and if we each make four different
lists and we own them this is what it
would look like but let's say that
Kagura decides that she wants to share
her book club snacks list with all of us
what this would then do is add a copy of
book club snacks to each of our lists a
total of three more copies now this
design here makes reading from the
database lightning-fast we never have to
search through a list of all shopping
lists or pull down any extra data but
you're probably thinking that there must
be some downside to all of us copying
well there is whenever you change
anything about the shopping list such as
if Grigori changed the list name to book
club snacks you need to do this for all
copies of the traffic list so now
instead of changing something in just
one place you need to change it in four
different places and more importantly
when you update a list you need a way to
know quickly if there are other copies
of that same list in the database
without Eddie extra sorting or filtering
for example if you're just looking at
this wilderness survival list here you
have no way to know whether it's been
shared with other users and for that we
have a note called shared with let's
take a look at it in the database so
here's shared with this note is kind of
like shopping list items for every list
that is shared you will have an entry
and shared with and the key of that node
will be the list push ID inside of that
node will be a list of users that that
shopping list has been shared with so
going back to our book club example when
you want to update the value of a list
such as the list name you have one place
where you can look up all the users of
the list is shared with this allows you
to construct the various URLs like
you'll need to get to the user list of
the database because now you have access
to everybody's encoded email you have
both parts the encoded email and the
push ID that you need to get to a
specific list okay so at this point
we've talked about shared with shopping
list items and user lists we're going to
keep around our list of users which
we'll just have all of the users that
are at our app and this is functioning
as it did before we'll also make some
user friends lists but i'll talk more
about that when we go into implementing
those screens okay so if you want to
take a look at this database structure
yourself you can load of the Jason file
with the instructor notes once you have
a handle on what's changed and what's
sort of going on here we'll start the
refactor from the huge list of shopping
lists that's currently stored in the
active list node to this new user lists
centric organization that I've described</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
