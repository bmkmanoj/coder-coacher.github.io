testing by considering again
program prints um if you remember this
is the same program that we use when we
were talking about black box testing
it's the program that takes two integers
a and B and produces as a result the sum
of the two and when we were looking at
this program in the context of black box
testing we didn't look at the
implementation but that's exactly what
we're gonna do now so we're gonna open
the box and look at how the code is
implemented and as you can see the
programmer was kind of creative because
instead of just adding the two numbers
and print in them he or she also decided
to print them in a specific color
depending on whether they were positive
numbers or negative numbers so positive
results are printed in red and negative
results are printed in blue and as you
can see by looking at the code we can
see some interesting cases that we might
want to test for instance you can see
that there are two decisions made here
so we might decide that this is an
interesting case and therefore we want
to test it similarly we might look at
this other case we might also decide
that this is another interesting case
and therefore we want to test this one
as well so let's discuss this in a
slightly more formal way by introducing
the concept of coverage criteria which
are really the essence of white box
testing first of all coverage criteria
are defined in terms of test
requirements where test requirements are
the elements the entities in the code
that we need to exercise that we need to
execute in order to satisfy the criteria
and we'll see plenty of examples of that
and normally when I apply a coverage
criterion my result is a set of test
specifications and we already saw that
specifications those are basically
descriptions specifications of how the
tests should be in order to satisfy the
requirements and they also result in
actual test cases which are
instantiations all the test
specifications and again this is exactly
analogous to what we saw when we were
talking about blackbox testing so let's
see what this means by going back to our
example a minute ago we looked at the
print some code and we identified two
interesting cases for our code and those
are exactly our test requirements so we
have a first test requirement here which
is the execution of this particular
statement and a second requirement here
and this one corresponds to the
execution of this other statement so for
this example there are two things that
we need to do in order to satisfy our
coverage requirements execute the
statement and execute the statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
