Udacity and today I'm at alt confit
'king with speakers about the talks that
they're giving here so I'm very excited
to be joined by Virginia Roberts hi Jin
yeah can you tell us a little bit about
yourself yeah I live in Seattle I just
got a job fairly recently as a program
manager at Microsoft before that I ran
my own business as an online dating
coach and I volunteer a lot with app
camp for girls in Seattle
Wow and you're here speaking it alt con
yeah my talk is actually called sell out
and save the world and it's about why I
quit running an indie business and took
like a corporate sellout job but I think
it's actually a lot more about a lot of
positive things that can happen from
having kind of a regular job including a
lot of the volunteer work that I do with
up camp for girls okay Wow well I would
be curious to hear about some of the
lessons that you learned from running
your own business and why you decided to
stop and start corporate well I will say
that the real the main reason why I quit
and why I'm giving this talk is that and
I realized over the decade that I was an
online dating coach that online dating
was changing as an industry and my role
as a coach was changing in a way such
that I helped make it worse and worse
and like more stressful and difficult
for people so I kind of didn't feel like
I was helping people anymore I didn't
feel like I was doing good in the world
I felt like it was actually kind of
doing harm in the world and so I wanted
to get away from that and I wanted to go
back to doing actual good but there's
lots of other lessons in running my own
business that are that are in there like
I I will never launch it does this again
without a partner like I was a solo
entrepreneur and I need like a yin and
yang like I need somebody who cares more
about the bottom line than I do because
it didn't really care that much like I
was all about helping people and not not
as hardcore about like we have to make
this much every month and maybe I could
use somebody who has that kind of
personality to offset and there's a lot
of other little things I would do but
that's a big one like I want to partner
next time
that's interesting it's interesting
hearing you reflect on on your solo
career with empathy as kind of a central
topic like am I able to make the world a
better place and help people through
this work or not I think a lot of us go
into technology because it's an
interesting problem space but we don't
necessarily feel like we are helping
people day to day the same way that you
would if you were working for a
non-profit for example so I think you
address this in your talk how did you
reconcile that like I want to make the
world better and I'm gonna do it while
working for a tech company you know I
think a big part of it was basically
recognizing that like you're not really
defined by your job but you can find
opportunities within a job to define
like the impact that you want to have so
like and the bigger and kind of more
corporate seeming the company actually a
lot of times the more the benefits in
the infrastructure and the culture can
help you contribute to doing nonprofit
ii type work and like even though I'm
not working full-time at a non-profit I
make enough money to be able to donate
my donations get matched I'm able to
connect with more people and ask them to
donate and it's like socially acceptable
to do that you know there's like
charitable giving campaigns and they
have deeper pockets and bigger networks
too and they can also just like help
problem solve in a bigger way like if we
need more campers to fill a camp or if
we need somebody who owns a restaurant
to have an event at or somebody who
knows a charter bus company like the
Grand Network of Microsoft does a better
job of figuring out those answers than
just me on my own talking to a few other
cash-strapped indie business owners
right so there's a lot of ways in which
in which I feel like I can kind of
amplify the impact that I have well
still kind of you know having a regular
job - right I think that the impact that
I've made volunteering with AB camp even
if maybe I put in I don't think I
actually put in fewer hours they're just
differently times now but it arguably I
put in a different level of effort and
I've just figured out how to kind of
optimize right so that in a way is a
very tech like problem to solve so how
did you first get involved with app camp
for girls you know it's kind of funny if
I really backtrack I actually met the
woman who eventually went on to found
app camp Jean McDonald because we were
both women on app net which was like a
somewhat short-lived social network that
was kind of like the developer ish
alternative to Twitter and it didn't
last right like I don't think it's
really a thing anymore but Jean reached
out to me and she was in Seattle for
something anyway and so we got together
and had a drink and eventually when she
started brainstorming and I think she
actually came to WWDC and was in a
session where she realized she was only
the like neither the only woman or one
of the only women and she was kind of
horrified at how bad the gender
imbalance was and so she wanted to try
to fix that she had gone to rock camp in
Portland and had an amazing experience
learning how to like play rock music
with other women in Portland for a week
and she was like we could do a version
of this but from making mobile apps with
girls and get them excited about and
feeling welcome in STEM careers you know
at an earlier age and so that's exactly
what she did she quit her job at smile
software like a major Mac developer she
kind of transitioned out of that she
started a nonprofit the first camps were
in Portland and then and then they
branched out into Seattle and I've been
the emcee for every year that Seattle
has had a camp very cool and app camp
for girls did a crowdfunding campaign
yes they did and actually we're working
on some ongoing donation stuff we're
having a fundraising party tomorrow
night after after the the session that I
speak at was very exciting and we are
looking to very soon launch things like
ongoing contributions like people can
donate monthly stuff like that it's
surprisingly hard to find infrastructure
for nonprofits that is affordable that
lets you process payments in a way that
works for your business but I'm excited
that that is getting kicked off so I
think you can probably keep an ear out
for more and different types of
fundraising shortly
I see so just like the it was announced
yesterday that the app store will be
adding subscriptions for all apps
nonprofits like out camp for girls are
also adding yeah we are also adding
subscriptions different types but yes
exactly is a year of
scription x' and honestly I mean I think
recurring gifts for me anyway like the
idea of giving for example $10 a month
is easier to swallow somehow than like
$100 a year and you're actually donate
more that way so it's like I think when
you make things more accessible to
people and you allow them a path to
feeling like they're contributing and
making a difference easier which is
really helpful and important so it's
been on our goal list for a long time
and I'm excited to be moving forward
with that so here's a question that I
think a lot of our students who are male
might wonder like they know that it's
important to help young women discover
tech and and consider STEM careers but
they're not exactly sure how to help
would you have advice for someone who is
trying to figure out what they can do
yeah I mean I actually covered this a
little bit in my talk and I think one of
the really pleasant surprising benefits
but I wasn't really aware of going into
my work at Microsoft is that the
infrastructure with companies like that
is such that there's already a place
like if you identify that you want to
help there are people who will put you
to use right Microsoft actually has a
program I think it's called dizzy girls
it's very similar to AB camp for girls
it has really similar goals and I think
that we also have a program called teals
which is like classroom educators
teaching technology so there's a lot of
ways like if you realize that you want
to help make an impact if you work at a
bigger corporation you kind of just have
to figure out the right places to look
and who to ask because usually there's
some kind of charitable partnership or
development that will that will make use
of that and but I also think expressing
that desire doing a little self
education right like Google Bing you
know Doug go it but like figure out what
what's going on in your area and there
are usually meetups there are usually
programs and frankly I think to money is
a big helper right like sometimes what
you just need is laptops and you can't
take a fancy refurbishment thing that
somebody coordinates you have to have
everybody on the same hardware set so
they're ever there's parity and so it's
like you just have to be able to buy six
new MacBooks right or something like
that so I think that becoming
comfortable with the idea of charitable
giving is
part of it but there's a ton of every
every major city will have programs and
a community that cares about this you
have to just look for it right you have
to be proactive
have there been specific students at app
camp for girls who have inspired you
they I mean she's the answer don't care
they all inspire me like it's incredible
to see them start to blossom and I think
the thing that I find most exciting is
when I can see people sort of individual
career tracks emerging as as the the
week unfolds like you see who doesn't
want to let anyone else have a turn on
Xcode because they're having so much fun
like figuring out you know all the
little functions that we program in and
and and you start to see the people who
are really good icon designers who are
like that's pretty but it's not gonna
scale down small think about what a
little you know and you see the scrum
masters were like kind of starting to
get anxious about when are we gonna have
everything ready on time for the pitch
and it's just so cool to see future
careers happening in the space of one
week in that room right so I think just
seeing everyone light up and get
inspired is really helpful I will also
say there was a particular camper who
wrote a very nice handwritten card and
she drew an owl that was kind of like
our logo and she wrote a card to all of
the volunteers but the one that she
wrote to me was that like the
icebreakers that I led the groups in
seem cheesy in whatever but she's
actually really shy and it really helped
her come out of her shell and bond with
the other girls so she thanked me for
that and I was just like oh dear you
know yeah yeah it's really sweet okay so
speaking of careers how do you figure
out what it is you want to do what it is
you're good at and where you can do that
kind of work I mean in some ways I feel
like I'm still figuring that out and
everybody is still figuring that out but
I think I've done a lot of introspection
and about this sort of thing and I think
being an indie business owner forced me
to so I would say like early on when
subjects start to interest you in school
figure out how that translates to real
world work I think a lot of the time
like the spark of interest in math in
science in for me it was languages and
linguistics and somewhat computer stuff
like I didn't know what that looked like
in the day to day and of course in
technology the jobs change all the
but even having a sense of like what the
offices look like what the co-workers
seem like what the pace of the schedule
is like is it a job where you're sitting
up or standing down like are you working
9:00 to 5:00 or are you working other
hours like I think starting to figure
out the real world translation of
whatever subject sparks you early is
important I wish that I'd take advantage
of internship and externship
opportunities in college because I was
kind of a slacker in college and I
didn't do that and I would have if I if
I could do it over but I also think
there are a ton of life factors that
people need to pay attention to and
don't someone just asked me to answer a
question on Quora the other day about
whether they should take an internship
in the summer at Amazon or PayPal and I
said you know I'm not a developer I
don't know exactly what professionally
in that arena would be good for you but
think about like do you prefer living in
a red state or a blue state like do you
need to be near water do you need to be
near mountains do you like hot weather
do you mind when it's gray and rainy
like what are the things that you value
outside of just the actual work you're
gonna do because I think people accept
jobs or pursue careers and have this
kind of quality of life crisis I went to
a college where a lot of people go to
grad school and get higher ed degrees
and end up with professorship positions
and that can be really cool but it's
also like if what they really wanted to
do was research but they're stuck seeing
a bunch of classes and they're in a
small school in Alabama somewhere
conservative even though they're gay and
they can't really be out like that's not
a good life fit even though it seemed
like a good professional choice so I
think considering all of those other
things that make you a happy and
well-rounded person are just as
important as considering the
professional but that's not the message
that most people at 17 18 or 22
you know just graduating from usual sort
of school programs get and it's not to
say you shouldn't think about the actual
work of course you should but you can't
think about that in a vacuum yeah a lot
of our students head down one career
path and realize actually they want to
be coding but that's not what they're
doing
so they have to make a career change and
that's part of why they take our courses
do you have advice for people who are
changing careers you know as you just
did switching from your independent
business to to working at a company you
know I'm sure that interviewing for a
role that was very different from what
you had been doing day-to-day was a bit
nerve-racking perhaps it was and it
wasn't the first interview that I had
right it was maybe the third or fourth
job that I interviewed for that I
actually finally found a good fit and
was hired I think the big thing for me
is understand what you want out of the
change make sure that you are not making
a change just because you're not sure
what to do with your life make sure
you're making a change because you know
that it's a path that you want
particularly if finances are struggle
because I think spending a lot of money
on a coding camp or a degree when you're
not sure that that's the right path is
stressful and then that sets you back
even more but assuming that you know
most Udacity folks I would think are
committed to coding I'm probably gonna
be one of those people who at some point
later in life takes on some kind of
technical education and pivots into an
even more technical career every every
year at app camp I'm jealous of the
campers learning more coding than I can
but I've learned that I kind of can't
shadow them as much as I want to as an
MC because I have other work that I need
to do in order to do my job well so I
can see myself doing the career change
later in life I think the big thing is
like figure out when it fits in look for
the opportunities like I see so many
interesting scholarships and I see
programs that are they're geared towards
that's and you know I think that if you
if you look for their success rates that
are placement rates and you look for a
place that feels good and has the
network but are the kind of people that
you could see referring like like you
just have to block out that time and do
it right like you just have to kind of
bite the bullet and commit at some point
and say I'm gonna spend these three
thousand dollars or these three months
or whatever it is and really do this
thing and I think it can be hard to
force life transitions but look to the
network that whatever program you're
doing can then provide because that's
such a huge benefit of it and you know I
think
that's another thing you know that I
didn't quite do in college like I went
to college on the East Coast but I knew
I probably wanted to live in Seattle
where I grew up and and all the
connections we're not there so like go
to a code camp with connections that are
gonna be relevant for the professional
life that you then want to have so a lot
of our students are they're not straight
out of school they're changing careers
it's it's kind of a scary thing you know
interviewing for a position that's
different from the kind of position that
you've been holding and I know you just
went through this so do you have any
advice for people who are making our
career change yeah I I think there's a
couple takeaways that I would say like
number one you just have to do it right
like you just have to commit I think
make sure that the program that you're
going into is in the community and has
the kind of connections that you would
want professionally like geographically
and just like people wise make sure
you're getting you're spending that kind
of time and energy career changing in a
direction that will be the right fit for
you professionally but I also think a
big part of it when you're actually
interviewing and kind of selling
yourself is that you have to figure out
how to frame your old experiences
relevant for the new experiences that
you're gonna have so when I got this job
at Microsoft it was largely talking
about yes the successful business that
I'd run but like mostly my customer
focus in that business and talking about
app camp and all the leadership that I
did there and that wasn't a way that I
would have thought to position myself to
get a new job but it worked right and it
was really successful so you kind of
have to figure out how to sing the
praises and the benefits of what what
you bring to the table regardless of
what your prior path was fantastic
advice so would you have any advice for
young girls who are just starting to
think about coding yeah I would say find
groups and meetups and communities
particularly consider finding groups
that are focused on girls and women and
minority and then tuck even if it
doesn't feel like you need to do that I
think that you'll be surprised what a
different environment it is from from a
more sort of mixed classroom I think
that you might feel more empowered and
you might find different perspectives so
and those
these are really really good and dogged
at helping people succeed and so you're
gonna find a lot of sort of level right
opportunities in your career if you if
you pursue this kind of community so get
involved like find them meetups make
your parents drive you to them do
whatever it takes but like find the
people fantastic advice well thank you
so much for talking to us Virginia thank
you okay really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
