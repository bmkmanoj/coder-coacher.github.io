program it's made very tangible it's all
very real-world examples and the program
really forces you to figure things out
on your own sometimes tells you here are
the resources here's where to look but
it doesn't give you the answer
programming especially nowadays it's
like what you think is what you can make
it's very fascinating for me is that I
think of a website and then I can just
go and make it so your imagination is
pretty much the limit I ended up doing a
bunch of hackathons and a bunch of other
tech events and then almost backed out
you know I was freaking out like I'm
gonna have to polish a craft what can I
bring here a bunch of students that I
met along the way who decided to come
together and work on a project just to
get more experience i pitching an idea
for just app for managing like roommate
relations instead of chore management
and we won we ran through a bunch of
ideas and then it seemed like an idea to
host ideas would be awesome so that
other students can come there and they
can get inspiration they can build those
projects even talking with friends who
have computer science degrees they see
what I made and they say wow you made
that so when you show this app that you
built they get a really clear measure of
what you actually can do I'm Allison
Marie Cooper my full name is persona sri
continuity I'm actually currently
enrolled in the front-end web
development program I have a nano degree
in full stack in today and I'm a full
stick engineer now
