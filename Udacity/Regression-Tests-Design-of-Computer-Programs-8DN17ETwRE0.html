dictionary of hands that map from a hand
to a set of words that I found and the
idea here is that this test is not so
much proving that I got the right answer
because I don't know for sure that this
is the right answers rather this is what
we call a regression test meaning as we
change our program we want to make sure
that we haven't broken any of these that
we haven't made any changes to our
function so even if i don't know this is
exactly the right set i want to know
when i make a change have I changed the
result here and so I'll be able to rerun
this and say have we done exactly the
same thing I'll also be able to time the
results of running these various hands
and see if we can make our function
faster so here's my list of hands I've
got one two three four five six seven
eight hands and then I did some further
tests here i'm testing removing letters
got all those right and then i'm going
through the hands and i'm using my time
call function that we built last time
and that returns an elapsed time and a
set of results i make sure all the
results are what I expected and then I
return the time elapsed for finding all
the words in those eight hands and it
turns out it takes half a second now
that kind of worries me that doesn't
sound very good sure if I was playing
Scrabble with a friend then they reply
and a half second that'd be pretty good
much better than me for example in this
game here it says that I haven't replied
to my friend Ken in 22 hours so this is
a lot better but still if we're going to
be doing a lot of work and trying to
find the best possible play half a
second to do evaluate eight hands that
doesn't seem fast enough so why is fine
words so slow well one thing is that
it's got a lot of nested loops and it
always does all of them and a lot of
that is going to be wasteful for example
let's say the first two letters in the
hand where z + q at the very start here
w is Z plus Q and now I loop through all
the other combinations of all the other
letters in the hand trying to find words
that start with Z plus Q but there
aren't any words in the dictionary that
start with zq and so as soon as I got
here
I should be able to figure that out and
not do all the rest of these nested
loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
