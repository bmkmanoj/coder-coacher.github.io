the last two books of stamps i'm going
to show you two ways of doing this and
then we're going to figure out which way
is correct based on our diagram for this
first one I'm going to start in the
parenthesis I know I need to simplify
containers first when I look at this too
I can choose between the exponent or I
can choose multiplication I'm going to
choose the exponent first so I'll get 2
times 5 times 4 I know 2 squared is 4
right here I have multiplication
remember that whenever you have a number
outside of a parenthesis we just have
multiplication in front 5 times 4 is 20
and I finish simplifying my parentheses
now I can do 2 times 20 which is 40 this
time for the second one I'm still going
to start in parentheses but for this too
I'm going to choose the multiplication
over the exponent so I'm going to do
five times to first so i'll have 2 times
10 squared I know 10 squared is 100 so i
have 2 times 100 and I get 200 ok one of
these answers is correct I know that in
one book of stamps I have 20 stamps so
in two books I must have 40 stamps so
here are two books of stamps and i can
see that i should have 40 stamps all
together so i know that this method was
correct so let's go back and look here's
where I made the choice the two could
have been paired with multiplication or
with exponents I know that the two
should be paired with the exponent the
exponent takes priority over
multiplication so with our order of
operations we know that we need to add
in another priority ok so when faced
with the decision between an exponent
and multiplication I know that the
exponent or the power should come first
so powers take the highest priority in
our order of operations when doing my
order of operations I know power should
come first multiplication and division
should come second and then addition and
subtraction chicken third so you might
be wondering where parentheses fit on
our order of operations well we just
need to make sure we do the order of
operations within each parentheses we
need to simplify any parentheses or
brackets before we do any outside
operations on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
