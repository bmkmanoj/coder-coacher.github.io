layout can have a vertical orientation
or horizontal orientation we also
learned that individual views can have
weight values to fill up the extra space
and the parent now we're going to spend
some time learning more about the
relative layout view group this will
help you build even more flexible
layouts
do you remember ray the relative layout
he's the dad and he's represented by
this view group here he helps the
children Muse be positioned within this
container with a relative layout you can
position children relative to the parent
such as the top of the parent or the
bottom of the parent the other option is
to position children views relative to
other children like this let's focus
first on the case where our views can be
positioned relative to the parent for
this example this parent relative layout
is set to have width a match parent and
height of match parent so it's as big as
the device the children inside the
relative layout can be positioned
relative to the parents left top right
or bottom edges this is the code for it
on the child view XML elements for
example for the image view or text view
you would add these attributes the
attribute name follows this format
Android colon layout underscore align
parent top this attribute determines
whether the child view is aligned to the
parents top edge or not so the possible
values are true or false if it's true
then the view should be aligned to the
parents top edge if it's false then it
shouldn't be aligned there are
attributes for all the other edges as
well for example align parent bottom for
aligning to the parents bottom edge
there is a line parent left for aligning
to the parents left edge and then
there's a line parent right for aligning
to the parents right edge you can mix
and match and use multiple of these
attributes at a time take this image
view as an example we would set the
attribute align parent top to be true
because it's aligned to the parents top
edge it's also aligned to the parents
left and right edges so we set left to
be true and right to be true as well
it's not aligned to the parents bottom
edge so we said that to be false and for
this text view down here it's aligned to
the parents bottom edge right edge and
left edge
so a line patent bottom would be true a
line parent left will be true a line
parent right would be true but a line
parent top would be false in addition to
positioning a child at the top portion
or bottom portion of the screen you can
also do specific corners if we want to
position the birthday textview in the
top left corner we say a line parent top
to be true and then a line parent left
to also be true to position in view in
the top right corner we want to align
into the parent's top edge and right
edges so aligned parent topicals true
and aligned parent right equals true for
the bottom left corner
we're aligned to the parents left edge
and bottom edge so we say aligned parent
bottom equals true and aligned parent
left equals true these values are false
and they're false by default so you
don't need to include them in the XML
code and then for the very last corner
it's aligned to the parents right edge
and bottom edge so aligned parent bottom
and aligned parent right are equal to
true the other two are false so we can
leave them out of the code believe it or
not there's even more attributes that
you could set you can also Center the
view horizontally so you set Android
layout underscore Center horizontal to
be true and you can also add it to the
existing attributes we learned before so
if this is aligned to the bottom and
it's centered horizontally it would look
like this the last one I'm going to show
you is layout Center vertical if this is
set to true then it centers the view
vertically within the parent the reason
why this textview is aligned to the left
edge of the parent even if we didn't set
this value is because all views that are
added to the relative layout are
positioned by default in the top-left
corner of the view group all of these
attributes are called view group layout
parameters even though they're declared
on the child XML elements they're used
by the parent view group to know how to
position the children thus they all
start with layout underscore this also
follows the pattern of layout underscore
width and layout underscore height which
are already familiar with those two
attributes are also viewgroup layout
parameters because they're used by the
viewgroup parent in order to position
and size the children and here's the xml
for a relative layout and it's children
you can follow along in the link below
we have an opening relativelayout tag
and we have a closing tag at the bottom
here and all the children are in between
the width and height of the relative
layout is set to be matched parent since
this is the layout for our whole app
it's going to take up the whole screen
there are three child text views inside
the relative layout the first one is a
textview that says happy the width and
height are wrapped content and we have
these additional attributes to help the
relative layout know where to position
this child textview we tell it to align
to the parents right edge and to align
to the parents top edge so that puts the
happy textview in the top right corner
of the screen for the birthday textview
the width and height are also wrapped
content then we want to align to the
parents bottom and left edges so the
bottom and left edges leads to this
corner down here this last textview that
says to you doesn't have any specific
attributes specifying where it is
relative to the parent all we know is
that the width and height should be
wrapped content as I mentioned earlier
if you don't specify where a child view
should go by default the relative layout
we'll add it to the top left corner of
the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
