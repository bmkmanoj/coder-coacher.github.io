statements before they're used in java
sea based languages Ruby but they are
arguably less intuitive than if-else
statements you'll be seeing a lot of
them in Swift though and hopefully come
to appreciate their conciseness switch
statements are great when you're trying
to assess multiple conditions especially
when your conditioning on multiple
values of a given variable here's an
example of an if-else statement that
might be better written as a switch
statement it's a statement about the
years of the Chinese zodiac you can see
that even though I'm just looking at a
few values that match the years of the
monkey in the years of the goat my
statement is already getting a bit
cumbersome if we write this as a switch
statement it's easier to manage switch
statements take the form switch then a
type name the type whose value your
conditioning on case the first value
possible for this type colon then the
statement that will be executed if this
case is true note that you can combine
two or more values into the same case as
in this third case at the end of the
statement comes a default case this last
statement is executed if none of the
other cases are true it's important to
include this default case because the
switch statement must account for every
possible value of a given type every
value must match at least one case so
for our chinese zodiac example you can
see that the statement switches on the
value of the variable birth year if
birth year has a value of 1992 nineteen
eighty or nineteen sixty-eight this
print statement is executed you were
born in the year of the monkey if birth
year has a value of 1991 1979 or
nineteen sixty-seven the second print
statement is executed so let's change
birth year to 1991 and we can see you
were born in the year of the goat and if
the value of Berthier doesn't match any
of these six values the default
statement is executed so if this was
1993 the default would be executed let's
scroll down and look at another example
here's a program that depicts the
visible spectrum it sets a variable
called color based on the value of a
variable representing light wavelength
here we can see the ellipsis again
remember that in Swift this is the
range operator so these values represent
ranges of wavelengths within which
certain colors fall if we alter the
value of the wavelength variable we can
see different values being assigned to
the color variable in the sidebar notice
that the value of wavelength doesn't
have to match the specified range it
just has to fall within it one aspect
that distinguishes switch statements and
Swift from switch statements in C for
example is that the flow of control does
not fall through from one case to the
next what do I mean by fall through well
imagine moving through the switch
statement and checking each case in turn
what should happen when a condition is
met should execution of the statement
stop or move on to evaluate the rest of
the cases to fall through is to continue
to evaluate the remaining cases and
Swift if the conditions of one case are
met the statement is done let's look a
little closer at what happens when
switch statements don't fall through
this example switches on temperature I
live in California so I'm pretty much a
wimp when it comes to the cold here you
can see that 55 degrees appears in both
the first and the second case so what
will be the output when the temperature
is 55 the console prints out burr and
then it's finished evaluating this
statement it's done the second case is
never evaluated the console never prints
out comfortable even though 55 does
match that second case so what if I left
a statement out what would happen let's
find out what if I left out this
statement okay we get an error what does
it say case label and a switch should
have at least one executable statement
every case needs an accompanying
statement because with no fall through
if a case matches the program needs to
be able to execute a statement and then
be done that's all for now on control
flow be sure to complete the exercises
to get lots of practice with for in
loops and switch statements and stay
tuned for the next lesson on functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
