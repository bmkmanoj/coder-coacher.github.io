relations between close family members
or close relatives blocks a certain
amount of genetic shuffling and
maximizes the chances that recessive
traits will be uncovered in offspring
now this happens often times because
family members share common ancestors if
you haven't affected relative at some
point in the family tree let's say this
is a recessive trait that means that
he's homozygous recessive for this he
has the past at least one allele on to
the offspring we're going to assume
they're heterozygous here even though we
don't know that but they have at least
one recessive allele and then if they
pass that down to their offspring here
we have first cousins if they were to
produce a child at this point there's a
significant chance that that child could
inherit both recessive alleles one from
each parent so what this means is that
when you are a carrier of a particular
allele that's hidden because the trade
is recessive if you go out in the
general population almost no one's going
to be affected by this because in
general disease traits like this are
rare one in 20,000 one in 50,000 so
going outside of your gene pool will
reduce the probability you're going to
find anyone else with the same variant
or allele but when you stay within your
own gene pool there are other
individuals with the same alleles that
you have and if some of those alleles
are deleterious or detrimental or
alleles that you'd rather not showing up
in your offspring you should avoid
inbreeding because there's a much higher
chance that those alleles are going to
show up in homozygous condition and
affect your offspring or your children
ultimately inbreeding defeats the
success of meiosis specifically to
recombination in independent assortment
parts evolution has gone to great
lengths to ensure that the mitotic
processes of sexual reproduction are
engrained in every living thing because
mixing and matching alleles is a really
important part to a population and a
species survival so when individuals
mate with in there
pull all of the effort the meiosis goes
to to make sure there are lots of
different alleles to choose from and
recombine with its kind of defeated
because you're staying in a gene pool
that has the same alleles available so
there's a much higher probability that
any bad alleles are going to show up in
homozygous condition in the offspring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
