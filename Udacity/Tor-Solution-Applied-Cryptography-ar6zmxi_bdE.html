here is to download the set of routers
from a trusted directory this has some
pretty serious drawbacks though the
other choices well asking Ellis if Alice
actually knew everything could work but
not everyone can ask alice using SSL
Certificates would be a good way to get
the public keys starting from some root
certificate authority to validate the
public keys of the routers and that
could be used as part of it that doesn't
tell you what the routers are though we
need some way to identify the actual
routers as well as their public keys we
could send messages or Ranma nodes this
would work if a large fraction of the
notes on the Internet where tour routers
we could also require that every router
implement store this would be great but
is not very practical so what actually
happens is that there's a list of known
routers on the network that can be
downloaded from a trusted directory
there's a big problem with this and that
someone who wants to censor anonymous
communication which a regime that
someone is using tor to get around might
well want to do can also find these
notes and the sensor can download the
trusted directory as well and block all
traffic to those notes so this is a big
challenge for networks like tour to
figure out ways to distribute the
routers that is accessible and can be
used by people that they want to use it
to communicate anonymously but isn't
visible to a sensor that would want to
block all of those routers there's no no
one great solution to this but i would
encourage an open discussion on the
forum about ideas you might have how to
solve this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
