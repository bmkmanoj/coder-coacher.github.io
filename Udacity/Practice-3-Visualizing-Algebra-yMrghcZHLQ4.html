you did a great job let's see how we got
that answer remember the first thing we
have to do is find the slope between
these two points we know that the
equation for slope is y2 minus y1 over
x2 minus x1 now to make sure I put the
values in the right places I always
labeled one of my points x1 y1 and the
other point x2 y2 that way I make sure I
plug them into the right places so when
I find the slope y2 minus y1 is y2 is 7
minus y 1 is negative 3 over X 2 which
is two minus x1 which is negative 27
minus negative 3 is 10 to minus negative
two is four and 10 / 4 can be reduced to
five halves so we know that the slope of
our line so we know the slope of our
line is 5 halves now that we know the
slope we can find the equation of the
line in order to find the equation of
the line we use the equation M equals y
minus y1 over X minus x1 now i plug in
what I know the slope is 5 halves and
that's going to equal Y minus y1 y1 is
negative 3 over X minus x1 which is X
minus negative 2 let's go ahead and
write these again 5 halves equals y
minus negative 3 is y plus 3 and X minus
a negative 2 is X plus 2 now I can
simply cross multiply when i cross
multiply i have 5 times X plus 2 equals
2 times y plus 3 I have to remember to
distribute after i distribute i have 5x
plus 5 times 2 is 10 equals 2y plus 2
times 3 is 6 since I want this equation
in standard form I'd need the x and y
terms on the left side and the constant
on the right side so i can subtract 10
from both sides to move the constant
over to the right and I have 5x equals
2y minus 46 plus negative 10 is negative
4 and then i have to subtract 2y from
both sides and i get our final answer of
5x minus 2y equals negative 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
