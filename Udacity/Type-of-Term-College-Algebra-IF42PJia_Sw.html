question we've talked a lot about
vocabulary but applying your knowledge
can be a little bit more difficult but
let's start from the bottom and work our
way up so we know that negative 100,000
x is a term that means that negative
100,000 itself is not a term on its own
so that means that it's not a variable
term or a constant term since it's part
of a term you learn more about parts of
terms in the next lesson we also know
that since this is a number and its
value is not going to very negative
100,000 is not a variable and in the
same way since its value is fixed it's a
constant it's just a number and since
it's a number that's multiplied by a
variable over here it's a coefficient so
negative 100,000 in this context is a
constant and a coefficient cool great
job working on all this vocab in your
first lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
