result of compiling the template which
means that this is a function and now
it's just waiting to be called with some
data that happens right here so let's
add a breakpoint and refresh the page to
see how it works the template function
is called with the models attributes we
can step into this function call by
clicking on this button here this takes
us back to underscore back to the
function we just built up data is the
information for the menu item remember
that render is the function that we
built up in the previous video the
render function is called and the models
data is passed to it let's step in to
render and see what's going on we are
now inside the function that was
constructed from the HTML template it
looks a little complicated but here's
the start of the TD and here is its
closing tag the content of the TD will
be an empty string if the property is
missing or it'll be the property itself
so these lines all form one big string
and are stored in p then p is returned
we can check p on the console to see
what is being returned or we can see
what this function returns over here
returning from this function takes us
back to template and from here we go
back to apt is finally after its long
arduous journey the template that's now
populated with data is inserted into
this element Wow all of that to compile
and render a template before we leave
underscore I need to mention one more
thing about variables and the way
they're referenced in templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
