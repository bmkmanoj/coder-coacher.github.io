and this is a matrix that takes a state
and when it multiplies with that state
spits out a measurement and remember we
can only directly measure position and
velocity so that's all we want the H
matrix to keep so again I want to talk
about the 2d lecture case and the 4d
homework case and hopefully by comparing
them we'll be able to build some
intuition and you'll be able to answer
the homework ok so what was the goal of
the H matrix the goal of the H matrix
let's take some state and in the 2d case
our state was represented as an X and X
dot multiply some matrix by that state
in such a way that we extract a
measurement and in the 2d case the
measurement was just X just the x
coordinates we can think of this as a 1
by 1 vector or 1 by 1 matrix and the
matrix we used to do that was this one
that was our H matrix 1 0 because 1
times X gives us the X 0 times X dot and
gives us nothing exactly what we want
but now let's talk about the
dimensionality of these matrices and how
this multiplication yielded just this
number X so well X here we can think of
as a 1 by 1 matrix and we got that
matrix if I'm multiplying this one which
is a 1 by 2 1 row by 2 columns with this
which is 2 rows by one column and what
we see here is that this one actually
came from right here and this one came
from right here and these twos we can
think of as cancelling out in a way
giving us this 1 by 1 matrix now let's
see if we can generalize that to the 4
dimensional case as presented in the
homework well in the 4 dimensional case
our state is now given by X Y X dot y
dot we're going to have some H matrix I
don't know anything about it yet but I'm
just going to put this there for now as
a placeholder and we got to want to get
a measurement from that and what should
this measurement be it's not just going
to be X because now our position
includes both X and
so it's going to be a column vector x
and y okay so again let's think what's
going on with the dimensionality here
here we have a two by one matrix and
that came from this matrix which I said
we don't know anything about yet so to
say question mark by question mark and
this matrix which is four rows by one
column now can you use the intuition we
built up here for how the dimensionality
of matrices works with this to fill in
the question marks I think once you
figure out the number of rows and the
number of columns in this H matrix
figuring out where to put your ones and
zeros will be a little bit easier I wish
you luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
