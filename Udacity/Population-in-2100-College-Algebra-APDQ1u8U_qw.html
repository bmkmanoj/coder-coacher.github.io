red graph here is 5.1 billion people and
our upper estimate which comes from this
blue curve is 36.1 billion there's such
a huge difference between these two
estimates and I think if we think about
all the different factors that affect
world population we can see why there's
so many things that influence the number
of people in the world for example we've
seen an increase in world population due
to decreasing death rates as people live
longer because of better health care in
the future we have no idea what's going
to happen maybe a pandemic will wipe
everyone out or maybe we'll have food
shortages due to climate change or
perhaps advances in science mean an
abundance of food and longer average
lifetimes who knows if you're interested
in this and I personally think it's a
pretty fascinating topic go to the
forums and talk about this with your
fellow classmates I think what this
illustrates is that even though we can
make models making long-term predictions
especially based on just equations can
be pretty difficult it's still however
worth discussing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
