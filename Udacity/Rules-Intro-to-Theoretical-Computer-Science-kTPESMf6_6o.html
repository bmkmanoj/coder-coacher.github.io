like you to do now is think about when
you analyze an algorithm using pen and
paper how would you go about that what
you basically say is you have your
program here and your variables here so
how do you get from here to here so
basically it's a number of rules that
look like this if we are at a certain
line of the code so say we are here and
usually that line of code will also use
some variables but it doesn't have to
but but usually it will of course so
certain variables are set to a given
value then we know what the program is
going to do next for example it is going
to jump to the next line of code and
it's going to modify this variable here
so how many of these rules here are
there well for a single line of code it
depends on the variables here and let's
assume that one line of code uses a
maximum of three variables if you were
to count how many of these rules there
are it's the number of different values
that one variable can take times the
number of different values that the
second variable can take times the
number of value set the third variable
can take so for one line of code that's
actually just o of one it's a constant
and why is that well because we said
that on the RAM variables cannot get
arbitrarily large so there's only a
constant number of different values that
a variable can take so even if we have
three different variables and consider
all of the combinations it will be a
huge number usually but it will be a
constant number for one line of code now
if we're not looking at one line of code
but all lines of code then this actually
doesn't change because we have a
constant number of possibilities for
each line in the code and the program
has constant size just as before so
there is a constant number of rules that
will tell us exactly what the machine is
going to do in the deterministic case
we're going to go to the
non-deterministic case in a minute
because there of course as we just found
out the if-then rules don't work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
