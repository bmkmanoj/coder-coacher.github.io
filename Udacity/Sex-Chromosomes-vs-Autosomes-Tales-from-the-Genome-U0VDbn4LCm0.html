so much smaller than the X chromosome
and there is an amazingly cool story
behind all of this please go read about
it it's amazing it's been going on for a
long time the Y chromosome has been
getting smaller and smaller for the last
oh I don't know a hundred million years
or so but the result has had dramatic
implications for genes that are
expressed from the X chromosome and that
don't exist on the Y chromosome think
about it for a second let's say we're
interested in this gene that causes
red-green color blindness and it's on
the X chromosome
well females have two X chromosomes so
anytime we're looking at their
inheritance patterns it's pretty much
the same thing and straightforward as
we've ever looked at for the autosomes
because females have two copies they
have two alleles that can be homozygous
they can be heterozygous they could be
plus plus plus minus or minus minus and
four recessive traits when they're
homozygous recessive then they're gonna
show the trait let's say for red-green
color blindness but for the sake of it
let's say that the female is
heterozygous dominant recessive so
they're not actually red-green color
blind but they carry an allele for it
males don't have that luxury
it's almost like the females have a
backup copy functioning copy of the
genes so they aren't red-green color
blind but males sure they have one X
chromosome the Y chromosome is missing
the piece of information that would
correlate to the same region on the X
chromosome they don't have this gene so
if the male has the dominant copy great
he's gonna see color vision just fine
but if he inherits even just one allele
one recessive allele for red-green color
blindness that's all it takes he doesn't
have anything to counteract the effect
and so he's going to be red-green
colorblind so in our pedigree up at the
top here we have an affected
great-grandfather and if he is XY we
know that he has an affected allele if
he has any daughter he must pass that
allele on because both daughters are xx
they get one extra momma one X from dad
and the X that came from dad had to have
been the one with the recessive allele
so both of these daughters are carriers
they have to be because we know they're
unaffected see they're not shaded that
means they're not red green
blind they must have gotten the
recessive allele from their father and
then if we look at this individuals
children here these two she had an
unaffected daughter we have no idea if
she passed on the recessive allele or
not because it's masked but in the case
of her son we see very clearly he must
have the recessive allele because he's
affected
so although the trait looks like it's
skipped a generation right it looks like
it went from grandfather to grandson the
allele didn't skip anybody the allele
went right from grandfather to mother to
son you can see it you can track it in
the pedigree so the lesson from all of
this is that although phenotypes appear
to skip generations sometimes the
alleles never skip and in the case of
sex-linked traits when they're linked to
either the X or the Y chromosome because
there are some traits linked only to the
Y chromosome the patterns can be a
little bit more tricky to discern
because the males don't have another
copy to complement their X chromosome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
