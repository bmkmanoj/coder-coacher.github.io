year and they are in a place where they
can really select the ones that they
feel close affinity with believe in and
want to go with going forward so for
them it's really about a matter of it at
a very high level I think they look at
three categories the first category the
team they look at the team and they want
to be in a place where the investing
people that they say hey I want to work
with this entrepreneur for the next five
to seven years and beyond so you know do
they have good chemistry with the person
do they think they're the right team to
push the startup forward the second
category they look at is the market is
the market opportunity big is this
something really worth going after is
there a big problem to be solved here
and do I think there's a good match
between the team and the market
opportunity they're going after and the
third item is the product or the
technology or what the team has done so
far to actually showcase that there's a
chance that exceed on their vision so
those three things and in each place the
team the market the product investors
look at the slew of things and sometimes
they decide not to invest because they
think the market is not big enough or
the team is great but maybe don't have
the expertise maybe the product is too
early and they want to see more proof
points but those are the three big
buckets of items I think most investors
look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
