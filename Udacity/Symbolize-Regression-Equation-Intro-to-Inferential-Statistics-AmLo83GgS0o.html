where it hits the y-axis and at what
angle this angle is generally referred
to as the slope which is essentially the
amount that Y changes when X changes by
one unit
in other words when X moves one unit
from here to here Y changes from here to
here note that this is a positive
relationship and we want to find what's
the change in Y when x increases by one
unit that's the slope but remember in
the case of regression this line
represents how much Y is expected to
change when X changes by one unit
therefore when we write the equation for
this line we denote it by Y hat there
are many ways to symbolize the
y-intercept and slope you may have
learned the generic y equals MX plus B
which at least in the United States is
usually how it's taught that's where m
represents slope and B represents the
y-intercept but really we can symbolize
them any way we want the important thing
is that once we decide on how to denote
them you have to remember that and
continue to use that later we can also
write it like this because addition can
go in any direction 2 plus 3 is the same
as 3 plus 2 the slope times X plus the
y-intercept is the same as the
y-intercept
plus the slope times X sometimes one of
these the slope or the y-intercept might
be negative so it's just important to
keep that in mind as long as we keep
those negatives and positive signs
correct the order doesn't matter the
slope and y-intercept are called
regression coefficients and sometimes
when we use software to calculate the
regression line they'll present it in
this first way for this lesson we're
going to use B to symbolize the slope
and a to symbolize the y-intercept given
this what will be our generic equation
for the regression line select all that
