programming practice gem this is
optional material for students who would
like to gain a little more practice
programming and debugging and what
happens here will not influence your
grade in any way today's problem given a
list could be empty could be arbitrarily
long print all sub lists of that list
I'll give an example of what this means
in just a second if you prefer more math
the explanation for us this is the same
problem as given a set print all the
subsets for example suppose the input is
the three element list containing the
strings LM ecs and sba then we want the
output to include the empty list we
don't have any of them all of the lists
containing just one of them all of the
lists containing any pair of them and
then all of them and one way to think
about this is that you are throwing a
party or perhaps hosting a dinner and
you've invited your three friends LM ecs
and SBA who could show up well one
possibility is that no one shows up and
you eat alone that would be super sad
another possibility is that only your
first friend shows up or only the second
or only the third and then you have a
dinner for two it could be that any pair
of them show up you have a great time or
it could be that everyone shows up and
everything works out just as you'd hoped
so you can think of this as a guest list
for a party and you want to know what
are all of the possible combinations of
people who could actually attend in this
particular example we started with three
friends and ended up with eight
possibilities one two three four five
six seven eight totally optional quiz
that does not count for your grade if
the input list had five entries if you
invited five friends to your dinner
party how many possible subsets are
arrangements ranging from no one shows
up to everyone shows up would there be
fill in the blank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
