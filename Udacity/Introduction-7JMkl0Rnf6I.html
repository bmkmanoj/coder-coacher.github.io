to talk about the concept of coded
photography recall again the whole
pipeline of computational photography we
have illuminated seen that goes through
a series of different processes to be
able to capture the light to generate an
image now one concept we looked at was
how do we control different aspects of
this pipeline we looked at how to
control light the illumination sources
we also want to now start thinking about
how we can actually change things inside
a camera and the optics and such to be
able to generate new forms of images
this leads us to the concept of coded
photography we actually have looked at
some of these ideas briefly when we
talked about the concepts of epsilon
photography epsilon photography was when
we basically said let's take a series of
pictures of something just different in
one parameter now actually let's talk
about how we can create those changes in
the camera itself and the whole concept
of coded photography is basically being
able to put something in a camera that
will let us capture this information
right on the camera itself and all of
the variations that come in perhaps on
things like epsilon photography but done
on board on a camera we're going to talk
about how to modify cameras to support
this in principle and actually what you
learn about is again the whole principle
of coated photography through this
