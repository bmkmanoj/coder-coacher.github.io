and your instructor yarn well he lives
in Germany and so he can be here today
but we're really lucky to have a Leonard
Susskind here with us today and Leonard
Susskind is a theoretical physicist at
Stanford he just give a little bit of
information about your background well
I'm a human being I come from Earth I I
came from New York City I am a
theoretical physicist by profession I
think about things like black holes and
quantum field theory and elementary
particles and cosmology and I spend most
of my day doing that every single field
of physics uses differential equations
there's nothing that doesn't use
differential equations so yes I think a
lot about differential equations I don't
solve them very often they're kind of
hard to solve and I don't do a lot of
numerics with it but the mathematical
structure of differential equations is
terribly important to every branch of
physics every branch what do you mean
the same mathematical structure well
there are different kinds of
differential equations and they behave
differently there are wave equations
which describe waves moving along there
are diffusion equations the diffusion
equation describes how I a drop of ink
that falls into some water okay how does
the drop of ink diffuse throughout the
water it doesn't make waves it just
grows and becomes a blob those are two
very very different kinds of
differential equations there are
differential equations that describe
electrostatic fields for example then
electrostatic fields don't change with
time so those are differential equations
that don't have to do with time they
just tell you how things vary in space
all these various differential equations
these different kinds of differential
equations have different kinds of
mathematical structure if an experienced
person looks in an equation a
differential equation
partial differential equation usually
you can tell very quickly is that
describing waves or it is describing
diffusion or is it describing the
electrostatic behavior of something and
you can get a pretty good feel by
looking at the equation by its
mathematical structure what kind of
phenomena is describing so yeah
different equations have different kind
of structure and the structure is
mathematical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
