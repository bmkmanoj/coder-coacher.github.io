calm and imagine that I am a user who
has difficulty reading small print now
naturally one thing I may do to help
with this is to zoom the page so let's
go ahead and we'll just zoom this page
up to about four hundred percent now an
interesting thing is going to happen
we're now viewing the mobile version of
the site on our desktop because the page
was designed responsively the UI has
rearranged itself for the smaller
viewport which is great for desktop
users who require screen magnification
and it's great for mobile screen reader
users since there are fewer elements to
touch and explore this is just a total
win in fact just by designing
responsibly we're meeting rule 144 of
the webbing checklist which states that
a page should be readable and functional
when the text size is doubled now going
over all of responsive design is way
outside the scope of this course
fortunately there is a separate Udacity
course just on this topic which you
should totally check out if you get a
chance I'll leave a link to this down in
the instructor notes but there are a few
important points which I did want to
cover which will be both important to
improve your responsive experience but
also to give your users better access to
your content the first of those is to
make sure that you're always using a
meta viewport tag and that you're
setting its width equal to device with
and its initial scale to 1 the meta
viewport tag gives the browser
instructions on how to control the pages
dimensions and it's scaling by setting
width equal to device width we're
telling the viewport to match the
screens with in device independent
pixels and by setting initial scale
equal to 1 we're establishing a
one-to-one relationship between CSS
pixels and device independent pixels
doing this will instruct the browser to
fit our content to the screen so that
the user doesn't just see a bunch of
scrunched up text now one thing to note
when using the viewport tag make sure
you don't force max scale to 1 or set
user scalable to know this is a bit of
an anti-pattern because it prevents
users from easily pinching to zoom the
content of the page which is useful if
you have a hard time reading
smaller text so be mindful of this one
the next technique is to make sure that
you're designing with a responsive grid
as I demonstrated with the Udacity site
designing with a grid means your content
will reflow when the page changes its
size so this is great for you know
working on mobile devices but it's also
great for those of us who need to zoom
the page in order to read smaller text
content oftentimes these layouts are
produced using relative units like
percents ms and REMS instead of
hard-coded pixel values the advantage of
using relative units is that text and
content can enlarge and force other
items down the page so the dom order and
the reading order remains the same even
if the layout is changing because of
magnification now you might also
consider using relative units like em or
REM specifically for text size instead
of pixel values as some browsers support
resizing just the text in a page via a
user preference setting if you're using
a pixel value for text it may not zoom
when that setting is turned on if
however you've used relative units
throughout the text should update to
reflect that user setting lastly when
your design is displaying on a mobile
device you need to ensure that your
interactive elements like buttons or
links have touch targets that are large
enough and have enough space around them
to make them easy to press without
accidentally overlapping on to other
elements this benefits all of your users
but is especially helpful for anyone
with a motor impairment a minimum
recommended touch target size is around
48 device independent pixels on a site
with a properly set mobile viewport the
48 by 48 pixel area corresponds to
around nine millimeters which is the
same size as someone's finger pad so in
this case I've got two buttons here and
this top one is actually about 40 pixels
the one below it is about 24 pixels so
to get up to this 48 device independent
pixel range what i can do is i can add
some additional padding to each of these
to make sure that their final touch
target size meets this requirement now
touch targets should also be spaced
about 32 pixels apart both horizontally
and vertically so that a user's finger
pressing on one touch target will not
inadvertently overlap on to another one
so while this icon here has a touch
target area of 48 by 48 I'm also going
to ensure that it has 32 pixels of
margining around it to make sure that
it's not overlapping with this other
interactive element over here following
this set of guidelines will go a long
way to ensure your experience is both
easy to interact with and accessible
regardless of the device size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
