called partitioning the input domain so
we're gonna start with some software
under test and it's going to have a set
of possible inputs and input domain and
of course this input domain usually
consists of so many possible test cases
that there's no way we can possibly test
them all speaking historically what
people have often been interested in is
ways to partition the input domain for a
piece of software under test into a
number of different classes so that all
of the points within each class are
treated the same by the system under
test and while constructing these
classes were allowed to look at the
implementation of the software we're
allowed to look at the specification
we're allowed to use even our vague
suspicions that we have we can use
anything we want in order to create
these partitions so for example we'll
have a some some subset of the input
domain for purposes of finding defects
in the system under test any point
within that subdomain is as good as any
other point with a nut subdomain
so basically when testing the system we
just pick an arbitrary point execute the
system on it look at the output and if
it's acceptable then we're done testing
that class of inputs so obviously in
practice sometimes this partition is
gonna fail and by fail I mean that this
thing that we thought was a class of
inputs that are all equivalent with
respect to the system under to test
isn't really and in fact there was a
different class hiding within this class
which triggers a bug even though the
original test case didn't and so when
that happens we can sort of blame the
partitioning scheme we can say that we
improperly partition the input the
problem with this sort of scheme is that
we can always blame the partitioning and
the unfortunate fact is is the original
definition of this partitioning scheme
didn't really give us extremely good
guidance in how to actually do the
partitioning all it said was we had to
do it in practice this sort of scheme
hasn't worked out for large systems
under test we're talking complex
software like real-time embedded systems
or operating systems or other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
