no longer submit to ASCII Chan I submit
something but we're only seeing the
cached page so so here's what happened
what we did is we made a request to
ASCII Chan who made a query to the
database which came back with a response
and then ASCII Chan store that result of
that query in a cache so now we've got
all of our artwork in our cache and we
use the data in that cache to send the
result back to the user now when we
submitted a new piece of art to ASCII
Chan we wrote that art to the database
and then we redirected the user back to
the front page the user then requested
the front page again at which point
ASCII Chan said ah well the data is
already in the cache I don't need to
check the database and return the value
from the cache again straight to the
user without the new value this is a
problem it means now submissions are
still working they're going to the
database but because of the new cache
that we added all of our requests are
bouncing off the cache and the cache
isn't getting updated which is resulting
in it appearing as though submissions
are broken which brings us to our next
quiz how can we fix our stale cache
problem and stale cache of course refers
to the fact that our cache is stale we
submitted new content to our database
and our cache is now out of date that's
referred to as having a stale cache
should we improve our cache to
automatically expire things after some
time after we submit should we just
clear the cache or after we submit
should we update the cache or don't
cache at all it's not going to work and
we should find a different solution
there are multiple good answers in here
check all of them that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
