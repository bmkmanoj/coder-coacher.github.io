earnings we're going to start by writing
down the initial total future earnings
we had so this is our baseline this is
what we start out with and now I'm going
to show how these two changes affect the
equation the first thing that happens is
that mr. Belvedere triples the amount of
money that grant will eventually make
off of these first orders so that means
we need to multiply this quantity 84 w +
60 n by three so I'm going to put
parentheses around it and write a three
out front great then the second step is
that a school orders one set of wipers
and one pair of nozzles for each of its
150 students so that means that for one
student the school wants one wiper set
and two nozzles into a pair of nozzles
and we know that one wiper set costs w
dollars so for one student the school is
going to pay w plus the cost for the two
nozzles which we know is to n so the
school plays w plus 2n for every student
however they have 150 students to pay
for that means that the amount the
school will pay is 150 times W plus 2 n
so this is our final equation the
updated total future earnings will be
equal to 3 times the quantity 84 w + 60
n and then added on to that 150 times W
plus 2n to account for the orders from
the school so looking back at the quiz
that you took and sorry I left out the
word total from the quiz these are the
same quantity so we need to figure out
which of these four choices corresponds
with or is equal to this expression up
here in the correct answer is this
fourth choice now this doesn't look
exactly like this equation number for
number and that's because the 150 has
been distributed to the two terms inside
the parentheses so if we do that we keep
the first part of the expression the
same and then i just multiply 150 by
each of the terms in the parentheses
just like you did with all of your
practice using the distributive property
150 times W is just 150 w + 150 times 2n
is 300 n so that's why the final answer
is the correct choice great now we're
one step closer to giving grant a very
nice and easy to use equation for the
amount of money he's going to earn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
