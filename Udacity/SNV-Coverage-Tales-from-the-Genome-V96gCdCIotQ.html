at for individual snv's in the genome
but now let's imagine that we expand our
comparisons from just for smbs to 1
million snv's across the genome then we
have a lot more statistical power behind
our numbers the snv's that 23andme uses
for genome comparisons are spread all
over the chromosomes in the genome the
autosomes the sex chromosomes and the
mitochondrial chromosome once the snv's
have been determined for an individual
then we can actually determine the IBS
score between any two people sampling
from a million positions in the genome
now you may be surprised to find that
the IBS score if we measure over a
million snv's the IBS score between you
and the most distantly related person we
could find around the world you would
still have an IBS score of about seventy
percent even after looking at all these
positions seventy percent of them would
be identical with another person the
person that you're most distantly
related to now this is when we focus
specifically on the snv's the single
nucleotide variants regions of the
genome that we know and expect there to
be variation remember that human genomes
though are already more than ninety nine
percent identical so even though we're
sampling from regions that we know
should be different and in general we do
find differences between humans here
humans just aren't that different from
each other and the IBS score between you
and most humans will be about seventy
percent or higher so if the background
IBS score for you and the most distantly
related person is about seventy percent
then I want you to assume minimal and
breeding and tell me what you would
expect your IBS score to be between you
and one of your biological parents about
70 75 85 95 or a hundred percent I want
you to pick the answer that you think is
best and then tell me why in this text
