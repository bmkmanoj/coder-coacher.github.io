decidable the ram runs at least a
million steps before terminating and to
do that well you just run the program
and count how many steps it takes if it
takes at least a million steps then we
know that it will take at least a
million steps before terminating we
don't actually need to know whether or
not it terminates to answer this
question we just need to know that it
runs at least a million steps before
that might happen the ram runs at least
a million steps and will eventually
terminate that is not decidable and the
reason for that is that in order to
answer this question we do need to know
whether the program eventually
terminates unlike this first question in
order to answer that we need to answer
the general question of whether program
will terminate which we've discussed in
the unit is actually undecidable in
general so this is not decidable now
this final statement is decidable and
it's decidable in much the same way that
the first statement is the ram runs at
most a million steps before terminating
won't simply count the number of steps
it takes and then answer the question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
