improve the ILP of the program is three
height reduction let's consider a
program that looks like this let's say
that we need a sum of these four
registers in r8 one way to get that is
to add the first two numbers into r8 and
then add the second number and then add
the third number and then the fourth
number however this forms a dependence
chain because we have the dependence
here and the dependence here so really
these instructions have to be done one
after the other so tree height reduction
works as follows the compiler figures
out that instead of adding one number at
a time to the sum and thus creating a
chain of dependencies what we can do is
we can group the computation this way
thus getting we first are the first two
numbers and put that in our eight then
we are the second pair of numbers put
that in our seven and then we add up the
r8 and r7 into our final result all
right
the dependencies here are this and this
so now we have two instructions that can
execute in parallel with each other
because they don't depend on each other
and then a third instruction that does
depend on them too so if this needed
three cycles to execute this can
actually execute in two cycles if we
have a processor that can do at least
two instructions per cycle tree height
reduction cannot always be done it uses
associativity of the addition operation
and you have to keep in mind that not
all operations are associative so we
have to be careful we can only do this
when the final result is the same as if
we did things in the proper order let's
say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
