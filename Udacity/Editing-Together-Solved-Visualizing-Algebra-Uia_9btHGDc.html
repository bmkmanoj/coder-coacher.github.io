film and Carlos would only need four
hours great thinking if you found these
two answers will start solving this
equation by multiplying through by the
LCD two and four tenths times X times X
plus 2 the product of these three
denominators when we multiply through by
the LCD we can simplify each of the
terms the first term reduces to 2 and 4
tenths times X plus 2 the second term
reduces to 2 and 4 tenths times X and
the last term simply reduces to x times
X plus 2 we distribute two and four
tenths to get these two terms and we
distribute X to get these two terms next
we combine 2 and 4 10 sex &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 4 10
SEC's to get four and eight tenths times
X now to clear these decimals I'm going
to go ahead and multiply through by a
factor of 10 when we multiply through by
10 we'll get 48x48 10 x squared + 20 X
now we're ready to move these two terms
to the right hand side of our equation
so we can get 0 on the left side and a
quadratic expression on the right-hand
side now we're ready to divide this
equation by 2 since all of these
coefficients are even when we divide
each of these terms by 2 will get this
new equation now we can factor when we
use factoring by grouping we get the
factors 5x plus 6 and X minus 4 we set
each factor equal to 0 and then we can
solve for the values of x x can equal
positive 4 or X can equal negative six
fifths we know X to the amount of time
it takes for Carlos to edit the film so
it would take him for hours we don't use
this choice since its negative that
wouldn't make sense with our concept of
time so since it takes Carlos for hours
it must take Melissa six hours we know
this is true since X was for which is
the amount of time it takes Carlos and
Melissa was X plus 2 two more hours than
Carlos if you're ever unsure go back to
the original problem we knew Carlos's
time was represented by X so he would
take four hours to edit the film Melissa
takes two hours longer than Carlos so
that means she needs six hours in order
to edit the film
I know this one was tough so great work
if you got it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
