and classes are reference types this is
in fact the principal difference between
these complex objects okay so what r
value types and reference types when a
value type is assigned to a variable or
a constant it's copied an entirely new
instance is created when a reference
type is assigned to a variable or a
constant there's no copy a new reference
to the original instance is created this
is definitely challenging to wrap one's
brain around but a couple examples
should clear things up let's go back to
our picture frame struct will declare an
instance of the picture frame struct and
call it frame creative I know here I'm
initializing frame as a three by five
picture frame with a half inch thickness
now we'll assign another variable frame
for mom my mom always needs more picture
frames will assign frame for mom to be
equal to frame but mom needs a five by
seven frame so we'll need to reset the
dimensions of frame for mom now my
question for you is what is the width
and height of frame I'll give you a few
seconds to think about it we can see in
the sidebar that the dimensions of frame
are still three by five when frame was
assigned to frame for mom an entirely
new copy was made the values five and
seven are held by the copy room for mom
the values three and five are held by
the copyrighted by frame what if picture
frame were a class here's a nearly
identical class i'm calling it classy
picture frame down here i'm
instantiating a classy picture frame
called classy frame and setting its
width and height two three by five and
like I did before I'm creating another
variable called classy frame for mom and
assigning it to be equal to classy frame
but of course mom needs five by seven
frames and again we ask ourselves what
will be the width and height of classy
frame and over here in the sidebar we
see five by seven but we never changed
the dimensions of classy frame how did
that happen classes are reference types
so when classy frame was assigned to
classy frame for mom no copy was made
instead a new reference was made this
means that classy
frame and classy frame for mom both
refer to the same instance here we're
changing the value of the underlying
instance to five by seven and both
references are affected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
