directly to the wire and receive a
response from the server just at the
server sended it feels raw close to the
bare metal doesn't it like there's
almost no software between us and the
bytes being sent and yet there's still
so much happening that we can directly
see and it actually has a big impact on
how fast the entire request response
process is if you are a little familiar
with networking architecture you might
know that HTTP is not the entire story
that's merely the protocol for a more
complete picture we are using HTTP on
top of TCP on top of IP on top of
Ethernet probably mostly maybe the point
is we don't need to understand each of
these layers but TCP in particular has a
big impact on how we should structure
our requests to have them perform well
and it warrants a closer look the
internet protocol allows us to talk to
other machines on the internet while TCP
allows us to have multiple independent
streams of data between these two
machines these dreams are distinguished
by port numbers the TCP protocol also
ensures that no packages get lost and
that they arrive in the right order all
of this requires precautions that cost
time and resources opening a new
connection is especially costly as the
TCP handshake which makes sure both
machines are aware of the newly created
communication channel has to be executed
that requires two round-trips if you are
using HTTPS the additional TLS handshake
has to be executed as well if HTTPS and
TLS are new to you stick around and
we'll talk about them in the next lesson
once all that is done the actual HTTP
protocol can finally take over head of
line blocking is a huge bottleneck to
website performance browsers being able
to open up six parallel connections
helps but it's not great later we'll see
how hb2 fixes issues with head of line
blocking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
