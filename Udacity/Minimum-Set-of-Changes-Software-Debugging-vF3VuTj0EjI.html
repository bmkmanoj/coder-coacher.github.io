program if we invoke HTML markup with s
being a single quote followed by less
than sign it passes however if it's a
double quote followed by a less than
sign it failed so this difference in the
original input determines whether the
run passes or fails let's go and execute
the program a bit further but stop
execution when the loop head is reached
for the second time now again we can
examine the state the variable s stays
unchanged at this point the character c
is still the first character being
processed which is different in the
passing run it's a single quote in the
failing run it's a double quote the
variable tag is false in both cases the
variable quote is different in the
passing run it is false in the failing
run it is true in the passing run the
out variable contains a single quote
whereas in the failing run the out
variable is empty what you see at this
point is that for variables namely s see
quote and out all have different values
you can now imagine that if we were in
the passing run and we would set these
four variables to the values found in
the failing run then we would
effectively make the passing run a
failing run meaning that these four
variables which defer make up a cause
for the failure however it suffices to
set only a subset of these variables to
the values found in the failing run only
a subset of these variables need to be
changed in order to cause the assertion
to fail and therefore the entire run to
fail so here's a quiz which of these
four variables can be set to values from
the failing run to make the passing
fail is it s is it C is it quote is it
out or is it a combination of multiple
variables hint if you set all for this
is a correct answer but I what I want is
a minimum set of variables over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
