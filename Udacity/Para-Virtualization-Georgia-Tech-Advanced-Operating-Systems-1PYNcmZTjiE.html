modify the source code of the guest
operating system if we can do that not
only can we avoid problematic
instructions as I mentioned earlier with
full virtualization but we can also
include optimizations for instance
letting the guest operating system see
real Hardware resources underneath the
hypervisor access to real Hardware
resources and also being able to employ
tricks such as page coloring exploiting
the characteristics of the underlying
hardware it is important to note however
that so far as the applications are
concerned nothing is changed about the
operating system because the interfaces
that the application see is exactly the
interfaces provided by the operating
system if this is an application that is
running on Windows it sees the same API
if the application is running on top of
Linux it sees exactly the same API as it
would if this Linux operating system was
running on native hardware in this sense
there's no change to the applications
themselves but the operating system has
to be modified in order to account for
the fact that it is not running on bare
metal but it is running as a guest of
the hypervisor and this is why this
technology is often referred to as para
virtualization meaning it is not fully
virtualized but a part of it is modified
to account for being a guest of the
hypervisor the Xen product family uses
this para virtualization approach now
this brings up an interesting question I
said that in order to do this para
virtualization we have to modify the
operating system but how big is this
modification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
