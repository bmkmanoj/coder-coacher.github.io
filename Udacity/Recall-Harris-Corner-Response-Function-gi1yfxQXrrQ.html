description of how to look for corner or
responses of corners in an image and we
looked at this diagram and again
basically this is showing you in the two
different eigenvalues that if the
eigenvalue one is larger than the
eigenvalue to a smaller this is the kind
of a shape you get if both of them
smaller this is what you get if I can
value second one is larger this is the
shape you get and of course I mean both
of them are larger this is the shape
again of course this is the corner so
we're looking for mostly corners this
would be an edge this would be an edge
and this would just be a our threshold
at Point we also looked at details of
how we can actually now just if we know
the second moment matrix we can actually
compute all of this from the straight
from the second moment matrix and we
actually did look a determinant of this
matrix and trace and actually just comes
out to the simple calculation and we use
a small weight factor a constant guard
to help us do this calculation so if you
notice here
rahrr which basically is giving us this
information about what is a corner or
not it's only dependent on the
eigenvalues of the moment second moment
matrix making it larger when it score a
corner negative with large magnitude for
an edge and small or the magnitude of
the R would be small and that's what we
have this region would be so again we
can do all of this without any explicit
computations of the eigenvalues because
we know how to compute the M straight
from the image by just doing the
derivatives and then using the gradient
computation to help us get there which
actually is an efficient way of doing
these kinds of things and again this is
one of the reasons this kind of stuff
can be done quite efficiently in you
know most simple computers again
remember this was the equation that now
we just have to compute and we can
actually do this on a neighborhood with
just image intensities and the
derivatives of Mitch intensities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
