some of you may be able to read all of
the columns and for some of you it might
be a little difficult or frustrating
especially as we get further over to the
right here and what you're looking at is
a range of contrasts and above each
column I've placed a contrast ratio
which is the relationship between the
foreground color and the background
color in terms of luminance when the
colors are very similar we have a low
contrast ratio when the colors are very
different we get a high contrast ratio
in section 1 dot 43 the webbing teclas
recommends a minimum contrast ratio of
4.5 to one for all body text and images
an exception is made for larger text
text that's about 120 or 150 percent
larger than the default body copy for
that larger text the ratio can go down
to 31 the contrast ratio of 4.5 to one
was chosen as a minimum because it
compensates for the loss in contrast
sensitivity usually experienced by users
with 2040 vision and 2040 vision is
commonly reported as the typical visual
acuity for someone of around 80 years of
age so looking at our columns of text we
can see that really only these first two
columns would pass for acceptable body
copy the third one here is just a little
too low on the contrast scale and this
last one is far too light now I
mentioned that these are contrast
minimums so while they might work well
for someone who has lost a bit of vision
as they age they will not necessarily
work well for all users especially those
who suffer from a low vision impairment
for users with low vision impairments or
color vision deficiencies we can
increase the contrast up to a ratio of 7
to 14 body copy and 4.5 to 14 larger
text looking again at our column so you
can see that really only this first
column would meet that criteria now
since most modern websites use a range
of type sizes and colors you're going to
need a way to quickly audit your page to
verify that you're meeting these
contrasts requirements to do this we can
use the chrome accessibility devtools
extension so what I'm going to do is
audit this page I'm going to open my dev
tools I'm going to go to the audits
panel and I'll run an accessibility
audit now I can see that the extension
is reporting a number of accessibility
air
all related to my anchor tags so let me
go inspect one of those anchor tags
right now click on this one right over
here I'll bump the font size up a little
bit so this is easier to read and when I
go and look at the accessibility
properties for this item I'm presented
with a number of options here first I
see a warning indicating that my
contrast is just too low and then I see
options for minimum and enhanced
contrast now the nice thing is that the
hex values are right here so I can just
copy these into my stylesheet if I want
but one really cool feature of the
devtools extension is that I can click
on these swatches and see the anchor
tags update in the document so i can see
here for instance that that is what the
enhanced colors would look like in my
application now in the next lesson I'm
going to have you audit a page using
this same extension so that way you can
fix up any errors that you find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
