some of you may be able to read all of
the columns and for some of you it might
be a little difficult or frustrating
especially as we get further over to the
right here and what you're looking at is
a range of contrast and above each
column I've placed a contrast ratio
which is the relationship between the
foreground color and the background
color in terms of luminance when the
colors are very similar we have a low
contrast ratio when the colors are very
different we get a high contrast ratio
in section 1 dot 4.3 the webbing
checklist recommends a minimum contrast
ratio of 4.5 to 1 for all body text and
images an exception is made for larger
text text that's about 120 or 150
percent larger than the default body
copy for that larger text the ratio can
go down to 3 to 1 and the contrast ratio
of 4.5 to 1 was chosen as a minimum
because it compensates for the loss in
contrast sensitivity usually experienced
by users with 2040 vision and 2040
vision is commonly reported as the
typical visual acuity for someone of
around 80 years of age so looking at our
columns of text we can see that really
only these first two columns would pass
for acceptable body copy the third one
here is just a little too low on the
contrast scale and this last one is far
too light now I mentioned that these are
contrast minimums so while they might
work well for someone who has lost a bit
of vision as they age they will not
necessarily work well for all users
especially those who suffer from a low
vision impairment for users with low
vision impairments or color vision
deficiencies we can increase the
contrast up to a ratio of 7 to 1 for
body copy and for 0.5 to 1 for larger
text looking again at our column so you
can see that really only this first
column would meet that criteria now
since most modern websites use a range
of type sizes and colors you're going to
need a way to quickly audit your page to
verify that you're meeting these
contrast requirements to do this we can
use the chrome accessibility dev tools
extension so what I'm going to do is
audit this page I'm going to open my dev
tools I'm gonna go to the audits panel
and I'll run an accessibility audit now
I can see that the extension is
reporting a number of accessibility
all related to my anchor tags so let me
go inspect one of those anchor tags
right now click on this one right over
here I'll bump the font size up a little
bit so this is easier to read and when I
go and look at the accessibility
properties for this item I'm presented
with a number of options here first I
see a warning indicating that my
contrast is just too low and then I see
options for minimum and enhanced
contrast now the nice thing is that the
hex values are right here so I can just
copy these into my stylesheet if I want
but one really cool feature of the dev
tools extension is that I can click on
these swatches and see the anchor tags
update in the document so I can see here
for instance that that is what the
enhanced colors would look like in my
application now in the next lesson I'm
gonna have you audit a page using this
same extension so that way you can fix
up any errors that you find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
