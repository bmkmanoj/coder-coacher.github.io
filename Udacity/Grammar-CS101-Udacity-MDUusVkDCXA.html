we need to learn new language this will
be a way to describe what we want the
computer do in a much more precise way
than we could in a natural language like
English and it's a way to describe
programs that the Python interpreter
can run one of the best ways to learn a
programming language is to just try
things you can try that in the Python
interpreter that's running in your
browser let's for example try running
print 2 + 2 + in English
someone could probably guess that the
value of 2 + 2 + should be 4 in Python
when we try writing this we get an error
and the reason we get an error is that
this is not actually part of the Python
language the Python interpreter only
knows how to evaluate code that's part
of the Python language if you try to
evaluate something that it's not part of
the Python language it will give you an
error errors look a bit scary the way
they print out but there's nothing bad
that can happen it's perfectly okay to
try running code if it producing an
error that's one of the ways to learn
about programming the error we got here
is what's called a syntax error that
means that what we tried to evaluate is
not actually part of the Python language
like English Python has a grammar that
defines what strings are in the language
in English we can make lots of sentences
that are not completely grammatical and
people still understand them but there's
some underlying grammar behind the
language those of you who are native
English speakers might have learned
rules like this in what was once called
grammar school those of you who learned
English as a second language probably
learned rules like this when you were
learning English so English has a rule
that says you can make a sentence by
combining a subject with a verb followed
by an object almost every language has a
rule sort of like this the order of the
subject and the verb and the object
might be different but there's a way to
combine those three things to form a
sentence the subject could be a noun the
object could also be a noun and then
each of these parts of speech well we
have lots of things that could be so a
verb could be the word eat a verb could
also be the word like and there are lots
of other words that the verb could be a
noun could be the word I and noun could
be the word Python a noun could be the
word cookies the actual English grammar
is of course much larger and more
complex than this
but we can still think of it as having
rules like this that allow us to form
sentences from the parts of speech that
we know from the words that make those
parts of speech the way we're writing
grammars here is the notation called
Backus Northland and this was invented
by John Backus so John Backus was the
lead designer of the Fortran programming
language
back in the 1950s at IBM this was one of
the first widely used programming
languages and the way they describe the
Fortran language was with lots of
examples and text explaining what they
meant and this is a shot from the actual
manual for the first version of Fortran
this works okay many programs were able
to understand it and guess correctly
what it meant but was not nearly precise
enough and when it came time to design a
later language which was the language
called Algol it became clear that this
informal way of describing languages
wasn't precise enough and John Backus
invented the notation that we're using
here to describe languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
