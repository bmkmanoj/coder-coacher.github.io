quantitative or qualitative quantitative
traits vary continuously over a range of
measurements and display in statistics
what we call a normal distribution or
bell curve we've already talked about
one of these breast cancer risk good
examples of this are things like height
or weight you can see that measurements
for height vary continuously over a
range and that we have an average height
but there's a spectrum for all other
possible Heights everybody has these
traits but they vary in their quantities
on a continuous spectrum you could be
five feet tall you could be six feet
tall anywhere in between
now qualitative traits don't have this
quantitative aspect instead qualitative
traits are said to vary discontinuously
they measure the presence or absence of
something maybe a category that
something falls into for example you may
be right or left-handed or maybe
ambidextrous which is a mix of both but
we typically don't quantify a trait like
this you either right handed or you're
not now some of you more advanced
learners out there may take issue with a
sort of simple categorization here but
this is very useful in research being
able to categorize traits as
quantitative or qualitative and then
measure them accordingly allows us to
plan and carry out research that can
correlate with various outcomes so let's
look at the polygenic trait of eye color
polygenic remember meaning that it's
influenced by multiple genes suppose we
classify everyone based on whether they
have brown eye color green eye color
blue eye color will this be an example
of a quantitative or qualitative trait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
