why let's look at the blue code first
when we start the value is 100 we go to
the loop value is greater equal than 100
in fact we've said it to make sure we
enter the loop we asked the user to
enter a value let's say the user is
uncooperative and enters 200 then we go
back up now the value is still greater
equal than 100 and we go back in the
loop that was the whole purpose really
off this while loop we wanted to keep
asking the user while the value is
greater equal than 100 since our target
is to get a value less than 100 remember
the while condition is always the
opposite of the target so now I'd say
the user is doing better
Andras 99 I'll go back to the top of the
loop 99 is less than 100 and we fall
through so it worked so this one was a
good solution now let's look at the
black solution this one is a little
different we asked the user to enter a
value less than 100 and let's say they
do then now comes the loop this loop is
never entered and in this case we get
the right behavior so let's look at
another situation where the user doesn't
makes a mistake first so away again at
the top we ask the user to enter a value
less than 100 the user enters 200 now
that's greater equal within 100 so now
we get into the loop and we ask the user
again and say now they give the right
answer then we go back to the top and
now we're satisfied so this also works
but both of the solutions are little
unsatisfactory look at the first one
here we have this trick where we are
setting this value to an artificial
value not to a user input so that we
enter the loop the first time it's a bit
ugly the second one where you repeat
part of the code look at the statement
here and the statements here they're
exactly the same statements and we need
to repeat them because we first need to
get the user input before we can see
whether it's any good and then we need
to keep bugging the user until it's any
good that repetition is also somewhat
undesirable there is a Java statement
that can take care of this
