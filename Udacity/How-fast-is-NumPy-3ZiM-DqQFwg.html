operation in Python let's check how fast
numpy is let's define a really large
airing so that the time taken for the
operation will be significant to compare
so here is our large array of thousand
rows and 10,000 columns before I go
ahead I would like to mention that this
is just a demo code to show the speed of
numpy so I will be giving a high-level
explanation of this code moving ahead we
will be comparing how to compute mean of
the array using numpy and using standard
iteration here is the manual mean
function which computes the mean of the
values in the defined array we iterate
over each row and for each row iterate
over each column we then sum present all
the values throughout the array finally
we divide by the size of the array and
hence we get the mean in case of using
numpy for calculating the mean we just
write array dot mean to get the mean of
the entire array how long function we'll
just compute the time each method takes
now let's check what's the time
difference do you see the difference
this is the time taken by the numpy dot
mean function to calculate the mean of
the entire array and remember the size
of the array are in thousands on the
other hand the time taken by them manual
method of iteration is about 5 seconds
hence brute numpy is super fast we also
compute the rate of how fast the numpy
is and the numbers are crazy
it's about 290 times faster than the
manual for the loops observe that numpy
not only makes the code more cleaner as
compared to the manual method but is
about 290 times faster than other method
don't you think it's just awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
