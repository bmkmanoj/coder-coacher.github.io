dog is not a kind of house if you try to
store a dog in a variable that's made to
hold a house you'll get a compile-time
error which is good if java let you
store a dog in a house variable you
might then try to call house methods on
the dog and the dog wouldn't know how to
do them getting this error is actually a
good thing it means that Java is helping
us this is one of the things that we
were talking about when we mentioned
really early on that Java is a safe
language if java let you create a dog
and then store it as a house you might
try to live in it later and fail but
instead of doing that the compiler will
immediately tell you that there's
something wrong with your code other
languages might allow you to keep
running the code and then mysteriously
fail or return the wrong results this
third option isn't quite what we want
this is the error that you would get if
dog ran interface if you tried to make a
new drawable then you would get an error
like this error drawable is abstract
cannot be instantiated the drawable
interface has methods sort of but it
doesn't have enough detail about them
for Java to actually make an object
drawable for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
