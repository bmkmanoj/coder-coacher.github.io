MapReduce works in the next lesson we'll
talk about how to write the code to
perform these MapReduce jobs on your
cluster but before that let's go back to
the cluster just as we saw with HDFS
there are a set of Damons which is just
a piece of code running all the time
running on each of these machines there
were the data nodes and the name node
when you run a MapReduce job you submit
the job to what's called the job tracker
that splits the work into mappers and
reducers those mappers and reducers will
run on the other cluster nodes running
the actual map and reduce tasks is
handled by daemon called the task
tracker the task tracker software will
run on each of these nodes note that
since the task tracker runs on the same
machine as the data nodes the Hadoop
framework will be able to have the map
tasks work directly on the pieces of
data that are stored on that machine
this will save a lot of network traffic
as we saw each mapper processes a
portion of the input data that's known
as the input split and by default
Hadoop will use an HDFS block as the
input split for each mapper it will try
to make sure that a mapper works on data
on the same machine if this green block
for example needs processing then the
task tracker on this machine will likely
be the one chosen to process that block
that won't always be possible because
the task trackers on these three
machines that have the green block could
already be busy in which case a
different node will be chosen to process
the green block and it will be streamed
over the network this actually happens
rather rarely so the mappers will read
their input data they'll produce
intermediate data which the Hadoop
framework will pass to the reducers
remember that's the shuffle and sort
then the reducers process that data and
write their final output back to HDFS so
let's have an run a job on our cluster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
