prefer fresh method to load the
container and this takes see container
ID which you get from the tag manager UI
and the default container so this method
checks if the app has a container that's
been refreshed in the past 12 hours or
so and if it does then we load the
container and if there isn't a fresh
container then load a new one over the
network then if there's a timeout or
network error before the container
finishes loading then the container
holder status is set to unsuccessful
there are a couple of other methods for
loading the container load container
default only which will only get the
default container and then there's also
load container prefer non default so
this one prefers to not use the default
container but doesn't necessarily look
for a fresh container to get the
freshest value use load container prefer
fresh but fresh is a relative term if we
look at the reference page for tag
manager it says that the mobile app
refreshes the container from the network
every 12 hours so one of the benefits of
tag manager is that non developers can
upload changes to a nap and these will
often be bulk up loads of many values
this mechanism is not really meant for
second-by-second changes but it's nice
to see the changes when we're developing
our app and that's why we added the call
to manually refresh the container here's
the reference the Refresh method on
container and it says in order to limit
the frequency of network communication
refresh method is throttled and that
you're supposed to wait at least 15
minutes before calling this method again
so even manual refresh is are not
guaranteed to take effect more than
about every 15 minutes I've had good
luck with my changes taking effect very
quickly when I change variable values in
tag manager but it's not guaranteed if
you don't see the changes taking effect
immediately don't be too surprised</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
