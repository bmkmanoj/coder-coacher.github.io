it's a big list of links and users can
vote on those links up and down and the
front page is whatever is the most
popular and you know they can be voted
up or vote it down and and you know good
links stay at the at the top of you know
at the top of the page for a long time
and and in mediocre links may you know
make an appearance but disappear for a
while so that's a really cool feature of
Reddit and it's actually not that hard
to compute because what we do is we use
a special index I'll show you how that
works so we've got a table a link table
that looks something a lot like what
we've been dealing with it's got an ID
and it's got a number of up votes a
number of down votes and no date and it
also has this field called score it's a
floating point field and this is the
total score of the link so you may have
ten ups one down and score might be
actually 25 and the way that reddit hot
algorithm works is there's there's an
index on the score field you know it
used to just be called the hot index and
it was really just on uh on the score
field one approach to generating this
front page might be to take all the
links submitted in the last 24 hours do
some fancy math sort them by you know
how many up votes and down votes you
know the spread between these two votes
is and sort it that way but that doesn't
that doesn't really capture kind of that
hotness how things rise and fall so
every time like for example you add you
know one up vote we actually increment
the score by some other amount and this
other amount is computed through this
hot function and that hot function looks
something like this it's a hot function
it takes a number of ups the number of
downs so it can compute a total score
which is you know ups - downs and the
submission date of the link you know
this field and so what happens is over
time the value of an upvote increases so
an up vote today it might be worth one
point and that same up vote tomorrow on
the same link will be worth ten points
and what this causes is it causes our
scores to over time to be constantly
increasing so newer links always appear
always have higher scores than older
links so a link with you know that's one
day old with lots of votes has the same
popularity as a link that's one
minute old with just a few votes and
that's what keeps our front page
churning and it's really actually very
simple and it's a very fast square we
can do we can just say effectively
something like this select star from
links order by score descending and then
we get the hottest links on reddit and
this is a very simple and fast query
consult does this really just bounce off
the the hot index and it's neat you get
this really cool effect for not a lot of
cost now to be fair this took us a
little while to figure this out and we
actually the first version reddit you
know took the approach of taking all of
the links from the last 24 hours and
doing some math awning on them and
sorting them in memory but later one of
our guys came up with this notion of a
hot scorer and we can just convert that
into an index and there we go we've got
a database that keeps our links always
sorted in order in an order of hotness
you know whenever we need them so anyway
thought you might enjoy that let's move
