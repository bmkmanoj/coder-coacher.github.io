programming is the notion of a data type
which we also just call it type you've
been using type since your first program
so you already know a fair bit about
types we just haven't talked about it
explicitly until now understanding types
more deeply will make you a better
programmer we'll help you understand
more what's going on when your programs
run it will also get you to the point
where you can define your own data types
and that will be useful for making our
search engine code more modular like we
just talked about so first I want to
introduce some terminology everything
that you can reference in a Python
program is an object what does it mean
to be able to reference something well
that means we can give it a name there
are lots of ways to give things names
you could pass it as a parameter you
could use it in an assignment anything
that could be assigned to a name is an
object in Python every object has a type
we can think of types as sets of values
and the type of an object tells us
something about what we can do with it
there's an easy way to explore types in
Python and that's to use the built-in
type operator the type operator takes
any object as its input and produces as
its output the type of the input object
here's an example so here we're using
type to find the type of the object
which is the number 101 that's an object
we can reference it we could assign it
as a variable we could pass as a
parameter so it must have a type and it
has type int which is short for integer
what you might find a little more
surprising is we can do the same thing
with functions so we've defined the
function double that takes one input and
returns X plus X see if you can guess
what the type of double is before I
evaluate this it has type and it's type
is function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
