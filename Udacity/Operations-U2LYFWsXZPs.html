talking about the value of an attribute
and those are usually pretty
straightforward let's now talk about
operations ocl provides a way to specify
operations using pre and post condition
constraints these are different key
words in the language this case we're
going to look at requirement 3 which
describes some query operations now by
query operation I mean an operation that
is asking about the value of an
attribute but not changing anything so
in this case it should be
straightforward to have an operation
that returns that value so the
requirement itself says in addition at
any particular point in time the library
may need to know where to calculate the
items that patron has checked out when
they are due and any outstanding overdue
fines so let's concentrate on the part
about the items that a patron has
currently checked out so previously when
we did our analysis we associated this
text with an operation in class patron
called items currently checked out what
we need to do now is to say something
about that particular operation we need
to state it more precisely than just
saying that it exists in fact we have to
say that the value computed by this
operation corresponds to just those
items that are checked out for that
patron recall that we have a association
between patron and loanable item and
that Association is going to record what
items are checked out now we're talking
about the operation in patron so
essentially that operation is querying
the Association and we want to make sure
that what the operation returns is in
fact what's appropriately expressed in
the Association</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
