do for this course is to talk about how
these semantic networks can be used to
represent Ravens progressive matrices we
saw a few different problems in the
first lesson so take a look at how the
semantic networks we've talked about
today can be used to represent some of
those other problems and write your own
kind of representation scheme in
addition to writing a representation
scheme also talk about how that
representation scheme actually enables
problem solving remember what Ashok
mentioned about the different qualities
of a good knowledge representation
that's complete it captures information
at the right level of abstraction and it
enables problem solving so write about
how your representation can enable
problem solving of two by one two by two
and three by three problems you don't
need to use the exact same
representation scheme that we use and in
fact you can and should use your own
also remember that your representation
should not capture any details about
what the actual answer to the problem is
but rather it should only capture what's
actually in the figures in a particular
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
