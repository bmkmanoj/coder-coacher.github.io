how to deal with missing data both
deletion and imputation are relatively
easy to do however we've seen where
there can be issues with either approach
now depending on the business analysis
we could progress to more advanced
methods to deal with missing data and
while this is beyond the scope of the
class I'll just mention a couple that
you can explore on your own the first is
called multiple imputation this is where
you do the imputation process multiple
times using a method that will predict
the missing values typically by using a
regression of other variables and then
adding in some random error with these
multiple sets of data you create the
analytical model multiple times and then
basically blend those models together as
we've mentioned this is an advanced
method and is fairly sophisticated but
if our business question and results
could be significantly off by using a
simpler method you might want to explore
this option another advanced method is
called full information maximum
likelihood even the name is sort of
intimidating right here the missing
values aren't actually replaced but
they're handled within the modeling
process itself this only works for
certain types of models and will require
special software that can handle this
methodology again both of these are
beyond the scope of the course but I
wanted to make sure you are aware of
them for more information you can find a
