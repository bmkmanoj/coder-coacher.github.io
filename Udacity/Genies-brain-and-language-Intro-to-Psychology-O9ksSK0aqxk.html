finding using neural imaging researchers
found that when Jeannie was listening or
speaking the activity in her brain was
located mostly in the right hemisphere
now remember we just mentioned that
language comprehension and production is
located in the left hemisphere this led
researchers to suggest that the left
hemisphere speech development requires
stimulation from the environment during
what's called a sensitivity period if
it's to develop properly so sensitivity
periods are ages before which critical
stimulation in learning must occur
otherwise the window of learning will
close and it will become very difficult
to learn languages if you're interested
in learning more about this case study
the movie Mockingbird don't sing is
based on her life story although tragic
it demonstrates again how much we can
learn from human thought and behavior by
using case studies such as these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
