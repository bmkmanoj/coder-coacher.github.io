mutation can be introduced actually yes
there's another serious but less common
exposure to x-rays x-ray energy
radiation actually causes a Knick in the
DNA backbone cutting it into two pieces
essentially separating a chromosome into
two pieces it can be most of the time
your cells are able to immediately
attach the chromosome back together but
because it's such a big deal your cells
will try to attach it really quickly and
anything it can find remember there's
not a lot of space in your cells and the
DNA is packed really close together this
means that sometimes the chromosome
piece breaks off and gets attached to a
whole other chromosome like this so the
information is still preserved just
rearranged on two different chromosomes
exactly and we call this a translocation
but if all the information is still
there why is it a problem
well sometimes all the information turns
out is not there but even if it is think
of all the problems you could run into
with rearranged information let's take
this chromosome pair where there's one
gene and orange at the end and then
another chromosome pair where there's
this gene in pink at the end now let's
say there's a chromosome break in each
chromosome and it happens right in the
middle of the two respective genes and
just by sheer random chance now let's
say these chromosome pieces swap so the
genes landed exactly in frame with each
other's coding region what do you think
the most likely result will be let's
assume that everything swapped in frame
I want you to select the answer that you
think is best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
