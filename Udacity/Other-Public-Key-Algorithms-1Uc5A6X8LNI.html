diffie-hellman which are the most widely
used algorithms there are other public
key algorithms first the National
Institute of Standards and Technology or
NIST has published the digital signature
standard it is based on the secure hash
function sha-1 note that this algorithm
is only for signature is not for
encryption or key exchange RSA is the
most widely used public key cryptography
algorithm for encryption and digital
signatures listen Lee a competing system
called elliptic curve cryptography has
begun to challenge RSA the main
advantage of ECC over RSA is that it
offers the same security with a far
smaller bit size that is for the same
security strengths it can be much more
efficient than RSA on the other hand RSA
has been subject to a lot of crude
analysis work over the years well as for
ECC the crit analysis work is still at
the beginning therefore we are not as
confident in ECC as we are in RSA ECC is
more difficult to explain and the full
mathematical description is beyond the
scope of this course but briefly the
technique is based on the use of a
mathematical construct known as the
elliptic curve Rafi's speaking two
points P and T on the elliptic curve are
known or made public and P and T has the
following relations D times P Eko T
under the so-called point multiplication
and the factor D is the private key
mathematically even P and T which are
public it is very hard to find T which
is private</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
