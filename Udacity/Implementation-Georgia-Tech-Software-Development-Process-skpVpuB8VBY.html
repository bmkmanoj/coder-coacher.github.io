implement it in the implementation phase
that what we do is basically taking care
of realizing the design of the system
that we just created and create an
actual software system there are four
fundamental principles or pillars that
can affect the way in which software is
constructed the first one is the
reduction of complexity this aims to
build software that is easier to
understand and use the second pillar is
the anticipation of diversity which
takes into account that software
construction might change in various way
over time that is the software evolves
and in many cases it evolves in
unexpected ways and therefore we have to
be able to anticipate some of these
changes the third pillar is the
structuring for validation also called
design for testability and what this
means is that we want to build software
so that it is easily testable during the
subsequent validation and verification
activities finally and this is
especially true within specific
organizations and/or domains it is
important that the software conforms to
a set of internal or external standards
and some examples of this might be for
example for internal standards coding
standards within an organization or
naming standards within an organization
as for external standards if for example
you are developing some medical software
there are some regulations and some
standards that you have to adhere to in
order for your software to be valid in
that domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
