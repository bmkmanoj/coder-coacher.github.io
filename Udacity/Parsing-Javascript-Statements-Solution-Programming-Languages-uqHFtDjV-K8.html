to build a large portion of our
JavaScript parser in particular we're
first going to focus on JavaScript
statements and then make it even easier
really only going to consider six types
of statements if then so if you have an
if statement basically if then else so
here we're going to handle a JavaScript
statement something like this then also
an else whereas this first type of
statement is just this portion whereas
the if then else handles all of this
we're going to also do assignment so a
variable x equals say five return
statements an example of that in
JavaScript will look like this where are
we have the return keyword followed by
an expression here I just have five we
have two ones left one involving
decoration namely using the VAR keyword
so this declares a variable X and sets
of 25 verses just setting it to five
later on and the last type we're going
to handle in this portion is just the
existence of an expression you can have
in your JavaScript and expression in the
middle of your code so instead of stuff
here we could just say five this doesn't
know anything but it says the number
five and it's valid JavaScript so this
is pretty straightforward if you just
follow the rules that were given at the
top of the program and we're going to go
straight to the IDE and work through it
one by one so here i have my interpreter
ready for us to get started with this
question so here i have the role for a
function and we're going to write this
out here i'm telling the parser that
this is going to be a partial for the
element non terminal and i'm going to
call this one the function parser all
the first thing is going to be a string
that tells the parser when to apply this
rule but here i say an element's can go
to the terminal function and identifier
the left paren some optional parentheses
are right / end followed by a compound
sequence of statements and once this has
been matched I'm going to apply it such
that element is going to be the tuple
with the word function the name of the
function which is going to be the
identifier the optional parameter
which is number four and then six is
going to be the compound statements and
I only can also just be a statement
which is going to be some sort of
statement follow the by semicolon the
tuple that it matches is going to be the
word statement and the contents of that
statement here I have my two rules for
optional parameters and as the name
implies the parameters can be optional
so op params can go into nothing or it
can be a sequence of parameters now
parameters can be some kind of
identifier followed by a comma and more
parameters or it can be one or the last
parameter is just going to be an
identifier notice how i put the
identifier in a list because parameters
are always a list even if there's just
one thing in them a compound statement
is a sequence of statements in between a
left brace and a right brace ever and
out the rules for statements statements
can be empty so you can have nothing in
your between your left and right braces
or it can be a single statement and a
semicolon followed by more statements so
now we're going to define the statements
let's start with if if we do have an if
statement we're going to put it in a
tuple in our parse tree where the first
entry in the tuple is the string if then
to indicate that it's an if statement
the second one is going to be the
expression of the if statement and the
last element of a tuple are going to be
the compound statements that comprise
the then in the if-then-else we have
very similar structure except we've also
added an else which is going to be an
additional entry in or tuple that is the
sequence of statements that you do if
the expression is not evaluated to be
true here we have assignment it's going
to be an identifier say x equals the
equals sign and then some expression say
five and in our parse tree we want to
put a sign the identifier and then the
expression to which the identifier is
set for return we're just going to do
return and then the expression that we
are returning we use the keyword bar to
declare and set a variable so we're
going to have the keyword
bar followed by an identify or the equal
sign and expression in our parse tree
we're going to put var the identifier in
the expression so make this a little
more concrete it would be as if we were
doing this and the tuple that we put in
our parse tree is going to be VAR comma
x comma 5 and lastly we say a statement
can go to an expression which we haven't
defined yet and we're saving for the
next problem taken altogether we have
much of our JavaScript parser well at
the least the part that handles
statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
