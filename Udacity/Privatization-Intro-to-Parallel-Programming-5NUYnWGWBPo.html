Stratton's taxonomy is called
privatization so we're tiling exploited
the fact that multiple threads are
reading from the same memory locations
thread sharing input is good
privatization helps avoid having
multiple threads right to the same
output locations so privatization takes
some output data shared by multiple
threads and duplicates it so that
different parallel threads can operate
on their own private copy the private
copies are eventually merged together to
recreate the result that would have been
produced in the shared data using used
by all the threads before privatization
so histogram makes a good example as
you've learned from our previous
discussions and problem sets on
histogram there's a bunch of ways that
you could approach the problem in
particular you could program the kernel
to have each thread keep its own local
histogram as it looked at a bunch of
pixels and then use Atomics or a global
reduce operation to combine the buckets
from the histograms from all the threads
into one set of shared results you can
also apply this idea hierarchically for
example you can have each thread block
compute a combined histogram and shared
memory and then have other thread blocks
do the same and then accumulate the
results into a single global histogram
so in this example we would have per
thread privatized histograms and per
block privatized histograms now in
practice the GPU has so many threads
that you don't want each one have a huge
private data structure so this approach
might work well for a small histogram
say five or 10 buckets but you would
probably skip the per thread privatised
copies for histogram with hundreds of
buckets and just do the local version
per block</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
