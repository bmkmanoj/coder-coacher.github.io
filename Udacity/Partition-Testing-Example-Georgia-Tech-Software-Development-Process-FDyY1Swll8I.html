an example I'm going to use this simple
program that takes two inputs the first
input is a string STR and the second one
is an integer size and the problem is
called split and as the name says it
does is to take the string STR and split
it into substring into chunks of size
characters each so how do we identify
some possible partitions for this
program if we consider the input size we
can identify three natural partitions
which are size less than 0 for example
we want to test how the program behaves
if we pass an incorrect size size equal
to 0 which is also a partition in this
case a partition with a single element
and the third case is size greater than
0 which I will consider to be kind of
the standard case and actually let me do
is you know slight digression so when I
was talking about designer bias so this
is the case in which designer bias might
not make you think of using size less
than zero because you read the spec and
you sort of assume that the size will be
positive whereas the right thing to do
when we test it is to consider the
complete domain rather than just that
parts of it so now let's look at string
STR and let's see what kind of
subdomains we could identify for this
parameter notice another important
aspect here is that we treat each
different part of the input
independently which also helps breaking
down the problem one interesting sub
domain is the domain that includes all
the strings whose length is less than
size so all the strings they will not be
split another sub domain is all the
strings with length which is between the
value of size and twice the value of
size a third sub domain is the one
including all the strings whose length
is greater than twice the value of size
and we can really continue and identify
more and more sub domain the key thing
here is that we have to do that based on
the domain so we need to adapt what we
just did here based on on a specific
domain involve the n on the type of data
in this domain so at this point we said
that there were two steps one was to
identify the sub domains and the second
one was to pick values in these sub
domains the values that we actually use
for the testing in this case we do not
want to just pick any value rather we
want to pick values that are
particularly interesting particularly
representative so what does that mean
what we're going to do that based on
intuitive idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
