approaches to implementing
generalization in object oriented
languages one that we've just alluded to
his inheritance that follows specific
rules second you could just simply use a
single class that has some kind of flag
that indicates for their particular
instance is of a certain type and you
might have multiple types and the flag
could have multiple different different
values if you did that you would then be
hiding the child data for that
particular type inside that that that
class as indicated by the flag in Java
you could use interfaces or enews which
are two mechanisms that allow you that
enforce the rules that I've laid out you
can use the state pattern when we get to
design patterns you'll see that there
might be situations where you want to
have some flexibility that's not
provided by using strict subclassing for
example imagine that you're implementing
a application having to do with a
library and the library might have
different categories of books it might
have one week books two weeks books
four-week books and it might be natural
to say well I'll have three subclasses
of the of the class book but what
happens when a one-week book becomes a
two-week book in object-oriented
languages you can't change the class of
something once you've established it as
as being of a class it's there forever
so the state patterns that allows you to
have a way to have dynamically be able
to adjust the class of an object and
then for languages like C++ that have
multiple inheritance this gives you the
ability to specify the properties that
you wish to inherit in more than one
class and be able to hit inherit from
those classes just what you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
