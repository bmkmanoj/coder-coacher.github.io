is infeasible code the second case the
second case is code that we believe to
be feasible but which isn't worth
covering and code might not be worth
covering if it's very hard to trigger
and it's very simple so let me give a
quick example the res variable gets the
result of a command to format a disk and
if that operation fails we're just going
to abort the program that's what might
be the case is that we lack of
appropriate fault injection tool it will
let us easily simulate the failure of a
format disk call and then furthermore
the response of the code in this case is
to simply abort the execution of the
program if those two things are the case
then we might be perfectly happy not to
test this code branch and the reason is
the abort code which is going to
terminate the entire application is
presumably something that we've tested
elsewhere so we don't have any real
suspicion that it might fail and there's
no reason to think about calling it from
a location like this would act any
differently we're probably okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
