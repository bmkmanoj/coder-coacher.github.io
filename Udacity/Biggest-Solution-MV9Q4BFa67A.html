hope you were able to solve it there are
lots of different ways to solve this
I'll start by working out one way on the
sketchpad and then we'll see a few
different ways to solve it in the Python
interpreter so I'm going to call the
three inputs a B and C we can call them
anything we want and since they're not
meaningful numbers might as well just
use the first three letters so one way
to solve it is to have a big complicated
nested if statement so we're going to
have several comparisons first we want
to check if a is greater than B if a is
greater than B well a might be the
biggest but we don't know yet we still
have to check if a is greater than C so
we need two ifs and the important thing
to notice about the two is the
comparison a greater than C is indented
inside the if a is greater than B so
this will only happen when a is greater
than B that means if a is greater than B
and a is greater than C a is the biggest
so we can return a if it's not well now
we've got the case where a was greater
than B a a is not greater than C so that
means C is greater than or equal to a so
now we know that C is the biggest since
C is bigger or as big as a and a is
bigger than B so now we can return to C
so when this is not true we know that C
is greater than or equal to a and we
know that a is greater than B because
this test evaluated true so we know it's
correct to return C now we want an else
that corresponds to this condition so
here if a is greater than B we evaluated
this code if a is not greater than B
well that means we have B is greater
than or equal to a and in this case we
want to check whether B is greater than
C so we need another if we're going to
is if B is greater than C now we know
that B is greater than C B was greater
than or equal to a because we went to
the else here so that means we can
return B if not well then we know B is
greater than equal to a and C is greater
than equal to B which is greater than or
equal to a so that means C is the
biggest we should return to C so here we
have a definition of the big
it's pretty complicated we have three
different if statements the main one
that starts by comparing a and B and
then within that we compare a and C then
we have the else and within the else we
compare B and C whatever we have lots of
nested if expressions and certainly we
can have more than this amount but this
is already getting to be enough to be
confusing we should try to think if
there's a clearer way to do this a way
to make the code smaller and simpler
easier understand and if is easier to
understand that means it's also easier
to write it correctly so the easier way
to write this would be to use the bigger
procedure that we defined earlier in
this unit and if we remember what that
was we defined bigger like this bigger
took two inputs it compares them if a is
greater than B it returns a if not well
then B is bigger or at least equally big
so we can return B so if we have bigger
defined which we already did then we can
define biggest and much simpler way we
don't need all these ifs all we need to
do is use bigger twice so if we remember
that we have the biggest procedure well
then we can think about biggest this way
so we've got three inputs coming in two
biggest and it should produce one output
the biggest of those three well we've
got the bigger procedure so we could use
bigger to compare to if we put a and B
into bigger the output here is going to
be the bigger of a and B to no the
biggest of the three well now we need to
compare that one with C so the inputs to
this bigger procedure will be the result
of bigger of a and B and the input C and
the output of that will be the biggest
of the three so this is composing two
calls to bigger we want the inputs to
the first call to B a and B we want the
output of that call to be one of the
inputs to the next call so here's how we
can do that in code we can return the
result directly and the result will be
the result of bigger and this is the
last bigger when we do composition we
need to think about the function that we
actually do last coming first because
that one
needs the inputs of the other ones so
the input to this call to bigger it has
two inputs it has the result of this one
which took a and B as its inputs so
that's what's here taking an A and B
producing this output that's one of the
inputs and then the second input to
bigger is C so that's a much shorter way
to write biggest takes advantage of the
fact that we already define a procedure
that does this for two inputs and now we
want to do the biggest for three inputs
there's actually an even easier way to
do it and that's using a built-in
operator there's a built-in operator max
and we could use max directly to
implement bigger just returning the max
of a B and C if we actually knew about
the built-in operator max well then we
wouldn't need to find biggis at all we
could just use the built-in max but the
important thing to see here is that we
can define procedures ourselves and in
fact we've seen enough at this point
that every built-in procedure in Python
you could actually define yourself and
it's even better than that that you
actually know enough at this point that
you could write every possible computer
program using just the things that we've
seen and this is a pretty astounding
result and I mean this in a very strong
sense that everything that could be
computed mechanically by any machine can
be described using a program that only
used the things that we've seen so far
all you need is procedures simple
arithmetic with the comparisons and if
statements and this is a pretty amazing
thing this was shown by Alan Turing back
in the 1930s Alan Turing is probably the
most important computer scientists in
the 1930s he developed an abstract model
of a computer which we now know as a
Turing machine and he proved that that
machine with a very few simple
operations could simulate any other
machine I should point out that Alan
Turing was doing this back in the 1930s
when there weren't computers like we
think of today in the 1930s what someone
thought a computer was was a human who
did calculations and they did
calculations in the mechanical way
following steps such as what you might
have learned in grade school to do long
division or long arithmetic Alan Turing
showed that a very simple model was
enough to capture everything that a
mechanical computer could do whether it
was a human computer or a modern
computer that operates electronically
like we think of today
following World War two he worked at
Bletchley Park this was the headquarters
were all the British efforts to break
the Nazi encryptions were done Alan
Turing led the effort there to break the
Enigma code animo was the most widely
used cypher code by the Nazis and Alan
Turing built machines that could be used
to break the Enigma code these were sort
of like computers they would do lots and
lots of calculations the big difference
between these machines and what we think
of as computers is these machines
weren't programmable they were built for
one very specific task for doing a
calculation that was useful for breaking
enigma encrypted messages and it was
tremendously useful that they could do
that this had a huge impact on World War
two but they weren't computers because
they couldn't be programmed to do
anything else we're not going to get
into the theory of Turing machines in
this course but I hope you'll take one
of the later horses that will do the
important point to make now is that with
a very few simple operations you can
simulate any other operation you want
and you've seen arithmetic you've seen
comparisons you've seen how to define
and call procedures and you've seen how
to use if to make decisions this is
enough to simulate anything else a
computer can do so with just that you
could write every possible computer
program we could end the course here and
you could from just the things that you
know now build any computation you want
we're not gonna end the course here
though and the reason for that is
although you could in theory build every
computation using just these very simple
things that we have so far that's not
going to be the best way to build
computations that there are more
powerful constructs that we can use that
mean with a smaller amount of code or in
a more elegant way that we can write the
computations we want we also have a lot
to learn to get practice using these to
define more interesting programs but in
theory everything that you need to know
to write any possible computation you
already know from just these constructs
that we've seen so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
