have to make the intermediate step of
realizing hey I know what the tangent of
alpha is the reason I know this is
because I know the opposite side is it's
for I know what the adjacent side is 7 I
know tangent relates those two so i can
say tangent of this angle alpha and I
don't even know what what that is yet
but I know it's equal to 4 / 7 I know
that it's possible to go back and forth
between angles and these ratios so I can
type into Google arctan for over seven
in degrees because I don't want my
answer in radians and the answer is 29
point 74 degrees now this was a lot we
just went over it's one thing to be
doing this with tables but now we've
introduced this new notation this new
word arctangent arc sine arc cosine if
you're feeling comfortable with all this
you should move on but if you're still a
little shaky on signs and art tangents
go back and re-watch whatever is helpful
to you if you still have any questions
after that be sure to visit the forums
and there'll be plenty of people myself
included or there to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
