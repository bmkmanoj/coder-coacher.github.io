role of stress in relation to our health
one is the physiological reactivity
model which attempts to explain the
causal role of stress-related bodily
changes in illness the second model is
called the health behavior approach hear
the explanation for illness or health is
focused on the role of behaviors such as
diet exercise and substance abuse we
already discussed how diet exercise and
substance abuse are ways of coping with
stress so we won't say much more about
the health behavior approach however
let's talk about the physiological
reactivity model so let's take this
example let's say you walk into class
and the professor says put your books
away take out a piece of paper we're
having a test hearing this statement
from your professor may cause stress the
fact that you're not prepared for the
pop quiz results in a stressful response
however if you have read the material
and studied hearing the professor's say
put your notes away and get out a sheet
of paper may not result in this
stressful response so here we have an
event which is the pop quiz and then
your appraisal of the situation and this
is what's really important here you may
appraise a situation in a positive and
beneficial way which produces positive
emotions however on the other hand you
may see the situation as negative or
even potentially threatening and that
produces negative emotions from here the
negative emotion causes the stress
response which you can recall is the
activation of the sympathetic nervous
system however prolonged exposure to the
stressful situation causes extended
release of cortisol and sustained
activation of the sympathetic nervous
system which in turn weakens the body as
we discussed earlier the body is
negatively affected by the suppression
of the immune system which increases our
susceptibility to illness now one factor
we did not discuss was that prolonged
exposure to activation of the
sympathetic nervous system also has
negative consequences on our
cardiovascular health</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
