systems connect in two different cities
San Francisco and New York let's further
suppose that a s1 wants traffic to
destination d2 enter via New York City
rather than via the peering link in San
Francisco we'll remember that all things
being equal routers inside a s2 will
select the BGP route with the shortest
IGP path cost to the next stop
resulting in hot potato routing so some
routers would select the san francisco
egress and other routers might select
the new york egress to override this
default hot potato routing behavior AAS
one might advertise its BGP routes to a
s2 with med values for example if the
med value on the route learned at the
border router in new york was 10 and the
med value for the route learned from the
router in san francisco was 20 then
instead of performing hot potato routing
all of these routers that would
ordinarily be closer to the san
francisco egress would instead pick the
route learned via the new york aggress
because the preference for a lower med
value comes before the preference for a
next hop with the lower IGP path cost so
all of these routes would instead be
carried over a s2 s backbone network and
exit via new york the SMED overrides hot
potato routing behavior allowing na s to
explicitly specify that it wants another
neighboring ass to carry the traffic on
its own backbone network rather than
dumping the traffic at the closest
egress and forcing traffic across the
neighbors backbone mids are typically
not used in conventional business
relationships but they're sometimes used
for example if a s1 does not want a s2
free-riding on a s1 s backbone network
so effectively med allows a s1 to say
yes I will connect to appear with you
but it is your job to carry the traffic
long distances across the country this
mechanism is sometimes used when a
transit provider peers with the content
provider and the transit provider
doesn't want the content provider
essentially getting
free transit through the neighboring a s
in the absence of med overriding any
behavior typically what will happen is a
router inside the a s2 would learn
multiple routes via internal BGP to
different egress points for the same
destination D and it would simply pick
the next hop or the egress router with
the lowest IGP path cost in this case
five
it's very common practice to set these
IGP costs in accordance with distance or
propagation delay thus resulting in
routers inside the a s picking shorter
paths now one problem with this notion
of hot potato routing is that a very
small change in I GP path costs can
result in a lot of bgp routing changes
remember that it's probably not just one
destination that's being routed through
the san francisco egress but may be tens
of thousands of routes so a single IGP
path cost change can result in rerouting
of tens of thousands of IP prefixes in
bgp people have looked at various ways
to improve the stability of bgp routing
by decoupling the IGP and the BGP
in this part of the route selection
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
