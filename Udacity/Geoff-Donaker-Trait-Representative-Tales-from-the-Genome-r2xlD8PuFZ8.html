Bay Area California Bay Area and i have
read Miriam color blindness okay so
red-green color blindness we you know
just sort of heard about that for the
first time and the course and we're
learning a bit more about the
inheritance patterns what is red wing
colorblindness what does it mean to be
red green colorblind well to me what it
means is that I often mix up colors that
have read in them and so in particular I
mix up reds and browns and sometimes
browns and greens because I'm not seeing
the red correctly in those sometimes it
can even show up in the form of blues
and purples I'm sort of seeing them all
is about the same and in fact you know
they may look different to other people
so would it be accurate and saying it's
just the kind of like darker colors or
is it something about the shade maybe
I'm not really sure I think that the way
to think about it you know for me is
that sometimes what you may be seeing as
the red in a particular orange for
instance to me I'm not seeing the red
the same way you are so I'm seeing it
may be like a dark yellow and so I
certainly see the world in a vibrant
colorful way and it's not like black and
white or anything like that I just see
it differently than everybody else who
doesn't see it in red green it's such a
great like literal and metaphorical
statement I think a lot of people do go
through life thinking you know the
Assumption this is the color vision this
is the vision I have but not everybody
literally sees the world in the same
spectrum that's right what um when did
you first know that you have red green
color blindness you know I don't really
remember it was when I was a really
young child my uncle had been red-green
colorblind and then actually my mom's
uncle as well so I think it I in Herot
immerse I'd and so when I was a little
kid she recognized that I might be
colorblind or add this propensity and so
she had me tested of you know one of the
eye doctors with looking at the little
bubble charts with colors that you may
remember having taken at some point sure
and for anybody who may not be familiar
with those what can can you describe
that bubble chart a little more sure
it's a basically a lot of little dots
and those dots typically show some sort
of a picture or character or letter that
a red-green colorblind
person may not be able to pick out the
particular picture or letter that
everybody else you know look it pops out
so for instance back to my yellow orange
analogy you know you may have two
different shades of orange in there that
do you look really obviously different
and to me look actually about the same
so I'm not seeing that letter that's
popping out of the picture and you are
there are actually other versions that
go the other way where you know it looks
really stark to the red-green colorblind
person and to the NOC red-green
colorblind person it actually looks you
know camouflaged and so those tests you
know make it pretty easy for the eye
doctors to pick out who's colorblind a
song so you were very young when when
you're I guess your mother found this
out that's right and did it um I mean
was it up did it cause any issue of me
it was like okay we knew this was a
possibility and now what kind of if
anything was there to do at that point
not really much um you know as I say her
brother and uncle had had it and so she
was sort of aware of it and you know
it's it's useful to know that you see
the world in different colors than
everybody else just so you can be
prepared and you know obviously that's
something I just did my way around today
too so that I I don't say you know this
is definitely purple to people if I
realize ago it might actually be blue
you know others are sitting in this blue
nice it does bring that interesting
perspective the fact that you put in
that context of you know you don't want
to speak with certainty that this is
this color because you're like it may
not be right but what is quote/unquote
right is just what the majority of other
people see I mean could argue that if
more people had saw the spectrum as a
red-green colorblind person the way we
describe that you know then that would
be purple I guess agree so as you've
grown up and even now as an adult um how
does red green color blindness affect
your daily life do you have what kind of
special if anything sort of interactions
you have to go through to accommodate
you know not much when I clothes shop
you know online certainly helps these
days because the colors are all labeled
you know when I go to clothes shopping
in a store I'll often ask the retail
person just to
what color is this if it's blue I'm
generally pretty sure I'm okay or black
or things like that but if I'm getting
something that's in the green spectrum
you know I want to sand is a check that
it's what I think it is and it's not
some burden of orange or something that
people are going to comment on so that's
one way you know another way is just
periodically things that look
camouflaged to me won't be camouflaged
to other people so for instance you know
my kids the other day we're playing with
an orange ball in the yard and to me
when it dropped in the grass it was
almost camouflaged in the grass and you
know they thought that was the funniest
thing in the world because today I'm is
orange is totally popping off the law
right right so you would actually have
to sort of keep track of where it is to
a little bit you know again if it's
right by me of course I did see it by
sure I want to back up a little bit and
talk about generalities I mean just as
you as Jeff Donecker what are the what
are your kind of hobbies what kind of
things do you do for fun in general well
I've got young kids are pretty into
sports at this point and you know
certainly helping them with school and
their sports they like to play baseball
and soccer and just generally run around
like little boys do so other than work
of what I tend to do with my start time
is you know kind of hang out with my
family and run around playing sports
with them yeah I've heard that I kids
can be a full-time job but full-time
play job too indeed it's a little about
that later love were you did you have to
get your your you said you have two sons
did you were you worried about having
them having red-green color blindness to
at all we didn't really think about it I
had always assumed based on our family
history that had come through my mom's
side of the family and as a result given
my wife doesn't have any history of
colorblindness on her side of the family
we sort of assumed that our kids weren't
would not be color blind and then they
haven't been
I indicated any color blindness and so
sure College follow-up sure you know
we've talked about a lot of other traits
in our course like lactose intolerance
some some traits that just sort of you
know every day but people may interact
with differently some people assume you
know everyone may be lactose tolerant or
that everyone can see you know all
colors the way they do in certain ways
how have do people in general friends
strangers respond to anybody news of
someone being hey guys can you wait a
second I'm not sure about this how do
people respond to this particular trade
of red green color blindness um I don't
say that you know probably about half of
people that I interact with already know
somebody closely who is red green
colorblind so it's no news to them and
they'll just say oh yeah my brother is
also or something to that nature and
then the other half it's like a great
party trick so the first time they ear
that you're ready colorblind what they
want to do is walk around the room going
what colors that's what colors expert
you know which is fun for about 30
seconds that's been my general
experience over the years yeah I can
imagine that's good for like the first
two times right right motion that one
thing that it occurred to me in terms of
day-to-day life is sometimes LCD
projectors and things of that nature the
Reds and those don't show up very well
and so that's kind of other way
you know kind of modern life or Sirhan's
things that are real obvious to the
other people are kinda like well I don't
see that at all because of the
particular Hughes ever chosen so it's
interesting you say that I am from a
research science background and there's
a particular kind of experiment for lack
of a better word called a microarray
that you can do and when you get the
results back they color code all the
results and it's a spectrum from red to
green and yellow it goes from like red
to yellow to black to yellow to green
and it's supposed to give you it's
essentially heat mapping of some of
sorts and there was eventually finally
you know people spoke up who are regular
color bryce's guys can we please change
this to like blue yellow so that we can
look at the data too yeah that's right
if you ever doing this kind of charts if
you can make the red blue or the green
blue or something like that let's just
pick one of them so it doesn't go from
green to yellow to red exactly have you
ever not been able to participate in
something or anything because of the
color blindness or anything like that or
be pretty much always been able to find
some work around if it was an issue you
could you know it was always doable yeah
I mean as a general statement it's
really never been a big deal I certainly
remember a couple times as a kid where I
felt a little left out or picked on
during art projects at school or you
know inevitably I'd picked the wrong
color you were supposed to do something
that was brown and I picked green or
something of that nature than other kids
would tease me and yeah I really
remember maybe two or three of these
incidents but he certainly work around
it and somebody points you to the right
color and we keep moving so never been a
big deal by any means but you know
there's certainly a little bit of that
looking you are a little bit different
from the way everybody else I see it
sure in that same vein I mean it seems
like a follow-up question that have
asked lots of different people about
their various traits would you want to
change this about yourself or would you
not um you know that's an interesting
question I think now my life no I don't
bother I guess if I had it all to do
over in the spirit of what your you guys
are talking about sure yeah I'd probably
rather you know see the world in the
same color hues and that
else does just you know common one more
thing makes it things a little bit
easier mm-hmm are there any advantages
to seeing colors differently um you know
the main one at this point is really the
party trick making it making friends
quickly right right but ostensibly in an
earlier time because there are some
forms of camouflage that look like
camouflage to you know the normal folk
but don't to me ostensibly during world
war two and kind of previous era
red-green colorblind people could be
pilots because they could actually spot
the camouflage from you know the army
troops easily then you know a typical
person's eyes I could so that was a good
sino legend that I've heard the years
never been relevant in my life you know
I guess another funny way in which it
shows up for me as things like it's very
easy for me to take the Christmas tree
lights on and off the tree every year
because the wires actually really pop
out for me and to everybody else
ostensibly they're like totally blend in
with the tree oh yeah it's totally try
normally have trouble I'm like searching
the branch trying to like just yank and
pull happy to come over here yeah I
appreciate the offer might take you up
on that so we'll finish up here I want
to ask you one more question if but if
someone's watching this and you know
they're like oh you know I wonder if I'm
color blind or maybe someones recently
found out they are someone they know is
what advice would you give to somebody
who may have recently found out that you
know they are red-green colorblind and
of course there are other kinds of
colorblindness too what advice would you
give to them um yeah I guess first point
would simply be it's not that big a deal
so you know roll with it and enjoy the
fact that you're seeing the world and a
slightly different color hues and
everybody else is and then the other one
would be yeah when you're picking
clothes ask a friend or their
the sales associate at the store just so
that you know what you're buying sure um
well thanks Jeff for joining us thanks
Matt and good luck everybody other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
