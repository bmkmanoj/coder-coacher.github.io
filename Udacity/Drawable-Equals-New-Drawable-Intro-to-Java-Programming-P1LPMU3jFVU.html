interface type we know this can't be the
answer because we have assigned objects
of certain classes two variables of
interface types in the example before
this you saw code that created new dogs
and then put them in drawable variables
or added them to lists of drawable items
so the statement is false this statement
is true but doesn't apply in this case I
can only put an object into a variable
with an interface type if the object is
of a class that implements the interface
like in this case but if the dog class
didn't implement the drawable interface
I wouldn't be able to do this if you're
not quite sure why you can't construct
an interface type let's look at the code
this is the code for a dog it has all of
the information on how to move and how
to draw the drawable interface has
almost no information at all if you
tried to make a new drawable it would
know that it should know how to draw but
wouldn't know how to draw that's why
Java won't let you construct a drawable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
