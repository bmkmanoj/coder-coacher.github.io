and all of the database products are a
little different so most of what I'm
going to cover in this lesson applies in
the general case but not always but one
of the things that does apply in almost
every general case is this notion of
tables so let's say we're building a
site like Reddit that's going to take
links from users and we will store them
in a database and allow users to vote on
those links and then we'll show what's
the most popular so we'll probably have
a table for links and this link is made
up of a number of things it's got an ID
it's probably got a number of votes it's
got the the user that's submitted the
link it's got a date of when the link
was submitted and it probably has a
title this is what we display on the
site and a URL so these are all called
columns of the database the columns are
basically the properties that make up a
particular type so in this case our type
is a link that's what we're going to
call our table and these are columns now
every entry of a link in this table is
called a row so we may have a link that
looks something like this here would be
an example ID five it's just an integer
the number of votes that this link has
the user that submitted it this is an
interesting column we'll come back to
this the date of when the link was
submitted and a title in the URL so
let's talk about each of these columns
now this thing in its entirety is called
a row and a rows one instance of you
know an element in this table so you
know will have many many rows for all
the links that are submitted and and my
label isn't very good here but these are
the columns columns go down rows go
cross let's talk about each of these
columns so the ID column is important in
almost all tables generally every row
will have an ID and this is how you
refer to that row specifically so this
is link number five it's not required in
most databases that you have something
called an ID but it's really helpful and
in some databases it is in fact required
usually it's an integer it could be a
string the database on Google App Engine
allows you to use integers or strings
so this column here votes this this
column is also an integer you know this
just refers to the number of votes on
this link this column here user is also
an integer so this is a reference to the
ID of the user who submitted the link so
we may have another table called you
know users or user that may have its own
set of columns one of which is an ID you
may also have like name and and date and
maybe like password so there could be a
another table called user that stores
all of our users and you know this
column is just a reference to this other
table and we'll come back more to these
types of relationships later but you
know just know that this is a common way
of doing things okay so then we'll have
it we'll have our date column for the
link and this probably has a type of of
date not all databases support the date
type but the ones we'll be using in this
class do and it's really handy to you
know store the stuff and this is
ultimately probably you know an integer
but uh you know depending on the
sophistication of the database they may
have a real date type and of course
we'll have the title which is a string
you know this may also in some databases
be known as text or far char or you know
there's lots of ways of referring to it
but it's basically just you know
referring to this type but it's you know
just a string and URL is the same thing
it's also string our table is made up of
you know defined of columns and it's
filled up with rows you know every time
a user submits something we add a new
row so if another submission comes in
may have zero votes and submitted by
user 27 this table can have a lot of a
lot of data in it before we go into
specific database stuff let's let's work
through some examples in Python of you
know how we might manipulate this kind
of structured data programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
