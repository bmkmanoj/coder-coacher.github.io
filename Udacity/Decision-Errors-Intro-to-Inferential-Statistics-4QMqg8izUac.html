prone to misinterpretations as we
discussed in the last solution video
it's possible that those who are able to
view the musical lesson happen to be
more engaged students already and we
wrongly attributed this high mean
engagement score to the song of course
it's unlikely we found that the
probability of getting that sample mean
engagement score was about point zero
zero seven but it's still possible to
have randomly obtained a sample with
that mean but this means that one of
four things can happen here's a diagram
that's not completely filled out but it
shows the fourth possible things that
can happen the columns represent the
decision we made we either rejected the
null or retain the null based on what
the results of our sample the state of
the world is what is actually happening
and we don't know what it is we're just
making a guess either the null is true
that there's not any significant effect
from the treatment or the null is false
there is a significant effect each of
these four boxes represents a different
situation the truth and then the
decision we made in two of these four
cases we made the correct statistical
decision but in the other two we made
the wrong decision check the two cases
in which we've made the wrong
statistical decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
