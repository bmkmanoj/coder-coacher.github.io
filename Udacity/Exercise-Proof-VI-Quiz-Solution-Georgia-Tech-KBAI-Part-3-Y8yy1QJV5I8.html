pick David so I picked the first one but
I think it's actually two correct
answers what we're looking for is
something else in s one that has a
negation in another sentence not has
wings has a negation in s2 so we could
resolve on s2 with the not has wings
portion of s1 has fur also has a
negation in s3 so we could also resolve
on s3 and he has fur portion of s1 this
is right David at the end of this wheel
deferred null which is a contradiction
therefore our assumption that it's not
bird is false therefore it must be a
bird and the robot has just proved that
this must be a bird not what we have
done we have mechanized parts of logic
instead of coming up with large truth
tables and instead of coming up with
complex chains of inference based on
modus ponens and modus tollens we have
found an algorithm called resolutions
you're improving which is an efficient
way of proving sentences and the truth
values this is how it works take all the
sentence in the knowledge base convert
them into conduct a normal form take
what you want to prove and its negation
but that is a new sentence now starting
with this particular sentence a new
sentence find a literal in another
sentence on which you can resolve and
keep on doing it until you find a null
condition which is a contradiction if we
don't find an old condition if you don't
find a contradiction that means that
what you started with cannot be proved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
