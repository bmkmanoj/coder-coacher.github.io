over 8 1 8th probability of having an
affected child so let's see why this is
let's take it one step at a time let's
go to our affected individuals which we
know must be homozygous recessive based
on the autosomal recessive pattern if
you're affected it means you must be
homozygous now let's look at the
father's father he must pass down one
recessive allele one of the minuses but
the father here is not affected so we
know that the other allele must be the
dominant this means that the father has
a probability of one of being
heterozygous we know the father is
heterozygous now let's come over here to
the grandmother again she must have
passed down one recessive copy and we
see that her daughter is unaffected so
she must have one normal dominant copy
so this means she's definitely
heterozygous a probability of 1 and
what's the probability that she'll pass
down the recessive allele not the
dominant allele to her daughter we know
the only possibility is to be
heterozygous because she's unaffected
but what's the probability of passing
that recessive allele on its one-half
right there's only one half chance for
that to happen we assume because this is
a rare disease trait that anyone mating
in from the outside is unaffected so we
assume plus plus here type three von
Willebrand's disease along with many
other genetic disorders are pretty rare
and so unless we have some reason to
think otherwise whenever you see
individuals mating in from the outside
we assume that they're homozygous normal
so the probability of this offspring of
this child being heterozygous is
one-half so now we have the couple the
man and the woman the male and the
female and if they're both heterozygous
then what's the probability that i'll
have an affected offspring well we can
set up the punnett square if that makes
it easier for us and we see that out of
four possible options one out of four is
homozygous dominant one out of four is
homozygous recessive and two out of four
are heterozygous so there's a one in
four chance of being affected or
homozygous recessive so now all we do is
multiply the probabilities that each of
the intermediate
individuals or heterozygous along with
the probability that the offspring will
be affected so one times one here times
one half times one fourth is equal to 1
over 8 which is the solution if you had
trouble with this that is all right
genetic counselors have to be pretty
good at estimating probability and it
takes some time and you may even want to
use a calculator but hopefully you have
a new appreciation for someone who can
read a pedigree efficiently and answer a
question like the probability of having
an affected individual in a family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
