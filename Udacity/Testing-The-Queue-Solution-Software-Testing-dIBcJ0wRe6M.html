at my answer real quick so this is the
original test function that you had test
one and remember that we said that some
of the behaviors that that doesn't test
for is basically all of these if
statements here so I'm going to go ahead
and just write test two to test these
two main ones that is that the size if a
size is equal to the max then we return
false
and if the tail is equal to the max then
we reset the tail to zero so let's go
ahead and build that okay so in test two
we create a queue of size two and we
make sure that it's empty to begin with
just as a good start and we in q1 and in
q2 we make sure that these both return
true and then we in q3 or we attempted
hit two in q3 which shouldn't work
because remember it's only an acute of
size two it can only store two elements
so we should be able to check that the
tail Q dot tail does not equal zero if
it doesn't then we haven't reset it to
zero like we said we did right up here
remember so that would be a problem and
we check that right there and otherwise
we print out test two is okay so if we
go ahead and run this okay and we see
that we print out test two is okay so
everything is good so now let's go ahead
and check out test three so for the
third test remember let's take a look at
the DQ function really quick so we want
to test that when you DQ an empty queue
you should return none since there's
nothing to return then we also want to
check that if we DQ and we have gone
past the end of the queue that is the
head pointer has stepped out into a
larger element than the total length of
the queue or the size of the queue then
we want to reset it to zero so if we go
forward and we're past the end and we
want to wrap it back around so let's go
ahead take a look at test three okay so
the first thing we do is we initialize Q
of one element so can only store one
element it's not a terribly exciting
queue so first we try to empty it which
shouldn't
work does and we've got a problem then
after that we try to DQ and so remember
this should return none if it doesn't
return none then again we've got a
problem
if it does then we continue now we in
queue one element so at this point the
queue is full and head should be at one
which is the max size of the queue so
now when we try to DQ we should reset Q
dot head to zero
if we don't then we've got a problem and
we go ahead and check that the element
that we get back out from DQ is also one
just to be complete so if we get through
all this then we print out test3 okay so
let's go ahead and run that and we see
that yes test3 is okay so you might have
tested different things you also might
have tested just some of these and
that's fine the goal was just to try to
figure out different places in the code
that you could test against that we
hadn't already given you and that's a
really important thing to learn how to
do as a tester so okay let's go ahead
and move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
