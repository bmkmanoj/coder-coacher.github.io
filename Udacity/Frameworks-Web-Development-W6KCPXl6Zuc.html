a lot is how you choose between web
frameworks now remember the framework is
generally the piece Tepes it's between
your program and the Internet now in
this class we've been using Google App
Engine framework which is basically
called web app 2 which I found really
nice this handles basically basic HTTP
kind of the scheduling like the
threading issues you know handing a
multiple requests at once parsing basic
headers basically looking for things out
of the get requests or the post requests
and putting them into these like request
objects turning your response object
into the appropriate HTTP to send to the
browser the URL mapping and all that
stuff is really helpful various degrees
of web framework that give you more or
less control and require you to do more
or less work the level that we've been
working on in web F 2 is the level where
I really like to be the things that I
really like about it are that we have
direct access to get in post some
frameworks kind of hide this from you
and I think it's really important that
you are explicit about which method
you're handling a get or a post if
you're thinking about the web in that
way your websites would generally make
more sense you won't make the mistakes
of having or you won't as easily make
mistakes as having your you know your
get to modify the database and then
getting cached weird and you know your
forms not submitting properly
understanding webs and web applications
at the kind of method level I think is
very very important we've got direct
access to the request you know this
means things like headers yes there are
convenience functions for setting
cookies and getting cookies but you can
also manipulate the headers directly
sometimes you want to do something funky
with content type or content length and
if the web framework doesn't let you do
that it can be really frustrated can't
build a site the way you want to so I
find this kind of low-level stuff is
really helpful but it's not so low that
you're dealing with like HTTP versions
and host headers unless you really want
to they're kind of features that a lot
of frameworks do that I think are not
important
this is strictly in my opinion things
like sessions caching some have
automatic forms database or EMM stuff I
don't like working with these so I find
every time I use something like this
it's very soon after that I need a
custom behavior I want to handle
sessions differently or I want to cache
things differently or my forms don't fit
the way the author thinks forms should
work or you know the ORM can't express
queries that I want to express or won't
let me cache the way I want to cache
certain queries so I find this sort of
stuff is a little too high level for me
and I always end up rewriting it anyway
to me the important things are basic
HTTP having access to headers and get in
post I almost never use pre-built
sessions
things and caching forms and database
stuff and every experience I've had in
the long run I end up getting frustrated
they have to rewrite something that
would have dispensed simply to do in the
first place I generally don't like magic
when you look at some code and it just
seems too magical like it did all this
stuff for you and you're so far away
from the request that you don't actually
know what happened that's a terrible way
to write web software you're not going
to be able to scale it properly you're
not going to know why something breaks
when it inevitably does and it going to
take you I think ultimately will cost
you more work than just thinking through
to these problems on your own sometimes
it's good way to get started something
that didn't discuss here are the notion
of templates template languages come in
all varieties I am partial to one on
Python called Mako what we've been using
in this class is Jinja two and Jinja has
also been great I think that the
discipline here when you're using
templates is making sure you separate
code from templates a lot of these
template systems allow you to put
arbitrary code in them or complicated
logical structures if and for and while
try to keep it to the the amount of code
and templates to a minimum you've got
this whole language you know in our case
Python that's very very powerful
language you can do all sorts of things
why would you use a broken subset of
that in your templates any complexity
should be actually in your Python code
and not a new template code didn't come
up much in this class because most of
the rendering code we're using was
fairly simple it's really easy to just
throw complete objects and big data
structures and unwind them and navigate
them in your template code and that's
something it's just really difficult to
maintain
I wouldn't recommend doing that
templates are great but use them with
care use them for just generating your
HTML or just generating your CSS or
whatever you're using it for and try to
keep the code in the actual programming
