to you by now NP is the complexity class
of all problems that can be solved in
polynomial time on a non-deterministic
Ram that's what the end here stands for
now you might have found this quiz
rather easy but actually that you're so
familiar with P and NP I think it's
something special because I find that
not many people actually understand what
P and NP stands for and what the
difference is between the two now if you
really want to impress a theoretical
computer scientist of course you have to
be a little bit nitpicky first of all P
and NP formally are defined for decision
problems so here we set all problems but
actually if you're very formal it's only
for decision problems and the other
thing is that originally those classes
were not defined on the RAM but rather
on a computer model known as a Turing
machine named after the computer pioneer
Alan Turing now having a precise
definition doesn't really change
anything about P and NP the way that we
were talking about it but when you get
down into the details of these classes
it might actually matter that you have a
Turing machine here instead of the RAM
and that you're talking about decision
problems instead of optimization
problems but for here I think it's fine
to just think of it as the complexity
class of all problems that can be solved
in polynomial time on a deterministic or
a non-deterministic Ram</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
