frosted vanilla icing and two-fifths of
it is frosted in strawberry icing so I
have 14 and two-fifths I need to add
these two fractions together to figure
out how much of the cake is frosted in
total my fractions do not have common
denominators I have force and I have
fifths so I need to get the same size
pieces to find the common denominator
I'm going to do the least common
multiple method so I'm going to list the
multiples of 4 and the multiples of five
the smallest number that both 4 &amp;amp; 5 go
into is 20 I could also find that by
using my factor tree method when I think
about the factors at four and five have
in common the only factor that they
share is one I know the other factor of
four must be four since four times one
is for the other factor of five must be
five multiplying these together I still
get 20 so I know I need to change force
in the twentieths and fifths and a
twentieths to change force into
twentieths i need to multiply by 5 over
5 i know this because 20 is the fifth
multiple of 4 i also know this because i
have to multiply 4 times 5 to end up
with 20 so 5 times 1 is 5 and 5 times 4
is 20 to change two-fifths in the 20th i
need to multiply by 4 over 4 remember
i'm still multiplying by 1 2 times 4 is
8 and 5 times 4 is 20 now this is great
I can actually add the 20th together I
have five twentieth and eight 20th i
keep my denominator the same and eight
plus 5 is 13 so i get 13 20th if you
chose 13 20th nice work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
