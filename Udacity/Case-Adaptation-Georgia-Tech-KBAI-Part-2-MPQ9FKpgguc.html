more deeply so once again here is the
process of case based reasoning I have
kind of blurred the retrieval step we're
going to assume here the retrieval of
the case has already occurred perhaps
using the KNN method that we discussed
last time last time we also said two
other things one that a fundamental
common ROM that air agents face is that
the problems they encounter are usually
very complex from a computational
perspective and they have only limited
cognitive resources so then how can they
address computationally complex problems
with limited cognitive resources in near
real-time seemingly effortlessly and we
said part of the answer might be that
memory supplies with an answer where we
go to make a small amendment to it
memory surprised with it answer an
almost correct answer so that the
adaptation that we have to do is very
small very minor
it's a tweak as an example of adaptation
being mostly tweaking consider this
simple problem the everyday problem of
cooking meals so you may have a recipe
for your favorite kind of meal and
imagine that this time you're going to
have your favorite meal perhaps with
different company or perhaps with a
different kind of salad or appetizer
well in that case you might tweak your
recipe for that particular dish you're
not going to change it in a radical way
you're simply making a small change to
it so I'll show another example of this
that comes to mind very readily for me
goes back to your programming example
from earlier in this lesson so one thing
that almost every program I write has to
do is input data from a file but right
now I couldn't write that process from
scratch well I always do is I look at
however I did at the previous time and
I'll modify it for the new folder or the
new kind of data or the new kind of file
I'm reading from but really I'm just
taking the same process and tweaking it
for my new problem that's a good point
David in fact in the design commonly
there is an old cliche which says that
all design is redesigned design is
fundamentally evolutionary we take all
designs and we evolve them slightly and
that's how we get a new design and the
same thing is happening in case based
reasoning here it is saying that often
this particular solutions that we come
up with
in the nature in the sense that there
are small tweaks over previous solutions
so the next question becomes how can we
adapt in all case to meet the
requirements of a new problem there are
potentially several ways of doing it we
will discuss three important ways
perhaps the three most common ways of
adapting a case they are called the
model-based method the recursive case
based method and the rule-based method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
