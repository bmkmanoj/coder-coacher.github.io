proximity can influence attraction that
is how close someone is to us it turns
out that when selecting a potential mate
we see that where someone lives can play
a significant role in who we select
simply due to their proximity meaning
that if you grow up in the Midwest of
the United States this likely rules out
the possibility of falling in love with
someone who lives in Paris that is
unless you travel to Paris on vacation
and meet the love of your life there are
four proximity to other individuals
provides us the opportunity for
attraction it may not come as a surprise
to you but physical features can play a
large role in attraction for example men
who are attracted to women tend to
prefer the hourglass figure and some
people believe that this figure is
associated with fertility on the other
hand women who are attracted to men tend
to prefer the tapering V body figure
some field studies have found that
woman's weight and men's height are the
best predictor so how many responses
they'll get to a personal ad another
study that looked at online dating
choices of men and women found that
physical attractiveness was the only
predictor of dating choice and as it
turns out appearance doesn't only play a
role in who were attracted to it plays a
role in many different contexts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
