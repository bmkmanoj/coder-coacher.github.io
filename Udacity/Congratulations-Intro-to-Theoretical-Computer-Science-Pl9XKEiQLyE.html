of our introduction to theoretical
computer science we have introduced a
lot of essential concepts and tools and
you have managed to master them and now
have them at your disposal so you know
what a ram is you know about oh no
tation or big o-notation
you know how to analyze algorithms and
you've also learned to understand three
very very important problems in computer
science known as clique independent set
and vertex cover and while discussing
these problems you will also learn about
the important concepts of polynomial
time algorithms exponential time
algorithms and the connected concepts of
tractable problems and intractable
problems having all of these concepts
and tools at your disposal
you're ready to dive deeper into
figuring out if we can make Alice Bob
and Carol happy by finding out that
their problems are tractable or if we
have to bring them bad news and show
that their problems are intractable but
for now again congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
