blind spot raise your hand you can't
it's blind no we're going to do that so
it's actually really really easy a
couple of ways that we can do this so on
my screen right now I have a picture of
a plus and a dot your blind spot is
always on the outside of your visual
field so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to look for the blind spot in my
left eye so it's going to be outside so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
flow it happened right now so right now
I'm looking at that dot on the right and
to the left of it is across and if I
move here there's the cross there's a
cross but right here the cross is gone I
think that's a 12 Dubai camera but i
think it's 12 degrees out right it's
just not there it's just plain black ok
if I want to do it with my right eye
well what I'll do is I'll look at the
cross and I'll move until I up there
goes the circle is gone if you are doing
this if you rotate your head like that
the cross comes back because the blind
spot is located off to one side and as I
rotate the blind spot is now up here in
the cross pops back in class normally
what I do is I make a bunch of pieces of
paper and I hand this out right here ok
and I ask people to take their left eye
so for those of you who have not paying
attention so we have a dot and over here
we have a bar with a crosshatch pattern
in the middle of it and what I do is I
tell people to move that dot till
something seems to happen to that bar
alright so back here I see the bar with
the cross hash I move in and then
something happens the crosshatch
disappears into just the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
