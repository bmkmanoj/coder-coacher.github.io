hope you feel like you understand at a
high level what's going on in a
web-browser what's going on when you
request the page over the Internet
there's certainly lots of details we're
not going to cover them all in this
class but I think you should have a
pretty clear picture of everything
that's going on there's nothing that's
magic here everything can be understood
everything's done by sending messages
across the internet and getting
responses back and the responses are
just texts that are processed either by
your web browser or now by your very own
web crawler that you've written and now
you've got a search engine that can
respond to queries so congratulations
for making it to the end of unit 4
there'll be a homework to do now and in
unit 5 we're gonna look at the problem
of how to actually make our search
engine scale the search engine that
we've built in unit 4 works it gives us
responses to queries it doesn't do that
in a very fast or smart way that's what
we're gonna improve in unit 5 we're
gonna make it so we can respond to
queries much faster than we can with the
code that we've written so far and then
in unit 6 we're gonna look at the very
interesting question of how do you find
the best response for a given query we
don't usually want to get all the pages
that contain the search word we're
looking for what we want to do is get
the best page and that's what we'll look
at in unit 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
