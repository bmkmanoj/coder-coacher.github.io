unit see there's a specific cancer that
occurs in 1% of the population and the
test for this cancer and with 90% chance
it is positive if we have this cancer
see that's usually called the
sensitivity our test but the test
sometimes is positive even if you don't
have C so let's say with another 90%
chance it is negative if you don't have
C this usually called this best C tivity
so here's my question
without further symptoms you take the
test and the test comes back as positive
what do you think is not the probability
of having that specific type of cancer
to answer this let's draw a diagram
suppose these are all the people and
some of them exactly 1% have cancer 99%
is cancer-free we know there's a test
that if you have cancer correctly this
diagnosis with 90% chance so if you draw
the area where the test is positive
cancer and test positive then this area
over here is 90 percent of the cancer
circle however that isn't the full truth
the test Sanders is positive even if the
person doesn't have cancer in fact in
our case that happen to be in 10% of all
cases so if you have to add more area
there's this biggest 10% of this large
area there is as big as 10% of this
large area where the test might go
positive but the person doesn't have
cancer
so this blue area is 10% of all the area
over here - the little small cancer
circle and clearly all the area outside
these circles correspond the situation
of no cancer and the test is negative so
let me ask you again
suppose you have a positive test what do
you think with a prior probability of
cancer of 1% a sensitivity and
specificity of 90% do you think your new
chances are now 90% or 8% or still just
1%</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
