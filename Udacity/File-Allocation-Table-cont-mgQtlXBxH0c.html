format works let's consider its
strengths and weaknesses it is easy to
create a new file so we just need to
adjust the directory table of the parent
directory and set the busy bit in the
fat for the starting block growing a
file is as easy as adjusting the next
field of the fact space usage is
efficient too if a block is free then it
can be used and it doesn't matter
whether the adjacent blocks are being
used or not this means that the system
won't suffer from what is called
external fragmentation as for access it
will behave much like a linked list it
will be great for sequential access as
we quickly find and follow the links but
poor for random access since we have to
walk through half the links to get to
the middle of a file and all of the
links to get to the end this isn't as
bad as it might seem at first because we
keep the fat in memory but it's still
not ideal overall then that is a poor
choice for situations where random
access to large files as necessary nted
is falling out of favor it is still good
good choice for removable storage
however when one is mostly just copying
data from one machine to another and
hence only using sequential access and
it's space efficiency makes it
especially attractive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
