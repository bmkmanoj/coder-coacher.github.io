proposition now value proposition is not
something you're building in isolation
well the value proposition is about
solving a customer problem or need it
really consists of three components the
easy one for most entrepreneurs to talk
about is what product features you have
or what products services you're
providing but there's actually two more
important components to value
proposition what gain are you creating
for customers and what pain are you
solving for them Alexander Osterwalder
when he drew the business model canvas
really emphasized this it's not just
about your product and especially if you
come from a technical background it's
really easy to see oh look at all these
features and if you find yourself doing
that you need to complete the sentence
and say yes but here's what we make
people be able to do better and here are
the problems we solve for them so the
real goal of you figuring out the value
proposition is understanding what we
call the minimal Viable Product you're
trying to figure out now that I kind of
understand my product and service and
that what I'm gaining for customers on
pain I'm solving what's the smallest
possible feature set I could be shipping
on day one that solves these pains and
creates gains for them and this really
is an interactive process because
there's no way no possible way sitting
in your office you could figure this out
and the default for great engineers and
great entrepreneurs is oh I understand
customers problems a need so you know
don't worry about it we'll just spec the
entire product on day one your real goal
here is to figure out what's the
smallest thing you could build and
develop then actually get you users or
sales or whatever and get out the market
as quickly as possible and so the goal
of you getting out of the building for
value proposition is understanding gains
and pains so you can figure out what's
the MVP or Minimum Viable Product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
