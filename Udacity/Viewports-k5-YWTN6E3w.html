often necessary but there is quite a lot
of fuss involved with getting aspect
ratio right and in positioning your
world on the screen if you don't need to
move your camera around in your game
world it's often easier to use a
viewport to manage your camera we've set
up a little demo project to show off the
various viewports what we're doing is
we're drawing a little checkerboard
that's 16 units wide by 9 units tall
which is intentionally not the same size
as the window we're going to use to
display this world so here and create
we've made a orthographic camera and the
first viewport we're going to explore is
the screen viewport the screen viewport
doesn't care about the size of the world
it just sets the camera up for pixel for
pixel drawing this is great if you need
that in particular but it's not super
useful for most games let's check out
what it does
so our checkerboard is down here in the
bottom left and it's 9 pixels tall and
16 pixels wide and you can hardly see it
at all let's try another viewport that
might be better for this task here we've
switched over to a stretch of viewport
stretch viewport makes the world exactly
fit the screen but it doesn't respect
the aspect ratio of the world so things
might look stretched either horizontally
or vertically since our world is 16
units wide by 9 units tall and the
aspect ratio of this is squarer than
that that means our world gets stretched
vertically or squashed horizontally
depends how you want to think about it
now we've switched over to a fill
viewport fill viewport does respect the
aspect ratio of the world but it might
clip some parts of the world in order to
make that true for instance this world
is now only 12 by 9 instead of 16 by 9
the extra is off-screen to the left and
right a fit viewport make sure that the
entire world is visible and at the
correct aspect ratio however it does
this by adding black bars at the top and
bottom or left and right to Pat out the
rest of the window this is also called
letterboxing it's what happens when you
watch widescreen movies on old TVs this
is a great choice when the exact size of
the game world is essential but it can
look bad on devices that have very
different aspect ratios from what you
intend the last viewport type is the
extend viewport the extend viewport also
ensures that the entire game world is
visible and at the correct aspect ratio
it just makes the game world bigger in
the smaller dimension in order to fill
up the rest of the space so if you
remember from the screen viewport we had
this green apron all around you can see
it in this version because we're
actually allowed to draw up here back
when we were using the fit viewport
those black bars we weren't allowed to
draw anything out there at all when it
comes to making games that work across a
whole range of devices with different
aspect ratios extend viewport is almost
always the best choice when you can get
away with it
remember the screen viewport makes the
size of the world match the size of the
screen pixel for pixel stretch viewport
makes the world fill the screen
regardless of aspect ratio fill viewport
also makes the world fill the screen
maintaining the aspect ratio but cutting
off bits of the world fit viewport fits
the world inside the screen adding black
bars to Pat out the extra space to
maintain the aspect ratio and finally
extend viewport makes the short axis of
the world larger to fill the screen
maintaining the aspect ratio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
