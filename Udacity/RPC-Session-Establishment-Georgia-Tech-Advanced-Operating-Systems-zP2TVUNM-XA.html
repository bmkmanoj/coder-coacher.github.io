client workstation Venus will establish
an RPC session on behalf of the client
and in order to establish the RPC
session the following message exchange
is going to happen and this is what is
called the bind operation between the
client and the server
so what Venus is going to do is send the
client identity and an encrypted cipher
the client identity as I mentioned
earlier in private key cryptosystems you
have to send it in clear text so that
the server knows the identity of the
client and in order to establish a new
RPC session Venus will use the secret
token as the client identity and it will
use the HKC the handshake key for the
client that was contained in the clear
token data structure that was given back
to the workstation by the server as part
of executing the login process that is
the key that will be used for encrypting
the starting message for the RPC session
establishment now what exactly is the
message that is being sent well all that
is sent for initiating this RPC session
establishment is a random number which
is new for each RPC session that Venus
is establishing on behalf of this client
every time it wants to establish a new
RPC session within a login session it
creates a new random number and encrypts
it using the handshake key that's the
cipher text and the secret token is the
client ID and that's the message that
goes from virtue to vice the server so
when this message arrives at the server
how will the server decrypt this message
well the client ID is a secret token
recall that the secret token is nothing
but an encryption of the clear token
with a key that is known only to the
server and therefore what the server can
do is take the secret token decrypted
using the key that it has and once it
decrypts it it gets this clear token
data structure and from the clear token
data structure it can say well what is
the key that is contained in this clear
token data structure take the key and
decrypt this message because that key is
H key C and that is how the server can
get the message that has been sent as
the initiation of the RPC session so in
particular what the server has gotten
now is the random number that was sent
to it by Venus XR now what the server
does is it takes this random number
incremented by 1 and also adds a new
random number yr and that is a message
that it is going to send back to the
client it has to encrypt this message of
course because it is going on the wire
which is insecure so it's going to
encrypt it using a key a handshake key
which we'll call HK s and by design HK c
and HKS are exactly the same so in other
words whatever is the handshake key that
has been given to the client in the
clear token is the same handshake key
that the server is going to use to
communicate information back to the
client as well so it encrypts this
message with the handshake key and sends
it over to the client so what is the
purpose of this message when this
message comes over to the client the
client can decrypt this message how it's
going to use H key C which is the
handshake key that it knows will be used
by a genuine server to encode the
message and send it to that client and
so it can use H KC to decrypt this
message and once it decrypt this message
it gets these two numbers this XR plus 1
that is the original random number that
this guy sent over to the server
incremented by 1 now what is
the purpose served by this number XR
plus one it actually establishes to the
client that the server is genuine
anybody could replay a message that they
see on the wire but for this message to
have the right content what the client
is expecting is that the response that
the client is going to get for the
original message that was initiating the
RPC session is that the response from
the server is going to contain a number
that is one greater than the random
number that it sent the server in the
first place so if this number XR plus
one is what the client was expecting
then it establishes that the server is
genuine so this goes back to what I said
about authentication of the server that
is one of the challenges that the
Android system has this is the way the
virtue workstation the venous process on
the virtue workstation on behalf of the
client can establish the genuineness of
the server that this workstation is
talking to or in other words it's not a
Trojan horse that is sending this
message but it is genuine server that is
sending this message because this field
is exactly what
Venis expected it to be now what is this
number this is another random number
that the server is sending as part of
this message why is it sending the
random number it'll become clear in the
next set of communication that's going
on between Venus and veiss now once
Venus has extracted this yr from this
message what it is going to do is adding
it is going to increment it by one and
take that as a message yr plus one as
the message encrypted using the
handshake key and send it over to the
server and when the server
decrypts this message and extracts this
field it'll see whether this field is
what it is expecting it to be what the
server is expecting is that
this will be yr plus one and as the
client is genuine then the client would
have been able to extract yr from this
response that came from the server and
generate yr plus one and send it over to
the server so in other words this
message coming to the server is
establishing the genuineness of the
client because his original message that
we saw could have been just a replay
meaning somebody sniffed the network got
a hold of this packet and replayed it
but if they replayed it then they would
not have the key and they would not have
been able to decrypt this message so the
fact that the client was able to decrypt
this message extract why are incremented
and send a new message that contains yr
plus 1 to the server is authenticating
to the server that the client is genuine
just as this message established to the
client that the server is genuine
similarly this message coming from the
client of the server is establishing to
the server that the client is genuine
and this pair of communication that
you're seeing is also avoiding replay
attack either from the client to the
server or from the server to the client
in both directions we are avoiding it by
this trick of generating a new random
number for establishing an RPC session
and communicating it back and forth
between the client and the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
