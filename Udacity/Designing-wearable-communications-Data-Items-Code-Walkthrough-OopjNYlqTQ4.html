would look like with a quick walkthrough
of some of the pieces you will need to
do something similar later using the
documentation as a guide imagine we need
to transmit the number of steps detected
on an Android wear device to a pair up
phone let's open up the
mainactivity.java file containing the
wearable project we just created so it's
in the wear directory Java main activity
the data API is provided by Google Play
services so we need to first create a
connection to this API note that this
does not connect to the wearable it just
allows your app to make Google Play
services API calls so after you put this
code in we need a doll to enter a few
times to add necessary packages we also
need to create a variable to store the
connection in and we also need to
implement two classes that are part of
Google API client for handling
connection success and failure so let's
provide the implementation for those
methods here we don't have any code to
put in them so let's just leave them
blank for now now let's look at the code
used to create a data item let's create
a method send step count that does this
for us we firstly create a put data map
request and we need to specify a path
for it the path shown here is used to
reference this object and make it unique
compared to all the other ones that we
can create next we use put methods to
add an integer and long key value pair
we then use put data item to submit the
object and then we need to check for
errors with a callback to find
underneath error handling is very
interesting because it just indicates
that the object was successfully stored
locally it does not tell you if the
object was received by a remote device
yet it is totally okay for the remote
device to not even be connected when the
device connects the data item will be
synchronized later on so you will never
receive feedback that the remote device
has received it if you need this kind of
feedback you'll need to code up some
kind of feedback mechanism yourself
another analogy for this is that a
package delivery company giving you an
acknowledgement that the package has
been collected it has not been delivered
to the recipient yet it might take some
time to get there one important point is
that data items are promised to never be
lost and will eventually arrive once the
other device is paired up let's now look
at the receiving code on the phone so
let's expand the project viewer and work
in the mobile project now on the
receiver side it's quite easy to find
when new data items arrive you simply
create a service for this so let's go to
file new and service
create it with all the defaults and then
hit enter the first thing we need to do
is make sure it inherits from wearable
listener service and add dependencies
you can also remove the entire
implementation because we're going to
replace it you then override the on data
change method which has passed an array
of data events that have occurred for
each data of an object you can retrieve
the data map and then extract out the
path and values for each key from before
you can see here that we're looking for
a change
we're then extracting up the path we're
testing if the path equals a certain
string and then we pull out the integer
and long value to do whatever we want
with it
the final step is to adjust the
androidmanifest.xml on the receiving
side to make sure our listeners service
handles the by and listener intent
Google Play services will then handle
all the necessary behind-the-scenes work
to get the data items to your listener
you don't need to start the service
yourself so let's expand the project and
open up the androidmanifest.xml file the
final step is to adjust the
androidmanifest.xml
on the receiving side to make sure our
listener service handles the by and
listener intent Google Play services
will then handle all the necessary
behind-the-scenes work to get the data
items to your listener you don't need to
worry about starting this service
yourself oh and one more thing let's go
back to the sending code and talk about
large items data items are typically
limited to about 100 kilobytes so make
sure you do not exceed this size however
if you need to send something like an
image it's possible using the asset
class you convert your bitmap into a PNG
byte stream and then store it into a
data item using put asset this deals
with sending the image in a way that
works around the hundred kilobyte limit
so that's it for sending data items the
fundamentals are really easy and most of
the hard work like handling the
connections and sending the data is all
taken care of for you so you can focus
on the important parts of your app
instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
