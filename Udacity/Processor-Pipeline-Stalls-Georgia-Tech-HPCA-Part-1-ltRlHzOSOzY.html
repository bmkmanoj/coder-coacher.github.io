stalls and how they can happen let's say
we have a five stage pipeline and this
is where we fetch the instruction then
we decode it and read registers then we
use the ALU to compute the result of the
instruction then we access memory this
is a load or store instruction and then
we write the result of the instruction
to a register this is what happens in
cycle one cycle to cycle three etc
suppose we have a load instruction here
in our pipeline and it's going to load
into r1 something from memory while they
slow this in the ALU stage here
computing the address so it hasn't
accessed memory yet suppose we have an
add instruction that needs to use the r1
and this instruction is already reading
registers here so that it can compute
the result in the next stage and we have
a subsequent instruction here let's say
another add that adds our two to one and
produces r3 so now the problem is that
this add here is reading the wrong value
of the register so if we let it proceed
further because in the next cycle this
load will be here and now it's actually
accessing memory but by then it's too
late this add if it moves here we'll use
the value of r1 that is the wrong one
it's the value of the r1 before the load
actually produced the value and this is
where we get a processor stall pretty
much what needs to happen is the add
needs to stay here until it gets the
correct value of r1 from the load
because the add is stuck here the next
instruction also needs to stay where it
is because it cannot move here that
means that in our pipeline now we have a
bubble just like we did in the
production line we can have more than
one bubble because of a single
dependence between instructions so in
this example next cycle the load has
loaded the value from memory into r1 and
is now writing that value to a register
the ad needs to
beat the read of r1 because in this
cycle here it still didn't get the
correct value of r1
although the load was now loading that
value from memory the r1 was not written
yet so now the load is writing the add
repeats the read and because the add is
still here the next instruction is still
stuck here and that means that we have
two cycles worth of stall in this cycle
it could be that for example the load is
writing to r1 in the first half of the
cycle and this add is reading r1 in the
second half of the cycle so next cycle
the add can move on but it could be that
the load actually takes a full cycle to
write the result in which case we will
have another cycle of stalling so let's
suppose that we can do this that we can
write our 1 and then read it in the same
cycle if that is the case then next
cycle which is cycle 4 we will have the
load leaves the pipeline the pipeline
bubble here moves forward in the
pipeline this pipeline bubble moves
forward in the pipeline and now the add
finally moves on so the next instruction
after this ad can move on we can fetch
the next instruction and so on so as you
can see here a processor pipeline stall
creates a problem because normally every
cycle after the load leaves every cycle
we would have the next instruction leave
but in this case after the load leaves
there are 2 cycles worth of pipeline
bubble that finish before the next
instruction so really instead of just
having one cycle for the load 1 cycle
for the add and so on to finish we now
have one cycle for the load 2 cycles
worth of not finishing anything and then
the add and so on and that causes our
pipeline to have a CPI of more than 1 if
we count these three instructions one to
three instructions will finish over five
cycles three cycles for them and two
cycles for the bubble so really our CPI
is significantly larger than one a
processor pipeline may also need to be
flushed this is an example that we
didn't have in our car assembly line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
