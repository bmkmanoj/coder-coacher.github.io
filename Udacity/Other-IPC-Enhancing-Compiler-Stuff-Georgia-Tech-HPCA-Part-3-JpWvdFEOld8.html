discuss some other IPC enhancing
compiler techniques that we will not
discuss in detail but you can find
techniques like this in more advanced
compiler classes the first technique is
software pipelining it's a technique
that helps schedule loops like these in
a way that doesn't greatly increase the
code size but it allows us to get the
effect of unrolling many times again I'm
not gonna discuss this technique
completely but the idea of it is to
treat the loop as a pipeline where this
is the first stage this is the second
stage this is the third stage and so on
and then schedule the code so that we do
the last stage of at read it duration
while doing the second stage of the next
iteration and the first stage of the
next next iteration why do this this way
well because here we have dependencies
whereas here we don't this store here is
storing a value to which we have been
adding in the previous iteration of the
loop and this ad is using the value that
we have loaded in the previous iteration
of the loop and so on so it kind of
forms a pipeline out of the loop and
then it allows us to do parts of
different iterations concurrently with
each other and another technique that is
very powerful is trade scheduling you
can think of trade scheduling as if
conversion on steroids conceptually we
take a code that has branches because of
15 else's and other things we find what
the common path through this code is and
the blocks that are on the common path
are then put together like this without
the branches in between now we can
freely schedule instructions in between
these and we also put checks if the
common path is not being executed for
example here what if this path should
have been executed if that happens we
branch out of this scheduled code and at
the point when we are branching out
because we have intermixed these
instructions we first have to fix it
basically undo the effects of
instructions that we shouldn't have done
so the compiler needs to create some
code that compensates for that then we
can execute this block that should have
executed and then we execute the next
block that is on the common path but
we cannot execute it here because we
have interchanged these instructions and
then we can jump to the continuation of
this so simply we form a likely trace we
execute that with an excellent schedule
but any departure from the trace
requires us to not only execute
instructions in a slightly less
efficient way because we couldn't
reschedule as well but also we need to
execute some compensatory code basically
fix things that we messed up by
reordering instructions again this is
not the full explanation of trace
scheduling I just wanted to give you
some idea about how it works but if
you're interested in techniques like
software pipelining and trace scheduling
then I strongly encourage you to take an
advanced compiler class where these
techniques will be discussed in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
