there's only two positive charges I'll
call them q1 and q2 and in this case
they're both positive but they could be
negative or one of each it turns out
that the electric potential energy is
equal to some constant K times q1 times
q2 over are now k is just a constant its
value is nine times ten to the ninth and
maybe you can tell me by doing your
dimensional analysis skills what the
units are but that's for the forms what
this equation tells us is that well if
the charge is bigger either these
charges the potential energy increases
proportionally the distance of
separation is bigger the potential
energy decreases proportionally the
derivation for this equation is actually
really fascinating something we won't do
here but it basically comes from the
idea that there's a certain amount of
work required to move these charges from
very very far away into this
configuration and that work happens to
be equal to this so let's do some quick
practice let's imagine that q1 is
actually a minus charge of one Coulomb
negative one cool and q2 what's a
positive charge of three coulombs and
let's say the separation between them
was two meters so I need to tell me the
potential energy I've already filled in
the times ten to the ten because that's
what your exponents going to wind up
being when you convert this to
scientific notation so can you just fill
in this part here what the potential
energy ought to be and be very careful
with the sign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
