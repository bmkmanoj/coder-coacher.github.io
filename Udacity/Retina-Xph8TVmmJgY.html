cones are not evenly distributed right
there are many many more red and green
ones than there are blue ones remember
we're talking about that and we say that
most of your color vision is based just
upon the ratio between the red and green
and the blue is just there to give you a
little bit of sort of sensitivity to
blue but you don't really have high
resolution in the blue channel if you
were to take a look in your eye well not
your eye because this has to be a
Deadeye so some other eye or your eye
after you're dead if you want to donate
your eye when you're done just send
Megan a postcard if you peeled the
retina and you stick it under electron
micrograph if you take a look at that
you see to you see that as you moved
along the eye it was not the same
everywhere in the middle which is there
refer to as a phobia about one and a
half degrees you see this magnificent
hexagonal packing of photoreceptors okay
so X agonal pack so it if you will the
pixels in the human eye are not on
square grid but they are on a grid there
on a hexagonal epact grid and the
regularity of this is pretty remarkable
right i mean it gives you a very good
sampling a very dense and regular
sampling of the underlying visual field
which is one of the reasons that you
have such good high resolution up here
and really lousy resolution out here you
see so I'm looking straight at Megan
wake up okay good so I'm looking at I
can't really tell how many fingers I'm
holding up I mean I happen to know of
course because they're my fingers so I
can tell there's seven of them but or
whatever uh but I can't if you do that
yourself just do it this way if you want
to have a partner look look them
straight in the eye and have them bring
their their fingers in you'll see the
fingers are there you can have them
wiggle them but if you if they ask you
how many fingers are they holding up you
can't really tell till it gets pretty
close and yet you feel like you've got
all this high resolution vision out here
that's an illusion that your brain is
creating for you out here in your
periphery you just have good sensitivity
to motion in fact wiggle your fingers
you'll you'll see them right away why
might you want to do that well maybe you
want to saccade your eyes over there so
the system is very good
detecting motion in the periphery and
controlling the eye to look at it and fo
VA ting on what's there but you actually
only have high resolution in this very
small area in the periphery as shown
here you have a few large cone so the
cones are actually big and they're
giving you overall color information and
then you have this high density again of
rods so with low levels of illumination
you can still see out really well there
let's take a look at this picture so
this picture is degrees from center so
temporal is off to the side nasals
towards the nose and the first thing
you'll see is that you've got all these
cones that are mostly in the middle in
the fovea that's exactly what we said
notice the same way we have rods out in
the perfect notice you don't have any
rods in your phobia oh here's your blind
spot right you don't have anything there
that's why it's blind so what would one
of the implications be of having no cone
no rods in your phobia it would mean
that you don't have very good low-light
perception in your phobia and here's
another experiment you can do some night
go outside when there's a bunch of stars
some that are really bright some that
are less bright see if you can find a
star that's less bright that stays there
till you look at it when you look at it
directly it disappears and that's
because your phobia can't see the low
light that your rods do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
