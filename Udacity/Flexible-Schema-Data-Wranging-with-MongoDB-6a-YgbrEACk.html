some entries or documents will have
fields that others do not in any project
the data model usually goes through
several iterations MongoDB was designed
to address both of these issues by
providing a flexible schema that deals
well with both individual documents that
vary in the fields they contain as well
as the schema for our entire collection
needing to change let's take a look at
person infobox data as an example now
for nearly everyone it probably makes
sense to include fields for birth and
death dates maybe nationality and even
profession but not everyone will have
held office and not everyone is
associated with a political party and
even if we're talking about people who
are not famous some people will have
spouses some will have more than one and
others won't some will have children and
some will not leaving aside the question
of what is the right data model for
person data in MongoDB we can represent
each person using the fields that are
appropriate to them even if some person
documents contain fields that others
don't have MongoDB is indexing system
and query execution system take this
into account so we can query a people
collection for people with two or more
children and it will work as expected
retrieving only data for people that
have two or more entries in the array
that serves as the value for the
children field ignoring documents with
fewer as well as documents that don't
have a children field at all what this
also means is that it's easy to evolve
your schema as new needs emerge or more
data becomes available it's a simple
matter to begin adding documents to a
collection that have new fields you now
want to track or to change the way you
model existing fields as an example of
this let's take a look at the dbpedia
page that describes the data sets that
are available now if I scroll down this
page and I've already done that here we
have an example for city data so so far
we've looked at automobile data person
data and now city data from the info box
data set now I'm showing this example to
illustrate the fact that the schema for
City infoboxes has evolved we can see
that in this old example for Innsbrook
and comparing it to the new example for
ensberg and if you look through this
data there are a couple of places where
the data has changed there's no mayor
listed here as there is here
and while there's no time zone listed in
the old form of the data the time zone
both central and daylight savings time
are listed here small differences but
these are the types of subtle changes
that we would expect to see in a schema
that is evolving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
