list of existing customers and the
second is a list of prospects that you
bought from a company we want to reach
out to the prospects to turn them into
customers but we don't want to contact
people who are already our customers the
problem in this scenario is that we need
to eliminate our existing customers from
the prospects list however given that
there probably isn't a nice ID code to
match on between these two files then we
need to find a way to join the data sets
on other fields we can use the name and
address fields but what we find in
practice is that we don't get good
matches between names and addresses
representing the same people because
they're frequently spelled slightly
differently and Andrew Mayne at 25 state
st for Street is not going to join with
Andy main at 25 state street spelled out
in full so this is where fuzzy matching
comes in fuzzy matching is really
powerful and it'll enable you to join
two data sets together we're a regular
join may fail fuzzy matching identifies
non-identical duplicates of a data set
by specifying parameters to match on the
values don't have to be exactly the same
because fuzzy matching uses algorithms
to score how similar to words or phrases
are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
