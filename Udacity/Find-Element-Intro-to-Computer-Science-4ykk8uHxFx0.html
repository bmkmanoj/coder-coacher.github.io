confident that you understand lists you
understand the operations we can do on
lists and you understand how to use for
and while to loop through elements of a
list for this quiz we're going to try
something a fair bit tougher than what
you've seen so far your goal is to
define a procedure name find element
that takes two inputs the first input is
a list can be a list of any type of
element and the second input is a value
which can be of any type and it outputs
the index of the first element in the
input list that matches the value that's
passed in as the second input so one of
the things you should think about when
you define a procedure is whether there
any special cases that it's not clear
what you should do in this case the
question as I've stated it so far
doesn't explain what to do if the input
list doesn't contain any element that
matches the value that's passed in as
the second input we'll change it to make
that more clear and we'll make it behave
like the find method that we saw in
strings so if the element doesn't exist
we'll return negative one so here's a
few examples so if you call find element
passing in as the list the list one two
three and passing in as the value to
match the number three we find the match
here which is positioned two so the
output should be two if we pass in as
the list the list containing the strings
alpha and beta and we pass in as the
element to find the string gamma
there's no such element in the list so
the output should be negative one so
there are many different ways you could
define find element using the things
that we've seen so far see if you can
find a way to define it that has this
behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
