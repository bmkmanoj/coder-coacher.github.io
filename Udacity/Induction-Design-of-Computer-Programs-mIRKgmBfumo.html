my cases where I have recursion and
eliminate any possibility for infinite
recursion now there's two possibilities
in the star function and the plus
function those are the two cases where
regular expressions have recursion but
now star I defined in terms of plus so
all that's left is to fix plus to not
have an infinite recursion and here's
how I define plus basically I said that
X plus is defined as X followed by an X
star and the X star is in turn defined
in terms of X plus the problem was that
I was going through and saying okay for
X when i'm doing plus of optional a for
my ex I want to choose optional a ok I
think I'll choose the empty string and
so I chose that and now I'm left in a
recursion where I have the next star
which is defined in terms of X plus and
I haven't made any progress I recursive
call that's defined in terms of itself
and we know in order to make sure that a
recursion terminates we have to have
some induction where we're reducing
something that makes sense here that
what we're going to reduce is our set
ends and one way to guarantee to do that
is to say when I'm generating the X
followed by the X star let's make sure
that the X generates at least one
character and if we can guarantee that X
generates a character then when we go to
do the X star we've reduced our inputs
and so we have this inductive property
saying that now our set of NS will be
smaller and it's smaller by one each
time and if it started out finite and we
reduced by one every time then
eventually we're going to terminate so
let's see how we can implement that idea
of saying every time we have an X plus
we have an X and an X star we have to
choose at least one character for X and
note that that's not limiting us in any
way it hasn't stopped us from generating
all possible expressions because if we
were going to generate something would
have to come from somewhere either from
this X or this X and we might as well
make sure it comes from here rather than
adding an infinite number of nothing's
before we generate something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
