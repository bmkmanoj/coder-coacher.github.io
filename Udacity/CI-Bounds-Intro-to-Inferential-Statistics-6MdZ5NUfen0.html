that's why this entire lesson is pretty
much on confidence intervals let's just
analyze a good old normal distribution
so here we have ninety-five percent well
if 95 per cents in the middle then that
means 2.5% is here and 2.5% is here so
what's the z-score here if you look at
the Z table and look for 0 point 0 to 5
or 2.5% you see that it's at negative
1.96 so Z is negative 1.96 here and
positive 1.96 here so zero point 13 can
either be 1.96 standard deviations above
the mean like it is here if this were
the population distribution see zero
point 13 is 1.96 standard deviations
above musa by or zero point 13 can be
1.96 standard deviations below the true
population mean so if this sample mean
is 1.96 standard deviations below the
true population mean then this true
population mean would be the sample mean
plus 1.96 standard deviations away and
you found that one standard deviation is
0 point 0 24 however if the sample mean
is actually greater than the true
population mean then the true population
mean is 0 point 13 minus 1.96 standard
deviations and then if we calculate what
these values are we get 0 point 0 83
approximately and point 1 77 so then our
interval estimate for the ninety-five
percent confidence interval has a lower
bound of 0 point 0 83 and an upper bound
of 0.1 77 now really quick always
remember what these numbers mean most
numbers have units of some sort this is
the ratio of minutes watched of all the
lessons to total minutes available so
we're predicting that if I incorporated
this music
lesson then the entire population of
8702 students will watch between 83
thousandth and 177 thousandth of all
content available so if we set it up
like this and we want to know how many
minutes students will watch out of every
60 minutes available 60 times point 083
is about five minutes and then on the
upper bound they could watch up 20 point
one seven seven minutes for every minute
available and out of 60 minutes that's
about ten point six two since we found
that the engagement ratio right now is
point zero seven seven that's about 4.6
two minutes watched out of every hour of
content available then according to our
calculations we're pretty sure that this
musical lesson will increase the amount
of video watched to at least five
minutes and possibly up to 10.6 two
minutes for every hour of content
available so if all of this actually
happened then we could say that my song
increased the engagement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
