interrupts and signals let's see how we
can visualize these concepts will use
again an illustration with in a toy shop
where we will try to make an analogy
between an interrupt and a snow storm
warning and a signal in a battery slow
warning the reason for these two choices
is to make it a little bit more similar
with the interrupt being generated by an
event that's externals to the CPU so an
event that's external to the toy shop
whereas the signal is more generated
from within so the batteries law is
directly caused by the toy shop worker
fixing a toy first each of these types
of warnings need to be handled in
specific ways second both of them can be
ignored and last we can think about both
of them is being expected or unexpected
in a toy shop handling these types of
events may be specified via safety
protocols or certain hazard plans this
is not uncommon there may be however
situations in which it's appropriate to
just continue working and finally
situations like the fact that the
battery died are pretty frequent they
happen regularly sidor expected but or
not it is expected for a snowstorm to
occur that will really depend on where
the toy shop actually is if we think
about interrupter signals well both of
them are handled in a specific way and
that's defined by the signal handler
next both interrupts and signals can be
masked as we said and in that way we can
ignore them and finally as we previously
discussed these types of events can
appear synchronously or asynchronously
so we have some analogy between these
two contexts again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
