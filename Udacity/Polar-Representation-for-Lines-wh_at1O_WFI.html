purplish line here is going to be
defined by two quantities one of them is
just this distance D this is the
distance of the line to the origin the
perpendicular distance it's the distance
to the closest point on the line to the
origin and the second parameter so that
first parameter is D and the second
parameters theta which is just the angle
that this perpendicular makes with the
x-axis or if you want you can have it be
the angle that the line makes with the
axis doesn't matter you just have to
pick an angle so basically what we have
now is a polar representation of an
angle and a distance in such a
representation by doing just a little
bit of math you can basically see that
the dot product of any point on the line
XY dotted with the cosine theta sine
theta location of this normal is equal
to D a lot of ways to do it but
basically you can show that if you
formulate it this way that X cosine
theta plus y sine theta equals D so it's
a lot not a lot it's a little bit ugly
well it's beautiful if you like
trigonometry it's it's it's ugly if you
like algebra it's a little bit more ugly
than the y equals MX plus B formulation
but it doesn't have this problem that
any of our lines are ill-defined this is
a perfectly fine way of representing any
line you can have any direction you want
theta can go however wants to go and you
can be you go right through the origin D
can be 0 or it can get as big as you
need it to go one of the interesting
things now is if you take a look at this
equation if I know X and y what I have
left in terms of D and theta is a
sinusoid alright which is why we say
that a point in image space is now a
sinusoid and huf space and we'll see an
example of that in a minute
see before we have this beautiful
duality of a point in image space was a
line in Hough space and a point in Hough
space was a line in image space well
because we've introduced this cosines
and sines it's still a duality but it's
no longer just simply between points and
lines one other comment about this
there's a redundancy or an ambiguity
here let me draw it to you this way
here's D so if D can
only b+ this line has to be able to spin
all the way around so theta would have
to go from 0 to 2pi 0 to 360 degrees
but if D could be positive or negative
then theta only has to go from 0 to PI
or 0 to minus PI to pay my how you draw
that the idea is you'd only need a
hundred and eighty degrees worth of
coverage which way you do it doesn't
really matter in our algorithm we'll do
it in a particular way but there's just
this trade-off between if you let D go
positive to negative top positive and
negative then it only has to go zero to
PI in fact you can restrict things even
more if you make this be the origin of
your image the top left hand corner if
you're gonna say that your your line has
to be within the image okay then that
restricts even more because it has to
cut off that quadrant so theta and D are
restricted even more but these are just
choices that you make in terms of how
you code up the algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
