that you use in UML class model diagram
is generalization generalization is also
indicated by a solid line but in this
case the line ends with a triangle the
class rectangle that's adjacent to the
triangle is the superclass or parent
class and the other class rectangle is
the child class or subclass the semantic
import of generalization is that all
instances of the subclass are also
instances of the parent class that is
there's a subset relationship let me
warn you though that generalization is
not the same as inheritance in
object-oriented programming language
inheritance is an implementation
technique generalization is a modeling
approach we'll see how that difference
plays out later in the course in UML
generalization supports both multiple
parent classes for a given class and
multiple child classes for a given
parent class moreover you can specify
discriminators that is names of groups
of subclasses so here's an example of a
UML class model diagram in which
generalization is illustrated we have a
super class called vehicle note that
it's got four lines coming into it each
with an open triangle so it's got four
subclasses those sub classes are
wind-powered vehicle motor powered
vehicle land vehicle and water vehicle
notice also that we have two grandchild
classes we have trucks and we have
sailboats so let's think for a minute
about trucks trucks are motor powered
vehicles but there are also land
vehicles that is truck has two parent
classes
similarly sailboat is a wind-powered
vehicle and a water vehicle so it's got
two parent
classes as well with respect to the
parent level we have two categories of
sub classes we have a category related
to the power that moves the vehicle it
might be wind or it might be motor and
we have a category having this labeled
here as venue indicating where the
vehicle does it's moving is it on land
or is our own water also visible in this
diagram are some properties in curly
braces those properties indicate
properties of the subclasses if a parent
class has two child classes and
instances can belong to both of the
child classes we want to use the
overlapping property if that can't be
the case that is of a given instance can
only belong to one child we say that
those particular subclasses are disjoint
they're members belong to one of the
child classes not the other and but by
our definition of generalization the
instances do belong to the group to the
parent class a second kind of constraint
or property you might want to express is
whether or not the set of child classes
covers all of the instances or not if
that's the case we say we would use the
property complete and otherwise we would
say incomplete why might a modeling
situation be incomplete well you might
have some weird hybrid vehicle that
doesn't belong to any of the the child
classes but nevertheless we want to have
an instance that that recognizes it or
models it say the Segway for example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
