functional testing approach and all the
steps in this process so far we've seen
the first step and the second step now
we're going to look at this step in
which once we have identified the values
of interest we derive test case
specifications for these values or using
these values in a test case
specification defines how the values
should be put together when actually
testing the system and test case
specification describe how these values
should be put together when testing the
system so let me go back one more time
to our split program so that we can use
the information that we already computed
at this point what we have is some
possible inputs for string our first
parameter and for size our second
parameter and we want to put them
together to generate the description of
what the test case should be so let me
once more and rearrange this a little
bit I first remove the description of
the subdomains because we won't use them
in this step and I moved up the set of
our possible inputs that we're going to
combine to create a test case
specification and one possible way of
doing that is simply to combine the
values for the first parameter and the
values for the second parameter so the
Cartesian product so if we do that what
we will obtain is for example if we
consider the first possible input size
is equal to minus 1 we can combine it
with these two possible inputs for
string and we will get size is equal to
minus 1 string with length minus 2 or
size is equal to minus 1 string with
length minus 1 and we'll go back in a
second to see what this means now if we
consider the second possible value for
size size is equal to 1 we also have two
cases so the first one in this case will
be considering a string with length 0 so
the empty string and we can continue
combining this value but one thing I
want to point out is that if we just go
in this straight forward and brute force
or the way we will obtain many
combinations that don't make any sense
like for example this combination which
doesn't make any sense because we cannot
create a string with length minus 2
similar for this combination because in
by the same token we cannot create
things with length minus 1 and so
there's a lot of cases that we will have
to eliminate afterwards so what we're
going to see in a few minutes is a
possible way in which we can avoid
producing these meaningless cases and at
the same time keep under control the
number of test cases that we generate so
let's go back for the last time to our
steps for systematic functional testing
what we just did was to derive test case
specification from a set
relevant inputs the following step is to
use these test case specifications to
generate actual test cases and this is
normally a fairly mechanical step in the
sense that we just have to instantiate
what is in the test case specification
as actual test cases and it's really
dependent on the specific type of
partitions and values identifying on the
specific context so instead of looking
at that here in in the abstract I'm
going to show you with an example later
on in the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
