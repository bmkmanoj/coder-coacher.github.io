data quality metrics in a little more
detail we'll start by looking at the
validity metric here we're primarily
concerned with individual field values
for example we might have fields that
are mandatory there must be a value
there we might have fields that must
have a unique value within each data
item we might have fields with foreign
key constraints an example might be
product records each of which must have
a reference to a manufacturer and that
manufacturer must exist in our database
we might have Crossfield constraints
what I mean by this is essentially
conditions on multiple fields so for
example the start date must come before
the end date now for most fields we're
also going to be expecting a specific
data type or a particular structure of
some kind if we're talking about JSON
data where fields can have values that
are themselves dictionaries or arrays we
might also have fields that we expect
you have a particular pattern a pattern
that we can test using regular
expressions some fields will have values
that we expect to be in a certain range
this might be a numeric range that we
can do bounds checking for or we might
be talking about set membership of some
kind so all t-shirts have to have a size
field that's small medium large or extra
large auditing validity is about
determining what the constraints are on
individual fields and checking to ensure
the field values adhere to those
constraints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
