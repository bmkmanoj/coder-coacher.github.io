Java bluej and the lesson files on a Mac
I'm using OS X 10 to find this out on my
Mac I would click on the Apple in the
top left corner and go to about this Mac
that'll pop this up which says that my
version is ten point seven point five if
you're using ten point seven point two
or lower you'll select a different
download link than I do so I'm going to
select Mac OS 10 dot 7.3 but remember
you might select 10.72 or earlier I'll
click on the zip file and since I'm
using Chrome the download will show up
in the bottom left corner for me but
this might be different for you when
it's done I'll click show in finder and
here it is I'm going to drag it to my
desktop now I can see it on my desktop
I'll double click to unzip it now to
open bluej I'll double click on the
folder and then I'll double click on
bluej and I want to open it even though
it's from the Internet and this is what
bluej looks like when you first open it
now let's leave blue day for a moment
we're going to go get the example code
for the first lesson use the link that
we gave you in the written instructions
when you go to the link you'll see it
download down here again again I'm going
to go to show and finder and I'm going
to move this into my home folder which
on this computer is called Clark so I'll
drag this and now I'm going to go back
to my home folder where I just dragged
my code and I mean I'll get the lesson 1
dot zip and I'm going to unzip it the
way we did before now I've extracted the
files when they were in the zip file
they were compressed in an unreadable
format extracting them makes it so that
programs like bluej and people like us
can read them now go back to bluejay and
i'm going to go to open project under
the project menu and now i'm going to go
to the lesson1 folder and inside you can
see a bunch of folders that have bluej
icons these are Java projects that you
can open in bluej pick the one that says
hello and open it
you should get a display that looks like
this if so congratulations you've now
successfully installed Java bluej and
the lesson1 files if you got stuck
somewhere just send us a message on the
discussion forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
