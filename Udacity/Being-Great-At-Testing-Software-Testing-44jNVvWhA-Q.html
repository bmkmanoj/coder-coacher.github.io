great at testing software and this
involves a number of different elements
first of all we need to recognize the
testing and development are
fundamentally different roles even if
they're often played by the same exact
people so developers primary attitude is
I want this to code to succeed the
testers main attitude is I want this
code to fail of course the reason the
tester wants the code to fail this is
the testers and goal is creating
stronger code which at which later on
doesn't fail if we look at these
requirements a little bit we can see
that for the same person to be a great
tester and a great developer there might
be a little bit of doublethink involved
and so those of you who read Orwell well
know that the doublethink is the ability
to hold two contradictory beliefs in one
mind in one's mind simultaneously and
there is a bit of that required in order
to be a great tester and a great
developer and of course really the
conscious contradictory nature of these
two beliefs is only apparent because of
course the developers and the testers in
the end want the same thing which is to
create great software the second element
of being great at testing is to learn to
test creatively and I showed the example
earlier of testing an arm assembler and
disassembler by exploiting the fact that
they were inverses of each other and
also exploiting the fact that the arm
instruction space could be fully
enumerated and that's one thing that I
consider to be a great example of
creative testing and if we can think of
creative ways to test we've often do a
much better job than rote testing and
furthermore do a much better job than
just rote testing with the most obvious
inputs a third thing is the great
testers never ignore weird things that
they notice and it turns out that at
least in my experience it's very often
the case that we get little hints of
things wrong with the software that lead
to threads that have tugged on would
have led us to discover problems that
were really quite serious on the other
hand if we see these little things wrong
and we paper over them we ignore them we
end up not finding these problems until
until until later so I'm gonna end up
today with a claim the great testing is
a lot of fun because it's fun to break
software and it's very satisfying to
produce software that's really great
because it's been well tested great
testing can also be profitable and what
I mean here is is that testing is a
separate career at many companies like
Microsoft and the companies like Google
and Mozilla offer
Bounty's and what this means is if you
find a security critical bug in for
example google chrome they'll pay you up
to $20,000 and this isn't an author
etiquette
I was recently talking to a software
testing researcher who wrote an
automatic tester and applied it to
Chrome and to Mozilla and their research
group over the course of a few months
made about $50,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
