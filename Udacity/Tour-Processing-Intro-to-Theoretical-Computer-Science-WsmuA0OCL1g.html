can be for a variety of problems so
let's look at some possible
pre-processing rules that we could use
for the shortest tour problem now what
I'd like you to tell me about each of
the pre-processing rules is whether they
are correct that is they don't change
the solution outcome to something
different than they would be if you
didn't apply the rule and are they
effective means they don't increase the
size of the input and actually make your
job harder so the first possibility is
that we could calculate a shortest path
from each vertex to each other vertex
and then we remove all the unused edges
the second possibility is that as long
as the graph stays connected we could
just remove the heaviest edges and
repeat until the graph disconnects and
don't remove that one the third
possibility is remove any edge that has
a larger weight than the minimum
spanning trees weight and finally we
could replace long paths by a single
edge that has equal weight so go ahead
and check which ones you think are
correct and which rules you think are
also effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
