are axes here's my function f of X and
now the problem is i'm given some value
of y and i want to find the value of x
that corresponds to that such that f of
x equals y and the strategy we had
before was to just start at the zero
point and go out step by step by step
until we found it but that's going to be
slow if there's lots of steps so my
approach is going to be first I'm going
to take one step forward and then if I
if the value of f of X is still below
why then I'm going to double how far out
I go and I'm going to keep on doubling
how far out i go and checking so 1 2 4 8
16 units out and until I've got down so
here i have this value that i doubled f
of X was less than the desired why and
when I went all the way out to here f of
X was greater than the desired why so I
know that the right ax has to be
somewhere within this range so that
gives me the low and the high that I get
by doubling and now I'm going to find
the exact value or close to the exact
value within low and high by having so
first doubling now havoc so I look in
here say what's halfway between low and
high that's at this point f of X there
is still too high now I know I must be
somewhere in this half I go halfway
there that's still too high now I know I
must be in this half and I keep on doing
that process until I zero in on the
right value that's the strategy now
let's see what the code looks like so
here's my function inverse I'm going to
have my smallest Delta the smallest
amount that I move out be 1 over 1024 so
that's going to get me to within three
significant digits and I'm going to
build up this F inverse function so I
was given y equals f of X I'm going to
build up x equals F inverse of Y and I
do that first by finding the low and
high bounds it's got to be somewhere in
there and then do it doing a binary
search somewhere in between that low and
high
I to find a value that's accurate to
within Delta here's how I find the
bounds I start off and I just keep on
doubling until I find a value that's
high enough so what I keep on doing is
narrowing down the interval between low
and high until they come out to be the
same until the interval has disappeared
if I'm too high then I change the low
otherwise i changed the I value that
makes the interval smaller and smaller
if I hit it exactly I go ahead and
return the x value if I haven't hit it
exactly then I know I'm somewhere in
between the two and I just check out
which one to do now I've defined some
functions here to help me test what I've
done I've defined the square and the 10
of the X functions and now i define
those in versus the logarithm is just
the inverse of the power of 10 and
square root is the inverse of square
using the function i define can also do
cube root is the inverse of the cube
function and then i'm defining some
tests so for these sets of numbers i'm
going to test these functions square
root log 10 and cube root and i'm going
to test them against the correct
mathematical functions as defined by
Python these are the ones i've defined
with inverse these are the ones Python
defines and here's my individual tests
and here's what i get when i run the
test so for each of the numbers for each
of the functions here's the result i
compute with my inverse function here's
the actual results and you can see the
differences are all in the point 0 0 1
or less and that's true for small
numbers and it's true even as we go up
to bigger numbers like 10 to the eighth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
