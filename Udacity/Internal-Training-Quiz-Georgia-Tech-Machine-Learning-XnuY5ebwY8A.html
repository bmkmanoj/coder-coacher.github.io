where the hypothesis space is the set of
intervals so the inputs that we're
trying to learn about are just single
numbers on the real line and the
hypothesis space is the set of functions
that return true for all the things that
are between a and B and this is
parametrized by a and B so how many
different hypotheses are there in our
class here at least two sure how about
how many are there in the class there's
an infinite number of them that's right
so so this is one of these situations
where it's going to be really helpful to
apply the notion of VC dimension if we
think we'd like to be able to learn from
a finite set of data which you know
generally we like that so how do we
figure out what the VC dimension is we
want to know what is the largest set of
inputs that we can label in all possible
ways using hypotheses from H all right
so I want you to figure that out figure
out the the largest the size of the
largest set that we can shatter that we
can label in all possible ways using
these hypotheses and then just you know
write it as an integer in this box
