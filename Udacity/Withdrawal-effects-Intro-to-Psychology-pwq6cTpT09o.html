opposite direction of the effects of the
drug produces let's look at an example
of heroin so here we will list the
effects that heroin produces and we'll
see that when a person experiences
withdrawal those effects are opposite
let's start first with analgesia so
heroin produces a variety of effects
we'll just look at four one is analgesia
this means it's a pain reliever it will
also produce pupil constriction meaning
people will have tiny pinpoint like
pupils also it produces euphoria in fact
this is why people abuse heroin and
finally another effect is constipation
now a person who is physically dependent
on heroin and doesn't get the drug will
now start to experience withdrawal
symptoms and these are in the opposite
direction let's take a look so the
withdrawal effects would be hyperalgesia
which is an increased sensitivity to
pain pupil dilation dysphoria as well as
diarrhea in addition people undergoing
withdrawal from heroin experience what
they call a terrible flu leg feeling and
these withdrawal symptoms can last for
weeks therefore it is not surprising
when people go out to look for the drug
to try to diminish those withdrawal
symptoms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
