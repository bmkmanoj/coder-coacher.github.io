seeing if it's comparing two quantities
that have the same units comparing
dentists to dentists or graduates to
graduates but which quantity comes first
to answer this question I like to think
to myself how could i phrase this as a
out of be something and let me explain
what I mean when we had the statement
three out of five dentists recommend
toothpaste the tasty toothpaste our
ratio was 3 out of 5 3 over 5 in this
case 3 dentist was my a and 5 dentists
was my b or we could think of it as 3
was my a and 5 was might be but when we
had the statement out of 500 grads to
Hunter got jobs in business well I could
not say 500 out of 200 grads got jobs in
business that's wrong so I could not
write 500 out of 200 or five out of two
however I could have rephrased this as
200 out of 500 grads got jobs and
business and now 200 is my a500 is my B
and my ratio is 200 out of 500 or two
out of five so it looks like once I can
phrase something is a out of B then I
can say that the ratio is a over B let's
do a little bit of practice so for the
following ratios select which quantity
goes in the numerator three out of four
students are girls for every 17 cars on
the road to are unregistered and for
every 90 babies 32 will live to be 100
for each of these three statements
select the appropriate button for the
quantity that belongs in the numerator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
