property that we need is to provide this
collision resistance property all of
these provide the compression needed
we're taking a large input X that could
be any size we're going to get into the
size of one block the other three don't
provide the closure and resistance we
need so with counter mode the value of
the last output block is the encryption
of the last block in the message xorg
with the counter value and the knots and
that doesn't depend on any other blocks
in the message it only depends on the
last block it depends on the length the
number of blocks before that but if we
want to find that pair of values x and y
that hash to the same value well in this
case that's easy we can change any of
the previous blocks for the other two
it's a little less clear to see that the
output does depend on all the input
because we r XR in all those inputs in
the output but there are lots of things
we could do that would still allow us to
find collisions and one example with ECB
mode well we can just flip the messages
if we swap the first block of the
message with a second block of the
message the XOR of all the output box
will still be the same since with ECB
mode these will encrypt to the same
thing with counter mode this swap is not
quite as simple we'd have to adjust
what's in the block to also adjust the
change in the counter but we could
produce things that hash to the same
value so none of these would work the
first one is actually pretty close to
what traditional hash functions used and
it's a construction known as the Merkel
damgaard construction which is quite
similar to CBC mode encryption since
it's a hash we don't need a secret key
we can use the same key for each step so
we could select the key being zero there
are some subtleties to make this work as
a hash function and in fact there's a
lot of controversy today about how well
hash functions work the ones that were
considered the standard until recently
was a hash function known as sha-1 this
was a standard accepted by NIST and
people have found ways to find
collisions in sha-1 there is an ongoing
competition to select a new standard
hash to find a replacement to find a
hash function that is closer to
achieving these properties and it's
expected that the winner will be
announced in 2012 there five finalists
currently on
consideration we're not going to look
any more in detail at how to construct a
modern hash function instead we're going
to assume that we have an ideal one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
