this one is called a bar graph the
spaces between the columns here mean
that each of these is one distinct
category Europe is completely distinct
from North America completely distinct
from Asia and we can't mix them but with
age we can choose any interval or bin
size and so that's the next really
important difference you can change the
bin size for age data but not for the
country data we could make our bins from
0 to 80 in which case all the students
would be in that one bin but we can't do
the same for this unless we make it
world or something different we could
divide it into hemispheres but we're
still more restricted with this type of
data than with the age data and finally
the order of the continents doesn't
really matter
however age is just in one order from
least to greatest with the bar graph we
might choose to put it in a particular
order depending on what question we're
trying to answer such as where are most
students from then we might put it in an
order from least to greatest or greatest
to least or we might choose to
alphabetize it so that viewers can
easily find what continent or country or
whatever they're looking for on the x
axis and finally the shape of a
histogram is very important whereas the
shape of a bar graph is arbitrary
depending on how you choose to order the
categories on the x axis one thing to
remember is that with a histogram the
variable on the x-axis is numerical and
quantitative whereas with a bar graph
the variable on the x-axis is often
categorical or qualitative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
