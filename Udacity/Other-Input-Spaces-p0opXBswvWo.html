talking about regression in the context
of a scalar input and continuous output
sorry
scalar input and continuous input so
basically this X variable but the truth
of the matter is we could actually have
vector inputs as well so what would
might what might be an example of where
we might want to use a vector input a
couple of things one if we look at the
housing example like we said earlier
there are a bunch of features that we
weren't keeping track of so we could
have added some of those great yeah we
could include more input features and
therefore combine more things together
but how would we do that so let's say
for example that we have two input
variables that we think might be
relevant for figuring out housing cost
to size which we've been looking at
already but also let's say the distance
to the nearest zoo we think that that's
a really important thing people like to
live close to the zoo and so probably
not too close to the zoo possibly not
too close to the zoo
but let's but let's imagine that it's
like sighs something that actually or
actually let's do it the other sort of
imagine that the that the further away
from the zoo you are the better it is
just like the bigger the size is the
better it is so how do we combine these
two variables into one in the context of
the kinds of function classes that we've
been talking about well if we think
about lines we could just generalize to
planes and hyper planes right so in the
case of of a one dimensional input that
one one-dimensional input gets mapped to
the cost but in the case of two
dimensional inputs like saw size and
distance to the zoo we have something
that's more like a plane we combining
these two things together in a in let's
say in a linear fashion to actually
predict what the cost is going to be so
right so these this notion of linear
functions generalizes this notion of
polynomial functions generalizes to very
very nicely alright there's another kind
of input that's important to that let's
think about a slightly different example
to help drive the idea home so let's
imagine that we're trying to predict
credit score what are some things that
we might want to use as features to do
that do you have a job I do actually
oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I misunderstood
so you're asking oh so you're saying one
feature
could be important for predicting
someone's credit card is yes or no do
they currently have a job right
another thing might be well you could
ask instead how much money they actually
how much how many assets they have how
much money do they have credit cards
great so so right so things like what is
the value of the assets that they own
right so this is a continuous quantity
like we've been talking about but
something like do you have a job yes or
no is a discrete quantity and one of the
nice things about these kinds of
regression approaches that we've been
talking about like polynomial regression
is that we can actually feed in these
discrete variables as well certainly if
they're if they're boolean variables
like do you have a job or not it's you
can just think of that as being a kind
of number that's just 0 or 1 no I don't
have a job yes I have a job what if it's
something like you know how many houses
do you own that's pretty easy because
that's you could just treat that as a as
a quantity a scale or tech quantity what
about are you type of job type of job I
like that
how about hair color so yeah how would
we do that if we if we're trying to feed
it into some kind of regression type
algorithm it needs to be a number or a
vector of numbers and they can be
discrete so right so how do we encode
this as some kind of a numerical value
well we could do something ridiculous
like actually write down the RGB value
which would make it kind of continuous
interestings insane but you could do
that or you could just enumerate them
and just assign them values 1 through 6
in this case right 1 to 6 or they could
be vectors like is it red yes or no is
it beige yes or no is it brown yes or no
have it be a vector and actually for
different kinds of discrete quantities
like this it can make a difference right
so in particular if we just gave them
numbers then it's kind of signalling to
the algorithm that blonde is halfway
between brown and black which doesn't
really make sense we could reorder these
actually the RGB idea doesn't seem so
bad to me except of course right have an
interesting question of what's the real
RGB value it implies that somehow
interpolating between them makes sense
that's right that's right it also
implies an order right it implies that
the scalar order of
RGB is somehow mean something that it's
no different from saying red as one in
beige is two so if we multiply it for
example by a positive coefficient then
the more RGB you have the better or the
worse right mm-hmm interesting though in
fact what I had in mind here is for RGB
it's three different hair colors I
thought that you stood for green
there's people don't have green hair
they have gray hair but I thought that
gee and RGB stood for green yeah it does
usually but I'm making a hair joke oh oh
I'm sorry
I'm glad you explained it you know
Michael no problems I really I really
like the boolean vector I do yeah so I
imagine that we're gonna return to these
issues when we start actually encoding
problems as machine learning problems I
think you're right but I think that's I
think that's enough said about
regression for the time being I agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
