rational unified process phases are
fundamental aspects of this process and
we just touched on them so we just gave
a quick overview and I want to look at
these phases in a little more detail so
what I'm going to do is for each phase
I'm going to discuss what it is what it
produces and how is the result of the
phase supposed to be assessed and what
are the consequences of this assessment
so let's start with the first phase the
inception phase the first phase goes
from the idea of the product to the
vision of the end product what this
involves is basically to delimiting the
project scope and making the business
case for the product consider why is it
worth doing what are the success
criteria what are the main risks what
resources will be needed and so on
specifically this phases answers three
main questions the first one is what are
the major users or actors to use the UML
terminology and what will the system do
for them to answer this this phases
produces a simplified use case model
where only a few use cases are
represented in described so this is the
sort of initial use case model the
second question is about the
architecture what could be an
architecture for the system so in this
phase we will normally also develop a
tentative architecture so an initial
architecture that describes the most
crucial subsystems finally this phase
also answers the question what is the
plan and how much it will cost to answer
this question this phase will identify
the main risks for the project and also
produce a rough planning with estimates
of resources initial planning for the
phases and dates and milestones
specifically the inception phase
generates several deliverables it is
very important that you pay attention so
that you understand what these
deliverables are starting from the first
one which is the vision document and
this is a document that provides a
general vision of the core projects
requirements key features and main
constraints together with this the
inception phase also produces an initial
use case model as I just mentioned so
this is a use case model that includes
an initial set of use cases and there
will be later refined
two additional deliverables of the
initial project glossary which describes
the main terms using the project and
their meaning and the initial business
case which includes business context and
success criteria yet another
deliverables for the inception phase is
the
she'll project plan which shows the
phases iterations roles of the
participants schedule and initial
estimates in addition the inception
phase also produce a risk assessment
document which describes the main risks
and countermeasures for this risk
finally and this is an optional
deliverable in the sense that it might
or might not be produced depending on
the specific project as part of the
inception phase we may also generate one
or more prototypes for example we might
develop prototypes to address some
specific risks that we have identified
or to show some specific aspect of the
system on which we are insured to the
stakeholders so basically all the
typical uses of prototypes that we
discussed before so when we are done
with the inception phase we hit the
first milestone for the cycle that we're
currently performing and so there are
some evaluation criteria that will tell
us whether we can consider the inception
phase concluded or not and the first of
these criteria a stakeholder concurrence
which means that all the stakeholders
must agree on the scope definition and
cost schedule estimates for the project
the second criterion is requirements
understanding are they initial the
primary use cases that we have
identified so far the right one for our
system another criterion is the
credibility of the cost schedule
estimates the priorities defined the
risks identified and the countermeasures
for the risks and the development
process that we're following finally in
the case we produce prototypes as part
of the inception phase this will also be
evaluated and assessed to judge the
overall outcome of the phase so what
happens if the project fails to pass
this milestone so if the outcome of the
inception phase is considered to be
inadequate with respect to one or more
of this criteria well at this point
since we are kind of an initial phase of
the cycle the project might be cancelled
or considerably
referre so to summarize all of this in
one sentence the inception phase is the
phase in which we produce the initial
vision use case model project plan risk
assessment and possibly prototypes for
the project and we have to make sure
that all of these deliverables satisfy a
set of criteria so that we can continue
on the project and otherwise we'll
either cancel the project or rethink its
scope or other aspects of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
