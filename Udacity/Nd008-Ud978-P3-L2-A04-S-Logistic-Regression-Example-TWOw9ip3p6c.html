in an input data tool and connect to the
hotel loyalty data that CSV file the
data has been aggregated to a customer
level and has many variables about these
customers the first thing I'm going to
do is connect to a select tool that
allows me to view the structure of all
my different fields since this data came
in as a CSV they over read in as word
types are strengths but as we know we
have a few different variables that are
actually numeric so we should change
those field types to numeric types the
other fields are fine to leave as
categorical variables as word types are
strings after this I'm going to go to my
data preparation category and build
estimation and validation samples using
a create samples tool within this tool
you choose how many records are the
percent of records that you want to have
in your estimation sample your
validation sample and the residual is a
holdout sample so by default I typically
choose seventy percent for my estimation
sample to build my model off of and
thirty percent of my data to then
validate my model off of anything left
over that is less than a hundred percent
goes into my holdout sample as you can
see a hundred percent of my records were
consumed with the estimation and
validation samples so nothing is going
to be within this holdout sample I'm
going to run this workflow right now so
you're able to see it yourself what we
can see is we have almost 1600 records
in our estimation sample so that's
seventy percent of our records well the
other thirty percent is in our
validation sample which is about almost
700 records and like I mentioned before
nothing should be in our holdout sample
but let me just confirm that now so now
that we've changed field types as well
as creating different samples of our
data set I want to bring in a logistic
regression till now to build out my
first logistic regression let's first
name the model we can name this whatever
we want but i'll call it hotel
underscore log for logistic regression
I'm going to select my target variable
and remember the target variable is what
we're trying to predict so that's our
Redeemer field and then lastly we'll
select the different potential predictor
variables so for this first run of the
logistic regression I'm going to choose
all my different fields minus the
customer ID field since that's unique
for all my different customers the first
name and last name since I highly doubt
those have any sort of predictive
ability to my Redeemer field as well as
we needed a deselect our target field
which is the Redeemer field I'm now
going to bring out a browse tool after
our our our report output so I'm able to
view the results and run the workflow
now the other result is the 0 which is
the model object this is going to be
used later to validate our model and to
score our model now let's notice that
the results look exactly the same as
they did for a linear regression and
they're using the exact same way
actually the first thing I typically do
is I go down to my r-squared value as
you can see my r-squared value is at
Point 62 43 which is quite high now if
we look a little closer at these results
we notice that almost none of the
different variables are listed as
significant for our predictor variables
we can see this because there's almost
no asterisks in the last column this is
an indicator that this variable is not
very important to the model and it
likely should not be included at all or
it needs to be modified before it can be
effectively used within this model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
