important role in computer systems in
fact when we talk about computers we
often say the operating system running
on a certain kind of computer a Windows
machine or an iOS device we're going to
see that operating systems play an
extremely important and in fact a
critical role when it comes to
protecting and securing resources that
we have in our computer systems so let's
look at what a computer system is
actually so we actually start with the
hardware your hardware consists of a CPU
perhaps you have memory and other i/o
devices so that's the hardware that we
have now if you wanted to use the
hardware directly it's going to be
pretty difficult in fact no one does
that what we really do is run a really
important program actually operating
system is kind of a program that handles
the low-level Hardware resources that we
have so this your operating system may
be Windows or Android or a number of
these operating systems what we
generally start with the hardware run
the operating system on that device that
we have and the applications that we
directly deal with that we run on our
system so this could be your browser
let's say or this could be your mail
client so these applications then
actually running on top of the operating
system one way to think about this
picture that we have for a computer
system is that hardware is where we have
the real or physical resources we're
going to run an operating system to
control access to those hardware
resources and those resources then are
going to be made available to the
various applications that we have so if
any of these resources had to be
protected in case we have different
applications running here the reason the
operating system plays a really
important role is because the operating
system gets between these applications
and how they can access the resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
