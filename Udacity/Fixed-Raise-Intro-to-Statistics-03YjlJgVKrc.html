understand variance which is the spread
of the data
squared you understand standard
deviation which is the same without the
square and you have a way to compute all
of those in a single pass to the data
using only these running counters
that's quite profound you're really deep
into statistics now so let me ask you
two tricky questions this is a secret
please don't tell anybody but I'm
actually considering it is
hypothetically to give everybody a raise
and we're likely to ask is what the
effect of the race is on the mean and
standard deviation of the distribution
of salaries in the company I'm
considering two types of raises a fixed
amount or $1000 and what's called a
relative rate of 20 percent now that
changes the mean and or the standard
deviation to potentially different
values they're call mu Prime and Sigma
Prime and the change is either
multiplicative which would be the factor
over here or additive if there's no
malakut of change just put a 1 over here
can you guess what the effect is of
adding $1000 each salary on the mean and
the standard deviation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
