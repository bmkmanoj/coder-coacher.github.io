shirred economics well that was right
you know you both have an economic
reason to wanna partner but you know
what number two is right as well
economies of scale you partnering with a
much larger company means you could take
advantage of their supply chain or their
volume discounts or the massive sales
force they have and you know number
three is right as well
large companies but just by definition
because they're larger have more of
everything than you do want to be great
if you get your hands on some of it
somehow
and number four boy access to customers
now we have three million customers and
today you have three that's a good idea
too
and then finally access to their
marketing or their brand wouldn't be
great to have the you know General
Electric label or the Intel label or
beyond you know a Facebook partner next
to yours and so the answer is they all
apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
