intro to programming webcast my name is
mark and to my left is my name is Jonah
my coaches here at Udacity are hope ever
wants to be well this today this in
August month so hopefully for some of
you it's sunny weather I know it's not a
weather here in California it is raining
in LA it was ready in LA pretty crazy
there was flooding so hopefully we could
get more rain but not in the flooding
kind in more in California so today
we're gonna be talking about the topic
of planning an entire website from front
to back and this is the more higher
level of presentation we're not gonna
dive too much into code not too much
into implementation of this code because
that that deserves a whole lecture or
even a whole series of lectures in
itself what we're gonna do is we're
gonna give you an overall overall
overview of the lay of the land like the
force we're gonna show you the bigger
picture of how you start thinking about
a website and what are the things that
you need to think about and platform so
and these are three things that we're
gonna be really learning is that when
you walk away from this presentation
when you're gonna learn the crucial
components that make up a website and
then you'll be able to answer the big
questions involved in planning out
website you're gonna know the
technologies require in order to deliver
content to the Internet user and you'll
be able to know how to research what
technology you need to implement after
this presentation so basically it's
after this presentation you'll be able
to walk away knowing on a good general
level of what needs to get done and you
may not hear yourself let's of
programming you may not know everything
that you need to do but you at least
know what needs to get done and then
you'll be able to research get help hire
someone um
contract out some work and you'll be
able to at least know at the minimum you
know when you're talking with an air
programmer you get
with them and relate to them like what
you need to do that's really half the
battle it's like knowing what you need
to do it's like once you have an idea of
everything you need to do in the steps
to do it
executing is not nearly as hard as
figuring all that out so making sure
that you have this framework set up
beforehand makes life a lot easier later
on I totally agree and I'll take daresay
90% of the programmers job is just we
forget because researching you're just
figuring out how to orchestrate and put
things together um before we start even
further lists we have a couple quotes
just a little pencil they come as a
surprise
Brendon Hastings has an interesting
question uh will it be possible to get
this recorded and yes we are currently
recording if you're watching it right
now you probably it's recorded most
likely so it will be on the Google Plus
page and you can access at any time it
also will be put on the course later at
some date and then there's a whole list
of them a link to which will be on the
Google Plus page yeah also well post our
transcripts or our notes in the
discussion forums as well so there's the
only plenty of ways for you to access
this video recording yeah and then we
have another interesting question a very
practical question from cam soojeong and
they asked in general which job is more
highly paid front-end developer or
back-end developer that's that's so
that's you can't really answer answer
that question because it's tough it
there's so many other variables just
because you're thinking you you have a
skill set in a front-end technology or
Mac and take technology because depends
on how good you are as a person
defense is how much you know and depends
on what's important for the current
company right now if they have an army
of back engineers well and if they only
have one ending e1 lead front-end
engineering you may have a more valuable
your position may be more valuable
versus vice-versa so and also depends on
your region to where you first read that
you you're talking about if you're
talking about you know corporations who
need a Java back-end developer
and they may pay a little more but then
if you're if you we're gonna start up
they may pay an equity they make pay in
stock options so they're it's it's a
it's it really depends and there was
there is no answer to this question it's
it's tough I think that if you're trying
to decide between being front end and
back end hopefully this presentation
actually help you since we're gonna
cover both sides I mean you can look in
and be like oh I'm a little bit better
at designing things and understanding
how how users interact with things or
maybe you're like oh I'm a lot better at
understanding databases and how things
connect together then in that case you'd
probably want to be a back-end engineer
so this will probably this might help
you think about which path you wanna go
down yeah and I like John I like your
comment of like losing what you like and
what you're good at
yeah and that your natural tent what's
your natural tendency and honestly at
the end of the day you you work up to do
the and you gain them enough expertise
that it's more about like liking your
job and liking what you do forces just
getting paid exactly and being good at
it like it and you're good at it you
probably the money will follow honestly
like if you're lucky and you really good
it the money will just follow but it
shouldn't be just about purely money -
thank you all right let's move on all
right so can you screen share yeah your
life
alright I'm live so we're gonna use
Prezi to present and yeah so let's just
get started planning a website from
front to back
understanding understanding the big
questions to help you plan your website
and the first thing we need to actually
really align everyone on I think is to
make sure that okay let's align one and
ask ourselves what is it looks like good
question
what really is a website Jonah so like
for most people a lot of people think a
website is just a page of information
there's pictures and there's text I just
put a URL like uh you know I go to
google.com I go to yahoo.com
newyorktimes.com to get information and
it did and match there's a lot of magic
magic happens and I get information it's
like my universal library right so
that's what a lot of people think I mean
back in the nineties that's what it was
which is just a way for us to access
information from library but you know
the what the Internet has evolved so
much that this more than just static
pages now and I I would I would like to
you know talk long with that more about
the definition of a website and really
the definition that I think is for me as
a from a programming side right now not
just like a normal user but it's like
it's a framework for delivering content
whatever we want to deliver music videos
news whatever it is whatever information
is is a framework it is a system it's a
system made of a series of small little
you know components that deliver this
content to our users and that's really I
want to line everyone on about this
definition but what set because it makes
it easy for us to understand the
components of a website and in therefore
it makes us understand the variables
that's involved in planning on making a
website because in the end we are
orchestrating where you could think of
us as orchestrators we're here to
orchestrate and also in basically link
small though components together that
deliver our website let's see oops let's
go back here yeah and and like I'll just
like tell you right now like we're the
crucial components of a website and
these are the things that come off the
top of my head really these are the main
basic components like HTML CSS user
design JavaScript web server
administration daily basis caching
server endpoints these are all the big
big-time components that you want to
think about when you're designing
website and these are the components
that actually make up that help you
deliver the content over website and
really it's there's a lot of components
and it's a lot and to help us as
programmers to categorize and figure out
okay how to organize our disinformation
we often tend to put these components
into two categories the front end and
the back end and this is will be the
most common terminology that you will
ever hear in your programming your web
development program career even
programmers in general the front end and
the back end and the front end really
involves the case of anything that the
user sees the browser the design of the
page the Java scripting of the page
anything that the user sees in the
browser that's front-end design like all
those components such as HTML CSS you
just user design that's Fred front-end
development
now there's another side called the
backend and that's where no one sees no
one really like that your users they
don't really see them they don't really
see the servers and the computers that's
actually pushing this information and
delivering this content to your users
because for our back-end development
it's all about Mehcad the servers are
running correctly the server's can
actually deliver content to your browser
to the front-end the backend could
access the database and make sure that
it returns the appropriate request that
the front-end or the user will have
towards our our servers so basically
that's that's really two things two
categories that you really need to think
about in a nutshell it's the front end
and the back end let's see and now we're
gonna move on to the front and Jonah
you're gonna your I'm gonna let John to
explain more about the front end and all
the components that we should think
about yeah absolutely so front end is
usually what you know as Mark said the
first thing that you see when you land
on a website and as such it's also one
of the first things you want to start
thinking about when you're planning your
website it's the most visual component
and it's where everyone's familiar with
like it's designed when they communicate
with your website it's always through
the front end so you want to make sure
it's clean its well-designed and
everything works from the users
perspective so the questions you want to
think about our colleague am lay it out
where are the image is gonna be where is
the text gonna be how is how is
everything gonna be laid out basically
another thing you want to think about is
what sort of content so if you have like
a new site you want to think about okay
I'm gonna put articles in I'll put
videos in and I put maybe user responses
in and then I think about is how is
either gonna interact with this page so
if it's Facebook you
you just gonna login they're gonna
comment on their friends posts they're
gonna like somebody's pictures that's
what I think about when we talk about
user flow and interaction and then the
last component I don't want to say last
because it's definitely very important
is the color and graphic design and
we'll talk a little bit more about why
why that's important later so one of the
most important tools that you want to
start with before you do anything is
these two these two things pen paper you
know you can do it on your computer you
can design things but I find that it's
really easy to get distracted on that
computer in this stage so it's best
sometimes to just grab a piece of blank
paper and start drawing things and when
I talk about drawing things I mean
drawing boxes so you talked earlier
about how HTML is all made up of boxes
there are nested boxes but everything's
laid out in these these square things so
what I have here I could take a good
next mm-hm today yeah okay cool so let's
look at the New York Times this is an
average website you'll go to it and it
looks cool you have some information but
you look a little bit deeper you can see
that it's actually made up of boxes like
everything else and I use this tool
called Wi-Fi there to make this all
together so you'll see that the header
here is a box the video on the front
page is a box the article title is a box
and it's all laid out in this fashion so
that it's easy for us to think about
things abstractly because it's easy to
get caught up in small details when
you're planning a website so you want to
start big scale where do I put things
and then once once you have these things
you want to think about what goes in
each of these boxes so the top is
probably the most important thing that
the user is gonna look at hmm so we put
the header there like the New York Times
did it scroll next yeah so I put the
header there and then the next thing
that's probably you're gonna look at is
the thing right in the middle
Paige that's gonna be like your video or
something and next you're gonna think
about we're gonna put your article so
it's important to think about where the
U is gonna look when he or she lands on
your page and this is sort of part of
the visual flow and you want to think
about putting the important parts
central and then auxiliary parts on the
side so you notice that New York Times
does this really well and it's actually
based really closely on the actual New
York Times newspaper and that's not just
because they're trying to emulate print
media it's people have thought about
this before and web design sort of has
followed in the footsteps of print
design to some extent so it's important
to think about how you can relate to
print design when you're designing a web
page and New York Times I think is a
great example of this so let's see
what's let's yeah so when you have a
little bit more complex things like
popular posts this isn't something that
you can just put on your page so you
have to start thinking about what each
box is going to do in terms of the back
end so you can see that we're already
starting to transition from the front
end to the back end at this point you
have to think about what sort of code
each element is gonna use so I put in
HTML 5 for the video right there and
that's that's my that might be a way
that you can put in a video into your
page and I'm gonna you I'm gonna throw
around some terms here that you might
not be familiar with um but it you'll
learn them as you go through um we're
just sort of thinking about things in a
higher level right now
and if you look at popular posts you
can't just write out the post and expect
it to refresh automatically it's going
to have to connect to a database in the
background so as you go through make
notes and be like okay I have this
popular posts box on the right I'm gonna
have to have it connect to a database
later on and I should start thinking
about how I want to do that and then as
far as user interaction you want to put
like a login box maybe somewhere where
the user is gonna see it quickly
so the top right is a great place that
the New York Times puts it and then you
want to think about also what sort of
code is this going to use it's probably
use some JavaScript some CSS and then
you you want to keep this in mind as
you're planning these things cool so the
wire framing stage is really useful for
thinking about colors you'll see that
right now everything's in grayscale and
as you're writing out these boxes you
can put things in different shades as
you put them in so lighter shades will
be lighter colors darker shades lead
darker colors and you might not think
that colors are that important going
into your pages like oh it's just
cosmetic but the colors and the layout
and the graphic design and everything is
very important when you're looking at a
page when I land on the page that's not
that important and there's bad graphic
design I want to leave it so if you have
like if you ran into this yeah yeah
there's some sites where the colors were
just awful yeah exactly so companies
spend millions of dollars sometimes
redesigning their websites yahoo has
gotten through it Spotify just did a
redesign you know it's best to start
with the good design so that you don't
have to go back and redesign everything
and it makes the navigation easier it'll
make your website more pleasant to use
and it'll make it more likely that
people will come back and use it later
which is really just the goal on the end
so as I said you can shade things to
make sure that the contrast is good
a good rule is to group things that are
similar shaded with each other so you'll
have dark things on the right as you see
and then a great thing in the middle and
then dark thing at the top and contrast
is good it'll draw your eye to it but
you don't want to overuse contrast yeah
so once you have this all laid out
you're basically done with your
wireframe you can sort of see how this
comes together in a neat way and at this
point you have to think about whether
you want to design things
yourself or outsource it because it can
take a lot of time to do it yourself so
it might be more valuable to ask
somebody else who's better graphic
design or you might be more personally
invested in your product so you want to
design it yourself how you run to like
having to delegate things and doing
sites or young person who actually I'd
like to do editing in house yeah so
you'll sometimes fire see me fire up
Adobe Illustrator record to actually
design my logo or just yeah create my
own graphics but yeah absolutely
what's more for me yeah I like complete
control over my life yeah yeah
absolutely I mean that's that's cool um
and if you want to have control over it
that's that's a crucial thing for a lot
of people and then other people maybe
their their time they want to spend it
more on making sure the the bat camp
works so that's that's sort of about as
much as you can do in the front end
stage and this will set you up really
well to do more things later on so
something else that is pretty important
in front-end planning is thinking about
what sort of frameworks you might use so
you can build a site from scratch you
know you can build like the New York
Times just like coding yourself doing
every single line or make reddit but
there are these things called software
frameworks and it really helps us to
speed up the development process
basically it takes all the things that
other people have used before and puts
it into a prepackaged set of of code so
CSS we have frameworks like bootstrap
pure CSS and cascade and these are sort
of like prepackaged mmm what are some
examples of things that frameworks and
give you like login buttons login
buttons color scheme color scheme
layouts that's a big thing grid yeah
responsible it design too as well
definitely it's all like duh for like to
put the breakpoints for like your phone
tablet and
so yeah it's all programmed in for you
yeah great so mark made a really good
point there about um
mobile design so when you're programming
something on your computer
it's easy to just get caught up in
programming things just for the computer
but using these frameworks like
bootstrap help you to think ahead about
making your website look good on a phone
or a tablet which is gonna be huge in
the coming years and it's already huge
right now so yeah are you actually
working rim recommend if you're starting
off your career you know doing front-end
stuff like after this degree you may
want to create your own personal website
I really recommend you just start off
mobile first and that's that that's
actually a big macho right now in the
front-end web development community so
we're tell you right now it's all about
mobile first design and I'm I'm starting
to design to design mobile personal site
and it's mobile first I'm actually I
shadow I'm actually starting with light
the the width for width and height for
an iPhone 4 okay and I just want to say
okay how this is looking on the phone
I'll start there and then I'll blow I'll
blow up and easier for me to start small
because I only have limb to mouth space
and I need to focus on exactly what I
need to display efficient and get very
efficient and then once I blow up once I
have I go on to design from the desktop
yeah 1024 pixels then I have all this
real estate then I could figure out okay
I have all my important things now what
else can I come at yeah
what would I blow up right and we have a
couple of questions so let's answer
these question yes I'm running into
these um so when you're designing things
Daniel asks do you have to allow for all
the ads in a design that's good thinking
it's really good actually is very good
good thinking monetization is important
and yeah thinking about where you want
to place ads is important you don't want
to have it you don't wanna have pop-ups
what is this 1998 you don't want to have
banner ads that flash at you you want to
think about ways to incorporate ads so
that it's unobtrusive but still
useful so yeah when you're boxing things
out maybe have a box for a net and just
put it on the top right so it's still
focal but not the main focus of your
site so yeah think about think about as
think about monetization mmm I'm using
this word if monetization is just soar
like how are you going to make money
from your site easily yeah if you're if
you're let's say a blog right yeah
you're a blogger you want to make some
money off your hard earned work well the
ads is actually a very viable option
definitely for like a blogger mm-hmm and
you know you don't have to sell out you
know you can link to maybe of something
thats related to your blog like if
you're doing a blog about travel maybe
you can link to something that some
company that makes like travel
accessories maybe help your readers out
be like oh yeah when I was traveling I
used this cool keychain that lets me
charge my iPhone shoutout okay so we
have another question here from cam and
asked is a full-stack developer job
scope mean that the person will cover
both front end and back end job tasks if
it is doesn't mean that the full stack
developer logically should be more well
paid than the front end back end alone
actually I was thinking about this when
when you asked that question earlier and
that's that's still a really difficult
question to answer she's a little
difficult because a whole stack
developer can never be as good as a
front end who's just cost try focus on
the front end and a back end person like
who's just a wizard in database
administration and lighten things up you
can never be as good as that yeah so
again it comes down to the variability
of what does the company need now and
how good are you and if you could you
could say like I could be a full stack
developer that is amazing a front and
back which which is its we call them we
start calling them unicorns a little bit
there Gert it's it's a little bit yeah
it's
it's hard for a reason and if you feel
like that your skills can often exceed
of a full front-end person for his
forces and a full backup person then
yeah yeah it's good go for you you'll
get pay more but then that depends on
your own skill level and your own
experience not necessarily you being a
full-stack developer so they're like I
have I do not have these statistics to
back up my cloning master yeah I do not
have any numbers to tell you but you can
yeah you can probably find it on say US
Census if you want to get more granular
information
Glassdoor probably Glassdoor probably
give you I'll say senseless I'll say
it's just like because they had like a
spot for front-end developers to have
software developer so they're like I I
hope they have like they bucket that out
to back in full stack but I will say
since this is more statistically
relevant this tree versus glass door
where you can your just pick your just
cherry picking it straight like a lot of
your posts and articles that you're
reading off so again it's hard it still
depends so like if you have further
questions on full stack we we actually
had a webcast else at Mary last week so
I take a look at that I highly suggest
you take a look at that and if you guys
still have further questions on that
sort of stuff we can definitely post
your questions on the forum and well
we'll find a full stack coach who who is
more who can get you to the resources
and information that you need a couple
more questions your honor move on
they're actually addresses quick let's
move on a little bit okay we'll come
back to the questions in a little bit
yeah all right so that's the front end
so again take away from the front end we
have design and we have frameworks so
when you think about your front-end
pickup design first how are you gonna
lay out everything and how you know from
a general picture a bigger level how old
does everything
however they look how do you plan on
everything looking out because then you
can then figure out the technology the
frameworks that could help you drive
that design now let's
to the back end and if you're gonna walk
away from the back at one lesson that or
one thing that we should all walk away
with is this crucial question well our
content be static or dynamic what does
that mean static dynamic and static is
just the information will not change
depending on any user like I just wanna
you know right um yeah just write a blog
yeah write an article that article will
never change you may of course you may
edit proofing it add some addendum to it
but for the most part it will not change
much throughout the life of that blog or
the life of that article so do you need
technology do you need programming
interface servers to actually change
that article depending on whatever
inputs whatever factors you probably not
cuz you write an article it's static it
doesn't change it's not dynamic so if if
all the content will indeed be static
then that makes the next question is a
whole lot easier to answer because these
questions will involve and how how much
horsepower and how much dynamic
interactive interactivity they need from
the back end because but again if it's
static you could just literally write
your code in HTML and then just find a
simple lips web host yeah it actually
hosts that server
yeah host your files on the server and
then you're done that you don't need in
order support technology now if the
question is dynamic then that will
actually help drugless further on what
how much dynamic power do we need yeah
so let's move on so that's the first
clicker question it's a compass is
static or dynamic because basically
we're gonna talk about three things now
I look at my notes
basically we're talking about we're
going to we're going to talk about
server hosting you know what what is
where can we find a server that could
host our web pages and there's tons of
them and shall we yeah what's up is
hosting is there is providing and the
type of services the type of dynamic
services or even static services that we
need like does our back-end server need
to put in an Excel API requests or does
the backend server need to host a
database as well access some data for a
user and then give it to that user
example a banking website I tell you
right now a banking website has a very
very powerful back-end server yeah
because guess what there's a lot of
money involved it it has to like access
very secure databases to access your
money and it has a ton of services for
you to be able to go in ahead and change
your address do it do a wire transfer
let's draw some money deposit some money
add in a check schedules recurring
charges that's that's a lot of services
and that requires a back-end technology
down act that has to be very secure it
has to be very robust it's may secure it
also has to be easily usable exactly oh
it's for the backend also for the front
of people so basically usually you have
a front-end person who takes care about
the front-end stuff and then he or she
will talk with a back-end person who
takes care of all the databases and they
talk with another and say hey what's
your API endpoint and I need some
documentation of when I set up my Ajax
requests send off my requests on my
front end to be able to get the data I
need for her for what I need to do so
there's constant communication between
the front and the back in person if the
if that person is not like a full-stack
person who's doing both and this third
thing I'm be talking about is the
technology stack and this is a very I'll
say it's it's this important thing to
understand it's also an important thing
to understand the vocabulary at Domingo
of when when we're talking with other
above developers
okay so server hosting there's three
categories of
hosting one I call this easy hosting
this is the combination of free hosting
and shared hosting now let me backtrack
and let's let's define what hosting yeah
hosting is basically I have I create my
web page on my own local computer but
now I want to being able to go ahead and
upload my files so everyone knows
connects can access on the Internet
usually it's a big pain if you wouldn't
want to dealer so if you if you want to
hook up our own local server in our own
house to serve which still do that but
then it's it's we don't recommend it
because that's more for advanced person
user to actually set up their own
hosting also more prone to error and
like ranking storms rain storms you're
bettin yellow cable shuts off well then
your your or your computer your computer
shuts down well then guess what your
server no one will be able to access
your website and if you're if you want
to make some money off your website it's
good to actually host this out and find
a host to actually you pay them because
you pay them a fee a nominal fee for
them to take care of the servers if the
servers go down they have someone they
always have someone 24/7 365 days a week
to make sure that the servers are always
running yeah and they also have the
bandwidth that that you need because
basically your own little internet
provider on your house won't be enough
to say serve thousands of people yeah
who maybe who may be accessing your
website so that's how advantages of the
hosting so basically recommend fun hosts
yeah so actually it's somebody had a
question about that yeah just answer it
is great and there are some there are
some I feel like there's some places
where you can host your free
yeah post for free but then they force
you to either host your own that's right
right so yeah ad supported hosting yes a
supported hosting so like the ads that
you don't necessarily
want them to show well tough luck cuz
they'll not force you to host those ass
instead of you paint and I recommend you
just go ahead and pay pay now if you
want a more streamlined user experience
now there's like yeah like there's some
great smaller hosting sites well going
to that later but Squarespace I think
yeah is created like server space I
don't know if it's a free I don't think
so okay for sure good help is free
github is free yesican um I love the
page is free yeah that is completely
free for developers just want to host
your own website and it is static
perfect yeah I actually personally will
do that myself if I were to just host
static web pages I don't need to do any
I need I don't mean any back-end support
yeah I'll just go to github cool poke
you know push my changes and there we go
so that's easy hosting and that's really
good for static web pages now once you
level up let's say let's sweet let's
assume that we need some more technology
to host let's say we want to create a
forum posts
or like a calf or impatient like Reddit
or any other forums that you guys see
discussion forums you guys to discussion
forums yeah or even say a banking
website right you're gonna need some
more horsepower you're gonna need to
actually have access to the server
itself and actually install and set up
all the software that's needed to
actually host the server yeah and host
the web page it's like virtual private
server or a dedicated hosting site this
is actually for people people these are
people who have full-time jobs like
these Linux administrators and these are
people who actually set up things for
other people and this can be a full-time
enough for a lot of people and if if
you're if you feel like you want to get
to this space and learn how to do that
and by all means I encourage you and
yeah just there's tons of tutorials out
there to learn how to stuff you know set
up a server like a web server like using
Apache and send that up in Linux but
yeah basically that's the second
and if this is the cavea you need to set
up everything yourself all they give you
is just a server a box somewhere in in
the world Arizona Arizona New York
wherever that's served and you have
fruit you have root access you have
access to that server 24/7 remotely and
you'll be able to type in a lot of
basically a lot of terminal commands to
be able to actually stop the server FTP
upload your files to the server and just
you sell everything and that that of
course that costs more money because you
are basically renting a server it's a
whole computer to by chance and this
actually if you're having more than a
couple of thousand people yeah that's
when you start needing some more
horsepower yeah to actually serve and
then third this is called
platform-as-a-service this is actually a
combination of easy hosting and also
dedicating uh I'll say virtual private
server hosting and if you're a
programmer your developer you want to be
able to like say you know create a forum
or create a banking website you need
some back-end support that actually
handles all the database requests well
then it means that you can either so
step things up yourself or actually just
use a platform as a service where they
actually tell you okay
we're does set up everything for you all
you need to do is just upload your code
this is Google App Engine so for the
people who are at add in stage for what
you're using is called a platform as a
service hosting and that's that's called
yeah that's that's hosting your you host
it and yet for like one day you have
like basically I think a gigabyte board
a free bandwidth anything else and
they'll start charging you I know yeah
so like it's it's free to to just play
around use for good first yeah for the
first few thousand yeah people who will
access it it will be free and that's a
platform as a service where you just
upload your Python code your back-end
code which we'll talk about next in our
back-end technology they take care of
all the server setup you don't need to
even touch
a terminal they take care of all the
database setup and they take care of all
the redundancy that redundancies that's
needed oh yeah Oh usually is yeah upload
your code focus on developing your
application and then that's it you pay
them on nominal fee and if sure you blow
up that's great you scale up you just
scale up and you know hopefully if you
scale up you'll make more money and then
you'll be able to pay off more more of a
server costs graduated strapped yeah
great so that's server hosting so
depends on again the question of is a
static it's a dynamic content and what
level of dynamic content do and you
really need what little horsepower Jenny
for my website not good before we move
on class can answer a couple questions
do it so one question about the net
degree itself is this certifications in
this or just experience only or for what
we're talking about
I'm not quite sure yeah I think what is
dis yeah I think this I think Tina's
talking about front-end and back-end of
development so you that's what there is
there are two nan degrees called the
front end down degree and then the whole
stack male dude that actually you'll
dive into detail of how to develop the
front-end the back a back-end yeah so
yeah i really suggest you just you if
you're more interested and investigate
the full stack in the front end now and
agree to be able to get a to figure out
how she should do this now all this
house because what we're tell you is
what and why well we're not gonna cover
is the house that that that takes a
whole than degree that's the degree that
takes that's the whole certification
classes for you to take so hopefully
that will help guide you yeah and as far
as getting experience you can do it sort
of on your own start building websites
that's really the best way to gain
experience without being and the job and
yeah so let's see who else a couple more
questions on the framework as Ruby on
Rails considered a front end or
can tool select that Ruby on Rails is a
back-end tool its surfs websites but it
it doesn't handle the HTML the actual
designing of the HTML CSS in JavaScript
it just is basically like your Python
that you're learning in stage 4 to serve
your websites
Ruby is the programming language and
rails it's a framework okay okay web app
2 is your framework that we're using
Python interesting ok as far as the ads
go yes the sites have ads everywhere
because they want to make a lot of money
so it's it just depends on how much how
many ads you want to put on your page
correlates to how much money you're
gonna make off of them also the user
experience new user experience yeah like
how much of like Jose my question is how
well do you want the user experience to
be and I understand the ads are
necessary if you want to make some money
it's just that you can you can still be
smart about it you can still try to
integrate those ads into your website
and then as far as like as that the
hosting company puts on your web page
you have less control over how many go
on and it depends on the hosting company
as to whether you can control where to
put those ads but then again just it
just depends good question there's a lot
of push it's not really practical so
Connor asks does the use of frameworks
reduce the need to know the Dom like the
back of your palm yes so mapping
everything out is is a way to reduce
memorizing everything it's so you have
everything on one page you can refer to
this when you're going through and
building your website you're like okay
I'm gonna start with my topmost div and
like this is that box and then I'm gonna
start with the header div and that's
this box so when you go back to it to
you'll be like oh mmm this is this div
within that div and then you can find it
in your code
and you don't have to memorize things or
dig really too deep and it saves a lot
of time so a great question yeah though
I always say that don't let don't use a
framework and don't depend on it for
so much they will become a crux mmm I
tell you right now if a lot of a lot of
people say they know say the front-end
stuff I've heard this word toss with my
mic another front front end people a lot
of people say they know jQuery but they
did they don't know JavaScript that
should be reversed actually another
thing if they say if you study a
nutshell jQuery you could basically deal
a lot of stuff with jQuery but then if
the need arises that this framework
doesn't quite do what you what it can do
it's just a framework it's just a way
for you to do things in some sort of
idealized environment yeah you have to
resort to actual learning JavaScript
knowing the actual JavaScript and
knowing how to access the Dom in
JavaScript know how to access those
notes so I would say yeah it does reduce
the need for you to know the Dom or the
document object model like the back of
your hand and highly recommend I use
frameworks all the time for myself but
you should not depend on it too much or
else it will be a crux and if you're
trying to find a job in front-end or
back-end
what developer they expect you to know
the Dom and they expect you to know how
to manipulate the Dom using just playing
straight jobs straight JavaScript CSS
HTML yeah good point
mm-hmm all right all right let's move on
let's move on so the next thing that I'm
going to talk about is oh services
basically this is based like once we've
chosen our host or type of host we need
to figure out what is it exactly that we
need to do what's this what's this
service when I say service I mean what
is it that the backend server supposed
to take in from the front end and was
this supposed to output if there's a
running theme and there's intro to
programming now and agree it is what's
you always think to ask the question
what's the input and what's the output
what's the input to the server like what
are the was the type of information that
our back-end server
is getting from the front end okay this
is the type of information I need like
say let's draw this down like say a
banking website I need to know your
account information I need to know your
login information I need to know how
much money do you want to transfer all
those little inputs and then at the
output okay what what's my output what
what am i producing what am I trying to
do say let's say for a banking website
for my output I need to most likely need
to access some sort of database to
change that account balance if someone
needs to give me an input withdraw or
deposit $200 I need to basically process
when when a person logs into my website
I need to process their password and
compare it to a database password
database and make sure that it's correct
if it's correct then I
give a let them uh login you know send
them look a valid a to cook in and
they'll be able to login so those are
the thing big things that you need to
consider what are your big services that
your back-end is trying to do again if
your if your back-end
if it's just serving a static web pages
then that's really the one service just
serving the web page like the input is
request from the browser and the output
is it will just send you the HTML code
that's that's your that's your input and
output for your back-end for a static
web page now dynamics there's a lot of
things that's happening and then you're
gonna need programming language actually
help process the inputs and outputs
which is actually next thing is called a
technology stack hmm so we have three
things in the technology stack so the
first thing is some people have
mentioned programming languages what is
the programming language like that we
want to use what's that what what's that
basic technology yeah you're learning
Python in stage four and that's where
that's where of course stack that's your
core technology that you'll be using to
process inputs and outputs but then
there's a lot of other programming
languages that other people use to call
java.net Ruby nodejs PHP a lot of people
write I will say PHP ASP and PHP is
actually really old
yes throwback it's so bad but it's it's
actually uh it's a server-side
technology you run code on your server
and then it spits out the HTML so again
what's your stick what's your
programming language what's
once you figure out that out you could
then figure out okay depending on my
services what's my database there are
two schools there are two big types of
databases right now that you should
really just need to think about is
common relational databases my sequel
post-grad sequel that's a sub common
those are two free databases that you
can install in your server and use and
then there's some other the
non-relational database is called no
sequel MongoDB how do Cassandra and
those are that other type of databases
that do not
depend on putting your data into you
know a traditional spreadsheet like
table again based on your experience and
based on what what you need
you may choose let's say a MongoDB
server because you don't you just want
to read things really fast and you just
want to be able to go ahead and just put
if just store information like like an
object like then that's what we're using
in stage 4 Google stays sort it's it's a
nose is no sequel type of database
versus or more relational database and
now relation that database is there
they're old-school there they are they
are older and but they're different
reliable and they're very normalized
meaning that they actually if you
organize your data very well it works
very well and it's you know it's the
performance of the thesis well though
you know once you scale up relational
databases start here not hitting a wall
and especially if you are trying to do
joins in your tables it's it gets a it
gets really slow if you trying to do
outer joins inner joints or anything
like that like off like a two million
record database things start slowing
down so I will say yeah depends on what
you're familiar what type of database
system day you want and you know like
how are you gonna scale up that's you
may even use a combination one part I'm
going to use no sequel MongoDB to host
my user accounts and then another part
relation will use that to store in my
the rest of the information I have about
my users so what depends there's most
trade-offs on relational and no sequel
database and then the next is server
operating system now this is um this is
really what you're familiar of servers
are operate on Linux but there's a
sizable number of number of servers that
operate on Windows and why should you
care well it just makes it apparent that
you you need to know the type of
technology that you can work with let's
say if it's a Linux then
expect to work a lot in the terminal mmm
the command prompt and but with Lennox
you have a lot of free software that you
could just install on your computer and
run with it versus windows most likely
you're gonna use a software a Windows
self recall is or our proprietary which
is prior part like internet if Internet
Information server is called microsoft
iis got the acronym the Laura stands for
but yeah it's all for Part Picard
Tyrannis I think it's AI is okay good
look that up an update there are notes
but yes our proprietary other servers
Oracle you know HP Dell they may have
their own special system but again it
depends on how much you're familiar with
your server and how flexible do you want
your server to be so we're about the end
of our little presentation here so let's
let's just have a little summer here so
John just let's just can you summarize
another thing yeah yeah we covered the
big ideas and design by making a website
look good and work well which is laying
out all the boxes that you have either
on paper or some sort of graphics
program in your computer we laid out the
user interface so where do you want the
users to log in or do you want the users
to post comments we talked about which
boxes you want to put those in and what
sort of technology so you want to
connect to those we also talked a little
bit about graphics about whether you
want to design things in-house outsource
them and if you do decide to design them
in-house what sort of things you want to
think about as far as ease of looking at
it oh like in terms of contrast and how
to lay that out in your in your sketch
in wireframe we also covered JavaScript
and CSS frameworks these they're sort of
pre bundled software that you can use to
help your development move faster and
work better and work with a lot more
capabilities than you probably even
that and that sort of wrapped up all the
things that you want to think about when
you're planning the front inside of your
webpage and then we sort of transition
into back-end yeah so three things that
you need to know about the backend how
are you going to host your content is
your contest static or dynamic that will
really drive your the rest of your
decisions on trying to figure out the
backend part of your website the top of
services oh do you need a database do
you need to have API endpoints do you
need to have user accounts like about to
lockup to log in do you do you need all
that what's up with like things that
will deserve I actually do and then last
is the technology stack really what the
programming language is we're to friend
whatever work you're gonna use what's up
a database system we use and also what
type of environment server operating
system the environment will you use cuz
a lot of people wall all of developers
will actually ask you so what's your
tech what's your stack
what's your technology stack and um I'll
give you an example a classic stack is
called lamp Linux Apache my sequel PHP
so I'm using Linux I'm using a Apache
Apaches the software to actually on a
server actually serves the the website
I'm using my sequel that's my database
I'm using PHP is my my programming
language a lot of people could say Oh
pearl
he's a pearl if you just also use Python
to pearl as your as your a tech stack as
well
another's tech stack is me Mongo
database express framework angularjs and
and is no js' nodejs is your back-end
it's actually written in JavaScript so
you're using javascript to actually
serve your web pages as well in addition
to actually using javascript to
manipulate your webpages on as they get
the front end talking about manipulating
webpages
yum there's a question actually about
what that means to manipulate the Dom
through JavaScript right so the Dom is
basically it's called the dog on top
novel and it's basically you could think
about but a tree right it was like as an
abstract tree where you have elements
belonging to other elements in your HTML
and if you think about it you without
JavaScript there is no way for you to
manipulate the Dom or change the Dom
live the only way for you it the only
way for you to say change the
relationship or change like say change
want like say add in a paragraph right
into a division there is no way for you
to do that without actually having to
open up your editor edit the HTML code
and then reload the web page yeah can't
do that every single time you can't do
that every single time especially for
use but like let's say that you want to
program something interactive or you
want to dynamically add in a paragraph
in the website you will use JavaScript
to actually manipulate the Dom to make
sure you manipulate it and you actually
add in a paragraph inside the website
itself live so when the person loads up
your web page they may not have that
paragraph inserted but then if they do
if they click a button then the button
will actually launch a javascript
function that will actually go ahead and
insert a paragraph element inside are
some sort of a div element container
element so that's what we mean when we
say manipulate the Dom yeah that's great
great is a really nice diagram you know
I really sort of close together yeah
everything that you need to think about
and planning above so yeah thank you
thank you so again these notes will be
posted hopefully by tonight or tomorrow
so they will be posted on the discussion
forum so please just log on to the
discussion forums and look at the
categories and then look at flip for the
office our notes category and you'll be
able to go ahead and look at our notes
you know highlight them week them
reflect on them digest them and then
yeah if you have any further questions
on whatever we presented today yeah
possibly in discussion forums thank you
very much for your time thanks so much
for coming all right thank you okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
