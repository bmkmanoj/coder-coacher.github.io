process works you walk up to a
workstation and you log in and how do
you log in well you log in using your
username and password and the login
process is special that runs on the
virtue workstation it communicates with
the login server that is inside the vise
by presenting the username and password
in a secure fashion we'll see how that
is done in a bit so it presents the
username and password securely over the
insecure links to the login server and
the login server once it authenticates
who you are using the username and
password it is going to send you a pair
of tokens and remember all of this is
happening on behalf of the user by the
smarts in the virtual workstation the
user has to do nothing special all that
the user is doing is logging in using a
username and password under the covers
these things are happening first the
login process communicates securely with
a login server presenting the username
and password and the login server then
returns two tokens one is called a
secret token the other is called a clear
token the clear token is a data
structure once again I have to mention
that both the secret and clear tokens
are communicated back to the login
process by the login server in a secure
manner over the insecure links we'll see
how that is done in a minute
so once the login process gets these two
tokens decrypt them and gets these two
tokens the login process decrypts the
message that contains these two tokens
and extracts the clear token and the
secret token the clear token is really a
data structure which is known to the
login process and the data structure in
particular contains a handshake key
we'll call it HKC so from this clear
token data structure the login process
can extract this handshake key and the
secret token is just a bit
three so far is the login process is
concerned the weight is generated by
this login server is to encrypt this
clear token with a key known only device
it's not the same as HKC it is a key
that is known only device to encrypt the
clear token and we will see how this key
is going to be used later on
so to recap virtual sense securely the
user name and password to the login
server login server securely sends
secret token and clear token back to
this login process from the clear token
the login process extracts the handshake
key and the secret token is basically a
bit string which is an encryption of the
contents of this clear token encrypted
with a key that is known only device in
other words the secret token is unique
for this login session and it is a bit
string which means nothing to anybody
that sees it on the wire and therefore
we can use this bit string that secret
token represents as the ephemeral client
ID for this login session recall I said
we don't want to expose the user name
and password too often on the wire this
is Andrews answer to dealing with that
problem by providing an ephemeral client
ID for this login session once a user is
logged in they get an ephemeral client
ID which is the secret token and this
can be used in the future communication
between virtue and vice as the client ID
now how will vice know who is
communicating with it
when it sees this bit pattern remember
that this bit pattern secret token is an
encryption of the clear token and the
key for decrypting it is known only to
vice so when the secret token comes as
the client ID wise can decrypt it and
find out
from that what is the clear token
associated with that particular bit
string which is representing the secret
token and once it knows that it can also
extract the handshake key that it gave
to a particular client and that's how
the identity of the client that is
communicating with the vise in the
future presenting this secret token as
the ephemeral client ID can be
recognized by vise
so now after the login is done for all
the future communication between Venus
and vise HKC can be used as a private
key for establishing a new RPC session
this pair of tokens the secret token and
clear token is stored on the virtual
work station by Venus on behalf of this
user for the entire login session at the
end of this login session these two
tokens will be thrown away by Venus but
during the login session these two
tokens are representing this particular
user that are logged in and so for the
duration of this login session Venus
will use the secret token which is a bit
string that represents this particular
user for this login session as the
client ID to send information over the
device and any information that Venus
sends device to establish an RPC session
is going to be encoded with the private
key that has been handed now through the
clear token data structure that is the
handshake key that has been given as
part of this login exchange through the
clear token data structure at the core
of the entire secure RPC system of the
Andrew file system is the bind mechanism
for setting up a client-server
connection securely and that's what
we're going to look at next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
