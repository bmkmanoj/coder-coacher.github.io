let's see where you are you want an
upper bound on time you took the dag and
you broke it up into a bunch of phases
and each phase K does W K units of work
and the time to execute each phase is
the ceiling of wk over P and it's these
pesky ceilings then we want to get rid
of let me help you I don't want you to
be angry like this little guy
here's a fact I can take a ceiling of a
quotient and turn it into a floor plug
that in and see what you get
hmm now I know what you're thinking
cursive ooh duck that gets rid of the
ceiling but the floor seems just as bad
I remember our original question was to
get an upper bound so can we get an
upper bound on the sum and now the floor
of something is always less than or
equal to that something ha ha
that gives an upper bound and eliminates
the floor no I'm falling into a pit okay
this looks a lot cleaner now you just
need a little algebra and the fact
that's summing all these wks will give
you W and putting that all together you
get your first interesting result
congratulations
this is Brent's theorem and what you've
done is very intuitive to interpret to
Brent's theorem says that the time to
execute the dag is no more than the time
to execute the critical path plus the
time to execute everything off of the
critical path using the P processors
this result also sets a goal for any
scheduler so let's say someone is trying
to sell you his or her scheduling
algorithm you can look at him or her and
you can say now wait just a unit of time
there can your scheduler execute any dag
within brentt's time bound you will look
so smart and sophisticated if you do
that let me close by emphasizing one
final point what you just arrived is an
upper bound that is given a dag Brent
predicts the upper limit on time but you
also had these lower bounds now an
interesting factoid is that this upper
limit and this lower limit are both
within a factor of two of one another
can you see why
in any case what this means is that you
may be able to execute the dag in a time
that is less than what Brent predicts
though of course you can never go any
faster than the lower bound at least in
theory let's see how this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
