answer is that the best explanation is a
combination of beta ptosis and Zeta add
by combining these two illnesses we can
cover all of the data we saw over here
we saw both illnesses elevate be which
led to our high be and boasts reduce see
which led to our low see our patient had
a normal level of E but the effects of
beta ptosis and Zeta add counteract
their influence on e then Zeta add
accounts for our reduced F and beta
ptosis accounts for our reduced H my
explanation though heavily weights the
principle of coverage i sacrifice
parsimony by having two different
explanations for the sake of coverage I
now cover all the symptoms I could have
also chose day two desus theta desus
would have explained b c and h it
wouldn't explain f but would be a
simpler explanation than the combination
of beta ptosis and zeta add in that case
i would be sacrificing coverage for
parsimony i could also augment theta
desus with kappa side and new tension
the three of them together would cover
all our symptoms but that would also be
less parsimonious and beta ptosis and
Zeta add alone I may have chosen to do
that though if those three diseases were
much more common than beta ptosis is a
to add in which case I would have more
confidence in them than just these two
there's an excellent answer David but
how did he come up with this on soil so
what I did is I started with the data
and looked at which of these hypotheses
currently match the data the best that
is to say which hypotheses explain the
most points and had the fewest conflicts
so for example beta ptosis explained the
high be low C and the low H but it
didn't explain the low F and also
suggest that there was elevated e
initially theta desus was the best match
it explained three symptoms and just
didn't explain a fourth then based on
that I went looking for another illness
that would complete the explanation for
theta desus that ended up leading media
kappa side and new tension but at that
point I was using three different
hypotheses so I decided to revisit one
of the closer matches from my original
round I revisited beta ptosis which had
two mismatches if predicted elevated E
and didn't explain the reduced F and I
went looking for another hypothesis that
would complete that explanation Zeta add
happened to have exactly those two
effects note that one can use
alternative methods for the same problem
for example one could use case based
reasoning in fact we came across a fall
I'm very similar to this one previously
suppose that the solution of that
particular problem was available as a
case in that particular case B was high
C was low in H was low and the solution
was tetas diseases and the current
problem the additional symptom is that F
is low so case retrieval would first
leave did conclusion of jetan diseases
only to quit this particular solution to
also account for the additional symptom
of F being low we could do that by
adding kappa side and retention to third
eye diseases case based reasoning thus
would tend to focus the alternative set
of hypotheses one more point to note
here then note that different methods
can lead to different solutions given
different methods how might an AI agent
decide which method to select will
return to this particular problem when
we discussed meta reasoning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
