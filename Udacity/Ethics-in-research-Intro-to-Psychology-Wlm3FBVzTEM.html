research methods but one crucial aspect
we did not discuss in detail is ethics
in psychology it's important to know
that before any study is conducted
whether it's with humans or animals it
must be approved by a federally mandated
Committee for humans it's the
institutional review board and for
animals the institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee all committee members
must be trained and certified to serve
let's talk about the IRB for humans two
important questions are asked regarding
any research proposal first is should
the study be done at all here committee
members are going to look at the risks
versus the benefits of participating in
that research if committee members feel
that the benefits outweigh the risks the
second question is asked this is what
constitutes adequate informed consent
here the experimenters have to tell the
participants exactly every step that
they will need to complete throughout
the experiment another important aspect
of ethics and psychology is the right
for the participant to lead the
experiment at any time without negative
consequences finally once a participant
has completed the experiment it's
important to debrief that person meaning
we have to let the person know what the
purpose of the study was and they have
to write to asked any questions
regarding the study some main points to
remember about research ethics are that
we don't want to put anybody in harm's
way
we don't want to deceive anybody
unnecessarily and we must ensure
participants privacy research ethics are
fundamental in the study of psychology
in fact ethics are the most important
part of psychological research</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
