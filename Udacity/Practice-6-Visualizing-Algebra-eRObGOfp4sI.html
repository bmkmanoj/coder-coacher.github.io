together a lot of what we learned in
unit three to start the first problem we
have to know the slope of the given line
and then find the slope of a line that
is parallel to that line so let's find
the slope of the line three X plus y
equals seven in order to find the
equation of a line that's parallel to
this line I first have to find the slope
of this line if I simply subtract 3x
from both sides i get that y equals
negative 3x plus 7 which means the slope
of this given line is negative 3 I know
that parallel line if I want to find the
slope of a line that's parallel to the
given line I know that parallel lines
have the same slope so what I write is M
parallel equals the original slope which
equals negative 3 this is just a
shorthand notation to indicate parallel
so the slope of the parallel line is
equal to the slope of the original line
which is equal to negative 3 to find the
equation of the line I want to label my
points x1 and y1 and I can use the
formula M equals y minus y1 over X minus
x1 since I know my slope is negative 3 i
can write negative 3 over 1 any whole
number can be written as a fraction with
one is the denominator and that's going
to equal y minus y 1 is 4 over x minus
x1 is too when i cross multiply i have
negative 3 times x minus 2 equals 1
times y minus 4 now I need to distribute
so when i distribute i have negative 3
times x negative 3 times negative 2 is
positive 6 equals y minus 4 since i want
the answer in slope intercept form if i
just add 4 to both sides i get negative
3x plus 10 equals y and we know that's
the same as y equals negative 3x plus 10
and one quick check we know that the
slope of the parallel line is the same
as the slope of the original line and
since we put the answer in slope
intercept form I can verify that it has
the same slope now what about the
perpendicular line since we want to find
the equation of the perpendicular line
23 x plus y equals 7 once again i start
with the original slope which is
negative 3 but i want the perpendicular
slope so the perpendicular slope is the
negative reciprocal of the original
slope which is going to be negative 1
over the original slope was negative 3
so a negative times a negative is a
positive so the slope of the
perpendicular line is positive 1 third
now that I know the slope I can use my
equation M Y minus y1 over X minus x1
which gives us one-third equals y minus
y 1 is 4 over X minus X 1 is 2 when i
cross multiply i have 1 times x minus
two equals three times y minus 4 at this
point i need to distribute again when i
multiply x minus 2 times 1 i'm just left
with x minus 2 and i have three times y
+ 3 times negative 4 is negative 12
since I want the equation in
slope-intercept form i need y equals so
I'm going to add 12 to both sides and i
get x plus 10 equals 3y and when i
divide everything through by three i get
y equals x over 3 or one-third x plus 10
over 3 and that's the same as y equals
one-third x plus 10 thirds and again I
can verify my slope is supposed to be
one-third because it's the negative
reciprocal of negative 3 and since we
put it in slope intercept form the slope
is one-third if you got both these
answers right i would say you've learned
a lot about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
