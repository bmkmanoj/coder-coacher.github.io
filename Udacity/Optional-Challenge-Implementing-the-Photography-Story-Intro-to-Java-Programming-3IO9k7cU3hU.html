portfolio working because I kind of want
to see some pictures already it looks
like I need to finish up the ad finished
work method all right now I need to
actually create that finished photo
class so i'll come back to my overview
and make a new class finished photo I'll
move this down here since it's going to
be used by the portfolio now basically I
just want the finished photo to have the
location of the file and the name of the
photographer so i'll create instance
variables for them initialize them in
the constructor and make it possible for
the portfolio to get the information
back out later now I can go back to the
portfolio and compile again and if I
were to actually use the correct class
names I now have the collecting of
finished works working to display them
i'll have to fill in the bits that i
left out before we'll make the picture
based on what saved in my finished work
object translate it to the correct
position and draw it the signature will
have the same x coordinate whoops looks
like I've got a bit of a name collision
here I've called the picture object
photo and I've also called the finished
photo photo so I'm going to call this
one work and they'll need to be careful
to change it in exactly the right places
and now I can actually get the height of
the picture object so that I'll know
where to place the text and I'll get the
actual text for the signature from the
work object not the picture object let's
see how we're doing I should probably
actually call the constructor when I'm
making a text object and now it's better
so let's see how this is working I'll go
back to the overview and create a class
portfolio demo portfolio demo will have
a main method where I'll create a
portfolio object and then add some
finished work to it here's one of the
images I know is in the package and I'm
actually going to use the original
photographers name here and i'll add two
more and at the end i want to display
the work looks like i should capitalize
correctly try this again now if i run my
portfolio demo it prints out the three
photos with the names just as I wanted
looks like I'm ready to start using the
portfolio in the photographer class the
photographer will need to be able to
accept assignments when a photographer
accepts an assignment they'll take a
photo which in this simulation will mean
finding a file name based on a disc
option for the assignment then the
photographer will add the finished work
and their name into the portfolio there
are a few ways that we could get a hold
of the portfolio one is that we could
just have it passed in as a parameter in
this case I'll just put it in as an
instance variable either one works but
I'm going to need to take it in as a
parameter in the constructor and I'm
also going to need the name of the
photographer which will also come in as
a parameter in the constructor now that
should be all set but my photographer is
probably not working all that well yet I
keep using assignments but assignments
haven't been defined yet so I'll make a
new class this is all getting pretty
squished that's a bit better now the
assignment class isn't going to have a
whole lot in it basically the assignment
object is what's going to be stored in
the to-do list for the manager and then
used by the photographer to know what
assignment they should do I know that
I'll need a description for the
photographer and I'll eventually need a
priority it'll come back to that and
here's my getter method for the
description now the photographer should
compile once I fix the typos in the
assignment and now I could write a
photographer demo that shows that the
photographer class works I'll make a new
photographer and give the photographer
portfolio I'll fix a little typo take
out the S that I had here in the
photographer class and then I'll make
sure that all of the assignments made it
into the portfolio by displaying the
finished work when i run the
photographer demo i get 3 photos with me
pretending to have taken them so that's
looking pretty good now i only need to
fix the manager class though the manager
does have some of the more complicated
logic the most interesting part is when
we give out the assignments the manager
will need a list of unfinished
assignments I already defined that
earlier in one of the hint videos along
with a list of photographers now there's
this detail about assigning the
photographer who was hired first the
highest priority assignment so it looks
like I'll be iterating over all of the
photographers and I'm going to want to
look at the one who is hired first first
luckily this won't be too difficult
since I'm storing all of the
photographers in an ArrayList they're
going to be store
in the list in the order that I hired
them so if i iterate over the list I'm
going to iterate over the photographers
starting with the one that was hired
first now for the trickier part I'll
want to find the highest priority
assignment but you already mostly know
how to do this so I'll quickly make a
helper method that does this now there
is one hiccup here I'll need to add the
get priority method to the assignment
class but that wasn't especially
complicated and now I'm back looks like
I tried to index into an ArrayList using
parentheses all right now i'm using the
get method and correcting spelling
errors and i should be able to use my
get highest priority assignment method
so for each photographer I'll get the
highest priority assignment give it to a
photographer and remove it so I don't do
it twice and one more gotcha I only want
to do these things if there's actually
another assignment to be done so if
there are no assignments in the list of
assignments I'll skip all of this I
could add an else return here and then
the moment I realize there are no more
assignments I would stop looking through
the photographer's this isn't necessary
but it might skip a lot of steps if our
company gets really really big and we
have thousands of photographers I think
I'm done with the give out assignments
method now I'll make sure that I've
implemented all the other methods I'll
need to add a photographer to the list
when I hire a photographer and make sure
to initialize all of my array lists as
well as a new portfolio when I get a new
assignment I'll need to add the new
assignment to the list of assignments to
be done and at the end when I'm ready to
check the portfolio I'll use the
portfolio to display the finished work
did it work looks like it if you stuck
with that problem all the way through
and got it great job and if you didn't I
hope that you learned something by
seeing me go through the exercise now
that I have this working I would
probably want to go back and clean up
all of the documentation but I won't
make you spend any more time on this
example kai has some important concepts
to show you with the car share program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
