finding people early on especially those
first couple of key hires which can give
you a lot of anxiety because you feel
like you're betting the whole company on
those first especially the first one but
you know the first two or three and
people will tell you that the first ten
make or break your company and it's
absolutely true for me what I usually
did was find fans of the product in the
community because typically I wasn't
looking for in the early days technical
skills because I was able to do that
work and super enthusiastic users that
loved the product were the best people
to bring in so I know the first person I
told you I had told with operations it
turned out somebody that loved the
product had been an accountant in a
previous life and so I brought him in
and and he sort of took over all that
for me oddly enough my second employer
was was my wife and she was amazing a
little difficult to work with but I did
a great job and but yet for me it was
actually finding users of the product
that had skills so they were already
passionate they were all excited and and
I've seen this model elsewhere 37signals
talks about this too they find people
that already use the product they're
really passionate about it they're
active in the community of helping
people already in forums those are the
best people because they've already
swere self selected based on their
passion for the product in my experience
finding people that are already
passionate about your product he was
just a tight you're gonna have a tiny
audience at that point when it's just
you but that's great that those people
are super passionate they sought you out
and so finding people with the skills
you need in that and that group has
always really worked well for me
throughout my sort of entrepreneurial
career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
