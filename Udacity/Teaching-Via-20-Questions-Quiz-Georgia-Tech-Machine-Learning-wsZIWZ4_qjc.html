questions that we talked about a number
of lectures ago and we're gonna consider
the following analogy that in some sense
what is a what is a learner what does an
inductive learner trying to do its
trying to find the best hypothesis in
some class H and the hypotheses all map
inputs to yes or no let's say that what
we're trying to do in 20 questions is
deal with our hypothesis class H which
is maybe a set of possible people and so
these are the possible answers to the 20
questions problem and X is the set of
questions that you can actually ask so X
they're kind of like training examples
that's how the learner is getting
information about what the right answer
is but no question in and of itself
might actually be sufficiently revealing
of what the hypothesis is all right does
that does that analogy make sense to
Charles makes perfect sense to me all
right good so now let's think about two
different cases one where the teacher is
going to try to select which questions
to ask so the teacher is going to say to
the student here's the question you
should ask me next to try to figure out
which person it is as quickly as
possible and then we'll next we'll look
at what happens if the learner is the
one asking those questions so in some
sense it doesn't seem like it should
make a difference because you know in
either case the learner is going to ask
the question and the teacher is going to
answer truthfully just in one case the
learner has to come up with questions in
the other case the teacher has to come
up with questions so why or why are
these different from each other what
does the teacher have that the learner
doesn't have well the teacher actually
knows the answer indeed all right so
let's let's just do a quick quiz and say
how many questions are necessary for a
smart learner to figure out the right
person assuming that the teacher is the
one who gets to feed the learner good
questions okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
