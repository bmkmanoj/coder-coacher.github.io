non-tree edge can be a bridge they have
to be the green edges not the red edges
and why is that well the red edges are
the ones that get added for a node that
had already been reached by some other
path so the red edges can't be bridge
edges because deleting the the red edge
the node on both sides of this were
reachable from the beginning some other
way next we can test whether or not a
given node is in the subtree rooted at
some node W pretty simply using the
numbers that we've already calculated
the postorder of W the number of
descendants of W and the high and low
values and and why is that so when we go
to do the post ordering at W we go it
down here we number somebody then we
number everybody then we number W itself
the postorder number of everyone in here
has to be less than the post order value
of W but the total number of numbers in
this set they're all the they're all
contiguous they're all in order and the
total numbers of numbers in this set is
blue is a number of descendants so black
minus blue is one smaller than the
smallest number in this collection so
that property is kind of obvious perhaps
but we're almost there the only way that
this edge is not a bridge is if there's
some non-tree edge that takes us out
somehow and connects to something else
in the tree now what would happen to the
H value or the L value if we had one of
these edges remember the H value and the
L value were defined specifically to be
while you follow a bunch of green edges
and then you follow one red edge well if
a red edge takes us to you know sort of
in the left of this tree then the
inorder value is going to be outside of
this range and it'll in particular to be
too small and that'll tell us that we've
linked to something outside to the left
if we link to something outside to the
right then the H number is going to be
bigger than the inorder value at W and
similarly we if we hop up to high that
that same thing happens because the
blobs in here are the nodes in this blob
all have exactly the values in here
anything that connects outside of there
is going to cause the either the H value
or the L value to pop outside of this
range so with those values in the hand
we have a very easy test to see whether
or not there's some red edge that will
actually connect up the graph in a way
that this is no longer a bridge and
that's all we need to do now in the
homework I'm going to ask you to
actually carry out this test on a real
graph actually code it up and it's not
terrible but it is a little bit tricky
you have to be very careful to figure
out how to compute the postorder values
the number of descendants H and L
without taking a lot of running time in
the graph really needs to be able to do
it essentially with one or two sweeps
through the set of all the nodes and the
nodes and edges in the graph but you can
do it
I have confidence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
