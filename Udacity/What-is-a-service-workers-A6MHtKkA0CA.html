amazing performance on slow networks
used to be extremely hard but service
workers change that I've asked Jake
Archibald to explain service workers for
us Jake take it away a service worker is
a JavaScript realm execution context in
an environment settings object with its
own event loop and no document
dependency unlike similar contexts such
as shared workers this context lifecycle
is dictated by life cycle and functional
extendable events and their associated
array of extended life cycle promises
though the user agent may apply a grace
period to avoid startup shutdown
overhead between events ok does that
made no sense let's try this from a
different angle a service worker is a
JavaScript file that is run by your
browser in the background separate from
your web page and handles event fired
either by the browser or your web page
since it's run in the background it
doesn't need the web page to be open and
it doesn't show any markup where it
really signs is the events that it can
listen for one of the most exciting is
the ability to handle fetch events
intercepting and responding to network
requests this puts the serviceworker
virtually between the network and the
browser allowing the serviceworker to
provide content even when offline
because the serviceworker can listen for
event even when the page isn't open they
can respond to push messages sent from
the server to the browser
imagine a chat web client that lets you
know you've got a new unread message
this simply wasn't possible before in
the future service workers will support
other things like periodic sync
geofencing and more in the past you
could have tried using app cast to try
and make an app work offline but it was
a pain there were too many gotchas and
it didn't have the power or flexibility
that serviceworker Springs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
