distribution of the f statistics is not
symmetrical the f distribution is
positively skewed meaning it peaks on
the left side and is stretched out to
the right side this distribution peaks
at one this is because if there are no
differences in the population means in
other words the between group
variability is expected to be 0 then the
mean of each sample will still likely
differ by chance since the difference
then is due to chance the same way that
each subject in each sample differs by
chance as measured by the within group
variability then the between group
variability and within group variability
will be the same therefore when we
divide them we get one and that's where
this distribution peaks also note that
when we're doing an f-test this will
always be non directional whereas when
we were doing the Z and T tests our
alternative hypothesis could have been
that one population mean is less than
another with the f-test we only know if
there's a significant difference our
critical region will always be out here
in the upper tail but everything else is
essentially the same we choose an alpha
level usually point 05 and then we find
out if our F statistic lies in the
critical region or not if it lies in the
critical region we know that at least
two population means will be
significantly different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
