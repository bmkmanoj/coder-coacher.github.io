copying and conflict switches and the
fourth component that adds to the
latency of the RPC transmission is
protocol processing and that's the next
thing that you're going to look at now
the question is what transport should be
used for the RPC and this is where we
want to see how we can take advantage of
what the hardware is giving us if we are
working in a local area network the
local area network is reliable and
therefore our focus should really be on
reducing the latency and not worry so
much about reliability it is often the
case that performance and reliability
are at odds with each other if you focus
on reliability then performance may take
a backseat so here since the RPC
performance is the most critical thing
that we're worried about we're going to
focus on reducing the latency and we're
going to assume that the land is
reliable and therefore let's not worry
about the reliability of message
transmission in a local area network
that's the idea behind the next thing
that we're going to look at let's think
about all the things that can go wrong a
message transmission and see why some of
those things may not be that important
given that we have a reliable local area
network the first thing is you send a
message it might get lost but infinite
local area network the chances that
messages will actually get lost is not
very high it happens in wide area
internet because messages have have to
go out through several different routers
and then maybe queuing in the road is
and there may be loss of packets on the
wire and so on but that's not something
that you have to worry about in a local
area network so the assumption that
messages may not get lost suggests that
there is no need for low level
acknowledgments why because you're
sending a call and the call is going to
be executed and the result is going to
come back and usually a network
transmission we send acknowledgments to
say that yes I received a message now in
this case because the semantics of RPC
says that the act of receiving the RPC
call is going to result in server
procedure execution and the result is
going to come back the result it's
self serves as the act and therefore we
don't need low-level acts to say oh I
received your arguments of the call you
don't have to do that and similarly you
don't have to have a low-level act that
says oh I received the results because
the results were not received the caller
and the client is going to resend the
client call so the high-level semantic
of RPC can itself serve as a way we can
coordinate between the client and the
server and we can eliminate low-level X
and if you eliminate low-level acts that
reduces a latency in the transport a
second thing is in message transmission
on the internet we worry about messages
getting corrupted not maliciously or
anything like that but just due to the
vagaries of the network messages may get
corrupted in going on the wire that
connects the source and destination and
for that reason it's typical to employ
checksum in the messages to indicate the
integrity of the message that checksum
is usually computed in software and
appended to the message and sent on the
wire but in a local area network things
are reliable we don't have to do extra
overhead and software for generating the
checksum just use Hardware checksum if
it is available just use Hardware
checksum for packet integrity don't
worry about adding an extra layer of
software in the protocol processing for
doing software checksum so that's the
second optimization that you can make to
make the protocol processing leaner the
third source of overhead that comes
about and message transmission is once
again related to the fact that messages
may get lost in transmission and
therefore in order to make sure that if
messages are lost in transmission you
usually buffer the packets so that if
the message is lost in transmission you
can read transmit that package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
