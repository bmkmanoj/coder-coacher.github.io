questions well we needed three questions
to be sure that we would find the gold
star by opening one box but we don't
need three questions if we're a little
smarter about our questions we only need
two and the way to do it in two
questions is to ask a question that
gives us more information so the problem
with asking the is it in the green box
question first is that 3/4 of the time
the answer is new and if we're trying to
use yes/no questions or we're trying to
use bits to get as much information as
possible what we want to do is ask
questions where the answer is equally
likely to be yes as it is to be no we
want a question where half the time the
answer is yes and half the time the
answer is no if the question isn't like
that so if it's a question where the
answer is no more often than its yes
well then we could guess the answer is
no and be write more than half the time
so we're not getting a full bit of
information in the result because we had
a good chance for being right without
getting that answer so we want to figure
out questions where the answer is
equally likely to be yes as it is to be
know so we could ask that is our first
question so we an asked is the goal star
and either the green or the purple box
so the answer is yes if it's in one of
those two boxes the answer is no if it's
in either the blue or the red box
so therefore boxes for two of the boxes
the answer is going to be yes so half
the time the answer is yes so that means
we're gaining one full bit of
information if the answer is yes we've
learned that it's in either the green or
the purple box if the answer is no we've
learned that it's in either the blue or
the red box and so if the answer is yes
well now we need to ask one more
question to figure out which box it's in
and that could be is it in the green box
and so if we ask that question if the
answer is yes well then we know it's in
the green box if the answer is no then
we know it's in the purple box we only
needed two questions to get to the right
box and that's the same if the answer
was no to this well then we can ask is
it in the blue box that's a yes/no
question if the answer is yes well then
we know it's in the blue box if the
answer is no then we know that it's in
the red box so now we can cover all four
possible boxes we didn't need three
questions like we did when we asked is
it in the green boxes in the purple box
is it in the blue box we might have
needed three questions to determine the
box here we only need it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
