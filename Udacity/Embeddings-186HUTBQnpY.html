mice it's perfectly reasonable to also
say the kitty purrs or this kitty hunts
mice the context gives you a strong idea
that those words are similar you have to
be cat like to purr and hunt mice so
let's learn to predict the words context
the hope is that a model that's good at
predicting your words context will have
to treat cat and kitty similarly and
will tend to bring them closer together
the beauty of this approach is that you
don't have to worry about what the words
actually mean
you mean further meaning directly by the
company they keep there are many ways to
use this idea that similar words occur
in similar contexts in our case we're
going to use it to map words to small
vectors called embeddings which are
going to be close to each other when
words of similar meanings and far apart
when they don't imbedding solve some of
the sparsity problem once you have
embedded your word into this small
vector now you have a word
representation where all the cat like
things like cats kitties kittens pets
lions are all represented by vectors
that are very similar your model no
longer has to learn new things for every
way there is to talk about a cat's it
can generalize from this particular
pattern of kite like things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
