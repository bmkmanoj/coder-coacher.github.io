2 ooh that was a lot of concepts piece
by piece you're learning about all the
components involved in retrieving data
from the internet and displaying it in a
nap yeah we covered how to create and
configure an HTTP request as well as how
to send the request using the HTTP URL
connection class then we learned how to
receive and parse the response remember
that the response comes as a stream of
data and we used a bufferedreader to
convert the input stream into a string
while learning about the stringbuilder
class totally there are a lot of tough
concepts in this lesson so be proud of
yourself for persisting through it hey
Chris what's the best way to really
learn something what's that it's to
teach somebody else yeah great idea so
why do you find a friend or a family
member and explain what you learned in
this lesson you can use a networking
diagram to help you teach the concepts
then let us know how the conversation
went by sharing your experience in the
discussion forum good luck you're going
to do great awesome work finishing up
this lesson now it's always good to
reflect a little bit about the things
that you've learned so I want you to go
ahead and explain what you've learned
about networking this lesson to a friend
or a family member and feel free to use
the diagrams link below if they're
helpful more than anything it'd be great
if you could share your experience in
the discussion forum so feel free to do
that and check this box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
