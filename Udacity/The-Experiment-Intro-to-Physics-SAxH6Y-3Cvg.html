Roberta and apparently most of Syracuse
as well we are going to do the
experiment we've been learning about
Eratosthenes experiment where he
determines the circumference of the
earth
measuring shadows so all you're going to
need to do to perform this experiment is
get some help
thank you about that you're going to
need a string or some sort of straight
stick a weight on the end of that string
to make sure that it's truly vertical
and some sort of measuring device now my
measuring device is a ruler and it's
marked in inches you might have one mark
in centimeters but like we mentioned
before the only thing relevant in this
experiment is the ratio and the units
don't matter so it's really not
important now let's go ahead and make
our first measurement
can you just put it perfect and down so
your thumb touches perfect perfect and
the length here is 42 inches now without
without changing anything without moving
anything Roberta is holding perfectly
still
okay that's CA I'm gonna make the next
measurement which is that at the shadow
and I get a result of eight and a half
inches now you'll notice over here it's
not really clear where the shadow begins
and ends
this is uncertainty in my measurement
and that's something we're gonna have to
deal with when you do the experiment at
home you will have uncertainty as well
in fact uncertainty is inherent to any
measurement you make in physics we'll
talk about that later but thank you very
much Roberta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
