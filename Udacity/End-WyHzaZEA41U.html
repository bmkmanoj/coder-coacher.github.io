was really cool was this holistic notion
of the human motion we also didn't have
a large database you have a small number
of examples so it's not sort of the
large discriminative database learning
kind of stuff that goes on in action
recognition now what we're going to do
next time is we take a look at different
approach that take some look at looks at
video as a time series time series
analysis and just some basic approach to
doing that and again this will be
something where much like the svms that
we just talked about we said it can only
give you a small taste of it and if you
want to know more about it you should
take course in machine learning we're
going to show you a very simple notion
of a form of a graphical model approach
to doing action recognition and if you
want to do more of that again you'll
take machine learning but that's what
we're going to do next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
