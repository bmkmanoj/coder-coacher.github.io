behavior easy because forwarding
decisions are based on matches on the
open flow 10 tubule layer 2 switching is
simply a match on the destination MAC
address which has a corresponding action
of forwarding out a particular output
port if all of the fields are specified
for forwarding out a particular output
port then we have flow switching
behavior if all of the flow
specifications are wild carded except
for say the source MAC address to make a
forwarding or drop decision then we have
a firewall constructing a firewall is as
simple as building a hash table that
stores key value pairs where the table
Maps a switch and source MAC address to
a true or false value depending on
whether traffic should be forwarded or
dropped the controller might then only
decide to forward traffic if the
firewall entry maps to true it is
important to emphasize the performance
implications of caching the decisions at
the switch so packets only reach the
controller if there's no flow table
entry at the switch if on the other hand
there is a flow table entry at the
switch then the switch can simply
forward the packets rather than sending
them to the controller so when a
controller decides to take an action on
a packet it installs that action as a
flow table entry in the switch and that
decision or flow table entry is cached
until that flow table entry expires in
summary customizing control is easy
we've explored how to use the pox
controller to develop alternate control
programs and it's possible to turn a
switch into a firewall in less than 40
lines of Python code we also explored
the performance benefits of caching
rules and decisions to avoid sending too
much traffic to the controller as we
know a forwarding performance in the
switches is fast but whenever we have to
send traffic to the controller it slows
things down so whatever decisions we can
- and the switch will only serve to
improve the performance of the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
