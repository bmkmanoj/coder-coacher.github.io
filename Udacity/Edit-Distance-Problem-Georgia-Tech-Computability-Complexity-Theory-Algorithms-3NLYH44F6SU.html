problem of sequence alignment or at a
distance this often comes up in the
study of genetics or as part of spell
checkers for example suppose that we're
given two genetic sequences and we want
to line them up as best as possible
minimizing the needed insertions
deletions and changes to the characters
that would be needed to convert one to
the other and we'll do this according to
some cost function that represents how
likely these changes are to have
occurred in nature another way to think
about this is to say that I have aligned
these elements of the sequence here and
left some of the elements unmatched in
general we say that we're given two
sequences x and y over some alphabet and
we want to find an alignment between
them that is a subset of the pairs of
elements of the sequence so that each
letter appears only once in this
alignment and the pair's don't cross
like in this example here the cost of an
alignment comes from two sources one is
the number of unmatched characters which
we can write mathematically as n plus M
minus twice the size of the alignment
this corresponds to the number of
insertions or deletions or matching with
these dashed characters in this figure
the other part of the cost comes from
the matching of the two characters and
we'll notate that cost with this
function alpha typically alpha is zero
when the two characters are the same and
the problem here of course is to find
the alignment that minimizes this cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
