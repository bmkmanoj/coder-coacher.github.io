with strings the next one I'm going to
talk about is selecting sub sequences
from strings so what we've seen so far
we've used indexing where we have a
string we have our square bracket we
have some expression that produces one
number and we have our closed square
bracket and that gives us a one
character string at whatever position
the number refers to in the string here
the other thing we can do with square
brackets is select a subsequence of the
string instead of just having one
expression here what we can have is an
expression this is also something that
should evaluate to a number followed by
a colon followed by another expression
both of these expressions are numbers
and this will evaluate to a string
that's a subsequence of the characters
in the input string but we'll call the
string s the value of this number we'll
call start and the value of this number
we'll call stop and what the result is
is a string that's a subsequence of all
the characters in s in the string that
we had here starting from position start
to the number to the left of the colon
and ending with position stop but not
including that character so it's going
to really include the characters from
position start up through stop minus 1
so this construct allows us to select
from any string a subsequence of
continuous characters in that string so
let's try an example in the Python
interpreter I'm going to initialize the
variable word to be the string assumed
and using the single index operator we
saw initially we can select a character
from word so if I select word index 3
that will give us the 4th character 0 1
2 3 which is you and when we run that we
see the result is you with the new
operation that's the same as selecting
word 3 colon 4 that's going to select
starting from position 3 going to just
before position 4 so that will end up
being just the one letter you just to
make this clear if I selected 3 colon 3
there's no
there that's just a single empty string
which prints out in a way we can't see
it there's no characters between three
and character three we'll go back to
just selecting index three I could
select from position four through
position six that will give us a string
which is the subjects of letters at
position 4 and position 5 so when we run
this now we see the first one prints out
to you the second one prints out me
which is position 4 and position 5 the
last two characters in the word I'll
show you one other thing we can do which
is leave one of the sides of the colon
empty so if we did 4 colon to the end
that will select from position 4 to the
end we don't need to actually count the
characters to know where the end is so
that will produce the same thing as we
did before
we can also leave nothing in front of
the colon that will select from the
beginning so if we do colon to that
we'll select from position 0 up to
position 2 giving us the first two
letters in the word as and we could
leave both sides blank selecting word
square bracket colon square bracket with
nothing on either side well starts from
the beginning goes to the end that's
going to give us the whole word there's
no good reason to ever want to do this
but it's consistent with the syntax
where we can leave one side of the colon
empty and that means selecting from
either the beginning or the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
