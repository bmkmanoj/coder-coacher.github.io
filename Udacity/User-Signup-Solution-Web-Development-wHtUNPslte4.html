well as a sign up page here's my sign up
page and the idea was you could type in
a username and a password and an
optional email if you want and then
click Submit and it will take you to a
welcome page now if you type in if you
leave your passwords blank you get an
error message if you don't enter both
passwords in it complains that they
didn't match if you give an invalid name
which in my case was I made it be a
minimum of three characters it complains
that it's not a valid name and an email
is optional but if I type in something
that's not a valid email it complains so
if I type in an email and I type in some
valid stuff and hit submit we get to the
Welcome page okay let's look at the code
for this real quick ah one last thing I
did I should show you a check to make
sure the username is valid here too so
if you put in an invalid name in the URL
it'll automatically redirect you to the
signup page
okay let's take a peek at the code here
is the portion of the code where we are
doing this the signup handler you can
see my urls down here i've got unit to
sign up goes to the class sign up and
unit to welcome goes to the class
welcome and the signup page if you just
get it it renders the empty signup form
which is another template that i'm using
i'll show you here this is just HTML now
again you could have used a big string
most of you probably did here's my HTML
you can see it's got a form method post'
i use the table to lay out the form you
don't have to do that we didn't grade on
the appearance of it I just use the
table to make my columns line up nice
I'm the important part was we've got an
input type text' name is username and
the value this is another template
variable and then the error
here's another template variable you
know this could just as easily easily be
percent s in the way in the way that you
learned how to do it we've got an input
type password name password values blank
the value is blank here because whenever
there's an error I don't put the
passwords back in the form field if
there's an error with the passwords or
if there's an error with anything we
make them retype the password the
password error field the verify input
type password name verify that's for the
verifying the password and an error for
that one and then we've got our email
email optional
type text' name email value email if
there's an error with that we'll leave
it in there so they can update it and
then the error message for that field
and input type equals submit and let's
take a peek at the code for this guy
when you post it here what I did is I I
have a variable called have error and
this basically if we make it through
this whole function and this is still
false then we render the success page
otherwise we render the error page so
first I get two parameters I get the
username password verify email out of
the out of the requests requests that
get fetches those parameters then what I
do is I run it through these functions
that I've written valid username valid
password and valid email I've defined
regular expressions I believe we gave
these to you for each of these so a
username it's just a through Z zero
through nine you know basically SB
between three and twenty characters we
provided this to you and I think we
showed you how to use regular
expressions as well so this function is
very simple if there is a username
basically if it's not blank and it
matches this regular expression true
password is similar thing basically any
characters between length three and
twenty if there's a password and it
matches this regular expression return
true and the email the actual email
regular expression the to validate and
email is comically long it's thousands
of characters I use a simpler version
which is basically a bunch of characters
and at sign a bunch of characters a
period and then a bunch of characters I
find that works pretty well
you try to get more complicated than
that there's a good chance you'll reject
what would otherwise be a valid email so
I usually let you know if we're going to
send emails to people I let whatever
tool I'm using to send the email you
know that can break if the email is not
valid this this gets us close enough I
might in fact I think read it uses this
regular expression still and it's always
worked fine I think there's some limits
to the length of this but one more thing
I make this dictionary called params and
these are params I'm going to send back
in to to rendering this would be similar
to when you're if you're using the
string substitution to draw your HTML if
it's going to build up this dictionary
of the variables that you want to
substitute in so I'm always going to
send back the username and email if it's
a bad bad form if the username wasn't
valid I add the error username through
this params dictionary and I set have R
equals true
if the password isn't valid here's the
password error have error equals true if
the passwords valid and it doesn't equal
the verify variable from the request we
say the passwords don't match that have
variables true and then email a valid
email if you look is different from the
other ones these ones say return
password and this one says return not
email or so this is saying is either
they don't specify an email or it has to
match this regular expression everybody
else says they have to give a password
and it has to match the regular
expression that's how we handle the
emails optional case and then basically
if we have an error I just render the
signup form again with our error
messages and if we don't have an error I
redirect to this URL in putting in
username into the URL as a get parameter
when we handle Unit two slash welcome we
come to this handler here welcome and we
get the user name out of the request
using request get and then if it's a
valid username render the Welcome HTML
template user name equals user name or
redirect back to the signup page and the
Welcome HTML template is pretty short
all it is is just basic HTML and it says
welcome and then includes the username
and that's that so that was homework 2 I
hope you managed to figure everything
out I hope you know after seeing my
solution with the templates and your
solution with the string substitutions
are eager to start using these templates
on your own I'm not going to talk about
them I'm not going to teach you how to
use them specifically but there's plenty
of documentation on the Google App
Engine site and I'm sure in the forum's
they'll be lots of activity as well and
also we can provide this these few lines
here and this base class if you all will
find that helpful
ok good job everybody and on to unit 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
