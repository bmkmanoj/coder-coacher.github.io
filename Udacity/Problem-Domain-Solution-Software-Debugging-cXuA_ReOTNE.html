studies of Firefox and Eclipse we found
one specific feature of the code that
dominated all others and these were the
imports made by individual modules that
is the other modules that the module in
question would interact with more
specifically whatever a module imported
would determine its likelihood to have a
defect in Firefox for instance if your
module included NS I private Dom event
dot H and NS readable you tolls dot H
that is use these specific api's or
interacted with a specific eight the
eyes the new code would be doomed
because the 20 modules that also
included these two files all had at
least one security issue
likewise in Eclipse if you imported
something that dealt with internal
features of the compiler your code would
be four to five times as error-prone as
code that only dealt with a graphical
user interface why is that so well if
you write import compiler internal this
means you're going to write some
compiler code and compiler code is more
error prone than user interface code in
particular because if you work with the
user interface most errors you make will
be immediately visible to the human eye
whereas if you deal with compiler
internals it's a long path from from a
bug in the compiler to a bug in the
actual compiled program which then again
has to be executed in order to have the
bug caused a failure and none of this
needs to be discovered right away and
all of these are reasons why this domain
namely the compiler is way more
error-prone than the user interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
