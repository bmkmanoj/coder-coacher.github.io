function we know how to deal with cost
now it's time to put it all together and
it's a little bit tricky so I'm not
going to ask you to do this as a quiz if
you want to you can pause the video now
and do it on your own you're certainly
welcome to give it a try but I'm going
to go ahead and show it to you okay here
it is so the tricky part is just keeping
track of the costs and putting them in
in the right location just like before
we're popping off pass off the frontier
we're checking to see if we've hit a
goal we've keeping track of states that
we've already explored but now we're
doing something new we're computing the
cost of the path that we just popped off
and that's just pulling the cost out
because we've already computed it and
stored it in the final action and then
for each of the successors we figure out
the total cost is the cost of the path
that we already computed so far plus the
bridge cost of the individual action so
total cost so far plus costs for one
more action and then we just throw that
into the path so the new path is equal
to the old paths plus the action total
cost to pull plus the state that we end
up with add that to the frontier and
we're done and I just define this simple
one-line function here the final state
of a path is the last element of the
path and use that there and here's
adding to the frontier now it could just
be throwing it on there the way we did
before but there's a tricky part here
and the complication that I want to deal
with here that we haven't dealt with
before was there may be two different
paths then end up in the same state and
if that's the case we want to choose the
best one you don't want to get to this
date from a path that's more expensive
so we look and see is there a path that
gets to the state that is already on the
frontier if there is then check to see
which one has a better path cost and use
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
