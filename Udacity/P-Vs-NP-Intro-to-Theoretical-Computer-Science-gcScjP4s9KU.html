we're going to be talking about some
distinctions between P and NP and also
what it would mean if P were equal to NP
or if instead P were not equal to NP
let's look at a few examples so first it
might be the case that if P were equal
to NP then that would mean that every
single computational problem could be
solved in polynomial time and it could
also be the case that if P were not
equal to NP and we could prove that then
that would mean that there are no
np-complete problems that could be
solved in polynomial time we might also
say that regardless of whether P equals
NP or P does not equal NP that there are
still np-complete problems that are
easier in some sense to solve in
practice than others we might also say
that well if we have the ability to
solve some instances of an np-complete
problem then that necessarily implies
that P equals NP we could also say that
showing a problem is np-complete
automatically means that we know it
can't be solved in polynomial time so
which of these statements do you think
are actually true please check all that
you think are true statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
