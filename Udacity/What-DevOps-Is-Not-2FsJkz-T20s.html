DevOps going around so I'd like to clear
up a few things about how we're going to
be talking about it in this context
first off doing DevOps doesn't mean that
Ops is going away or that devs are
taking over ops responsibilities dev and
ops both have experiences and knowledge
to contribute
neither roles being eliminated another
thing DevOps isn't is just a bunch of
tools in this course you'll learn about
several tools for doing things like
deployment and monitoring but using
these tools is not the same thing as
doing DevOps here's an analogy Google
Calendar is a great tool for helping you
get to meetings on time but putting your
meetings on a calendar doesn't make you
show up on time and it doesn't cause you
to want to show up on time either if
you're like me you want to show up to
meetings on time because you respect
your co-workers and you want to get
things done with them and if you had a
meeting conflict or show up late because
you forgot about a meeting you'd feel
like you'd failed to meet up to that but
using the calendar program is then a
tool to help you accomplish a goal you
already had so DevOps is kind of like
showing up to meetings on time it's not
a matter of using particular tools even
though tools can help you do it it's an
organizational change that's supported
by those tools but at the same time it
would be basically impossible to
organize large meetings without some
sort of calendar and likewise it's not
practical to scale software deployment
without some tools to do that the tools
that you learn about in this course
provides support for making big changes
in how you manage software systems and
although in this course you'll be
working by yourself
rather than in an actual large
organization I hope that you'll get a
sense of how to apply these ideas and
tools in your own organization on your
own projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
