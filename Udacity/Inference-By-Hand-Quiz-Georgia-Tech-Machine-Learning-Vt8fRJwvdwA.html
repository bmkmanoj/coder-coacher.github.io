rules into play by actually doing some
inference by hand ultimately we're going
to derive some algorithms that can do
this so you don't have to think about it
so hard but understanding those
algorithms it's helpful to have gone
through an exercise where we actually
use these ideas so so here's a set up
let's imagine that we've got two boxes
one has four balls in it and one has
five balls in it and we're gonna choose
one of those boxes uniformly at random
either either the box that we choose is
equal to box one or the box that we
choose is equal to box two and after
that we're gonna draw at random
uniformly at random from what's inside
the box one of the balls and let's say
it turns out to be green all right so
the first draw that we make we have a
green ball we reach into that same box a
second time and when the question is
what's the probability that that second
ball will be blue given that the first
one we drew was green so let's to make
baby to help point out how this is
connected with Bayes net inference
Charles why don't you help me draw the
Bayes net that corresponds to this
problem okay so if I think about it as a
process which now means I'm thinking
about this as things causing the other
the first thing that you did in the
process is you picked the box good all
right so let's say so their first
variable in the net is going to be the
box variable right and then once I had
the box variable what their I can now
pick the second thing in the process is
I pick a ball so in this case you're
calling it one so I make the first pick
and is it we need an arrow there yeah
because the you picked the box and then
that lets you pick which ball that you
have so which ball you pick the color of
the ball you pick depends upon the box
so to speak
good and so the probabilities here are
gonna be it's gonna look like this
alright so the second variable here is
what what color ball you get when you do
the first draw from the box and we can
represent this as a conditional
probability table so for box one it's
three quarters green one quarter yellow
or orange zero blue and for box two it's
two fifths zero three fifths and so that
captures what happens on the first draw
so for the second draw well clearly that
sort of depends upon what you do the
first time because you said we were
drawing without replacement
so it definitely depends upon what you
what you drew the first time but also it
still depends upon the box okay so now
we've got tables for a box we've got
tables for ball one and we need to know
what ball two's going to be well the
value that ball two takes definitely
depends upon whatever value ball one
takes but but it also depends upon which
box you're in so you need an arrow from
there as well and what would be really
nice is if we were in the storm
lightning and thunder case where if I
knew that it was what ball one was I
would know what ball to us but that's
not true because in a case for example
when ball one is green it doesn't tell
me what ball two is unless I also know
which box I'm in so we have to draw the
hero from box to the ball - indeed right
and so there's a lot of lot of
probabilities that we have to write down
but let's let's just write down a piece
of that table let's say that the value
of ball two depends on which box and it
depends on what ball one is but let's
just look at the piece of that table
where the ball one is green mm-hmm
because that's what we're altima we're
going to need here
so now ball two in the case we were
drawing from box one there probably
that's green in the case where the first
ball had been green it leaves just two
out of three right and one out of three
yellow and no blue but on the other hand
had we drawn from box two first and
again had we had gotten green now it's
green 1/4 zero yellow and blue three
quarters right and there's yeah we need
the same thing for the other case where
ball one is yellow and ball one is blue
but we're not going to need those
numbers for this problem right all right
so is so now that we've written it as a
Bayes net has that does that helpful at
all so weird we haven't asked a question
yet so maybe it's time to ask the
question and then we can work on the
answer okay all right the question is
what's the probability that the second
draw is blue given that the first draw
had been green go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
