the results of the geocoding web service
let's switch back to the JavaScript API
and incorporate it into our app will use
the geocoding service client side since
we'll need user input the user searching
for a new home may want to indicate a
location to base their search around one
way to do that would be to have them
enter a point of interest a neighborhood
or an address after they do that we can
Center our map and zoom it around that
location instead of showing the entire
city so we'll define another user input
here in our HTML I'm calling this zoom
to area text because I'll prompt the
user to focus on an area of the city
this would be useful if we had a ton of
listings we'll also add a zoom button
and a horizontal rule to keep our page a
little meter I'm also adding some more
CSS next we'll create an event listener
in our initialize function so that when
the zoom to area button is clicked we
call our zoom to area function which
will create below the goal of this zoom
to area function is to take the user
entered address geocode it to get the
lat long and then Center the map on that
lot long and zoom in the first thing
we'll do is create a new geo coder
instance will then capture the user
entered address and make sure it isn't
blank finally we'll geocode that address
we're also adding in a component
restriction here to keep it within the
city so that they don't enter an address
outside of New York City after we get
the results we'll check our geo coder
status to make sure it's okay and then
we'll use the resulting lat law we got
back to recenter the map and zoom it if
the results were not okay we'll give the
user message that we couldn't find the
location they entered we could also show
some more information here such as the
actual status code received so if adjei
looks for a jail and we could let him
know we didn't find it as opposed to
letting him know that we got a server
error or something all right let's give
this a go I'm going to zoom in on the
East Village boom now the user can zoom
in on the Upper East Side Soho these
village any area that they're interested
in looking at houses within so it's
getting easier and easier for the user
to see exactly what listing they're
interested in let's practice what we've
learned about geocoding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
