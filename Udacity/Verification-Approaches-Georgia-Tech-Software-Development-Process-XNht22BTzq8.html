initial set of basic definitions let's
go back to our main concept which is
software verification we said that
software is buggy and because software
is buggy we need to verify the software
as much as we can but how can we verify
software there are several ways to
verify a software system among those we
will discuss four main stream approaches
the first one is testing also called
dynamic verification the second approach
is static verification the third
approach is inspections and finally
we're going to consider a fourth
approach which is formal proofs of
correctness so what I'm going to do next
I'm going to first provide an overview
of these approaches and then discuss
some of them in more depth and please
note that although we will discuss all
four approaches we will spend most of
our time on software testing as software
testing is the most popular and most use
the approach in industry so let's start
with our overview and in particular with
testing testing a software system means
exercising the system to try to make it
fail more precisely let's consider a
program it's simple domain which is the
set of all the possible inputs for the
program and its output domain which is a
set of all the possible corresponding
outputs given this context we can define
what a test case is a test case is a
pair that consists of a an input from
the input domain D and then expected
output o from the output domain and O is
the element in the output domain that a
correct software would produce when run
against AI we can also define the
concept of test suite which is a set of
test cases and we're going to use these
two concepts of test case and test fit
quite a bit in the rest of the lessons
static verification tries to identify
specific classes of problems in the
program such as note pointer
dereferences and unlike testing what it
does is that it does not just consider
individual inputs it instead considers
all possible inputs for the program so
it consider in a sense all possible
executions of the program and all
possible behaviors of the program that's
why we say the verification unlike
testing is complete the third technique
we are going to consider is inspections
and inspections are also called reviews
or walkthroughs and unlike the previous
day
NIC's inspections are a human intensive
activity more precisely they are a
manual and group activity in which
several people from the organization
that developed the software look at the
code or other artifacts developed during
the software production and try to
identify defects in this artifact and
interestingly inspections have been
shown to be quite effective in practice
and that's the reason why they're used
quite widely in industry finally the
last technique I want to mention is
formal proof of correctness given a
software specification and actually a
formal specification so a document that
formally defines and specifies the
behavior the expected behavior of the
program a formal proof of correctness
proves that the program being verified
actually implements the program
specification and it does that through
sophisticated mathematical analysis of
the specifications and an object code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
