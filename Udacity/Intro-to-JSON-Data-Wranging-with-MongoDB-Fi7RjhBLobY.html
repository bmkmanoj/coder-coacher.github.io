can represent in tabular data in many
situations we have data items with
fields that have subfields as
programmers were accustomed to this way
of thinking we have objects that have
fields that reference other objects and
a lot of times all the objects have
several fields of their own so here
we're looking at the Beatles discography
page on Wikipedia this is the page we
use to produce that data that we looked
at earlier okay so if we were to
represent this data in a tabular form in
a CSV file or Excel worksheet we need to
do some unwinding given that we've got
certifying authorities here and
different types of certifications gold
record platinum record and so on there's
also this additional complicating factor
that an individual record can be
certified as some multiple platinum so
this particular album is a
multi-platinum record four times
platinum platinum means it sold a
million copies four times platinum means
it sold more than four million copies so
if we wanted to represent this part of
this data set in a tabular form we would
essentially need two columns for every
certifying authority one for what level
of certification and one for the
multiplier aside from being tedious and
error-prone this is just a really
unnatural way to represent this data so
this is why the JSON standard has
emerged for modeling data and as a means
of transmitting data between systems so
let's take a look at a way of
representing this data in JSON I'm just
going to look at a hard day's night hard
day's night is interesting because it
was actually released on two different
labels on two different dates so let's
take a look then at how we might do this
in JSON alright so what I've done is
I've taken just the hard day's night
data and implemented it as a JSON object
okay so you can see that we have a field
for title artists and releases and as we
scroll down through this data you can
see that releases is actually an array
okay in this case I've got two because
if you remember we have two different
releases for this one on the United
Artists label and one on the Parlophone
label okay what we've done here as well
because the chart positions are in
reference to a specific release
we need to make them part of the
appropriate release object within the
releases array so in this case the peak
chart position for the United Artists
release of a hard day's night in France
was 5 in the UK was 1 we also need to
associate the certifications with the
release because a different release will
have different certifications so here
we've got the different certifying
authorities and then for that RIAA
certification it has the multiplier for
because it was actually a four times
platinum album okay and here is the
release data for the other release the
one on Parlophone so this is a way of
representing the data in JSON and it's
important to note that JSON objects are
just like dictionaries in Python and
many other languages there is a datatype
in most programming languages that's
analogous to a JSON object and Python it
happens to be a dictionary many other
languages have dictionary or map like
data types that are very similar to JSON
object and most programming languages
have arrays as well in Python they
happen to be called lists okay so let's
just document some of what we have to
remember about JSON here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
