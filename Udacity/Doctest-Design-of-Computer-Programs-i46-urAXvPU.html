I'm really going to need some tests to
make sure I got this right and rather
than write the types of tests that we
had before with the search statements
I'm going to induced a new type of tests
and this comes from the standard Python
module called doc test it stands for
documentation test and the idea is that
you can write comments the sort of
comments that go with your class items
and with your function items and then
automatically have them run its tests
and the tests look just like something
that you would type in to the Python
interpreter so the way doc test knows
that you've got a test is you have the
three arrow prompt and then an
expression as input and then the
following lines are the output that
comes back from that expression and a
test to see if what comes back when you
run the test is what was expected so
here I've typed in what I've done at a
an interactive session what the results
should be and then when I make a change
to my program i can run it again and
make sure i haven't messed anything up
for example at the start here i just
want to test out what are the successors
of the start state with both glasses are
empty and when one glass has capacity
for and the other has capacity nine in
general that are there are six actions
but here a lot of them end up being the
same because if you pour zero in 20
either way or if you empty out either of
them it all comes out the same and so we
only end up with three states and they
happen to be have these labels 09
filling why 00 we call that emptying why
but chorus tempting 0 gives you 0 so it
could have been the no op but that's
just the way the successor function
works out and then 40 is filling X more
interestingly if you have three and five
and you fill so this is testing when we
aren't exceeding the capacity and this
test is when we do exceed the capacity
we can see they work out to the right
numbers and then we solve a problem come
up with a solution
and so on so doc test is a nice capacity
to allow you to write tests this way and
you can sprinkle them throughout your
program and then you can run the tests
just say print doc test test mod which
stands for test module and if you give
it no arguments it tests the current
module and when i run this I i get the
comforting message that there's a test
result that is none of the tests failed
and there were nine that we're
attempting so let's go back and look at
this solution so I'm asking given
glasses of levels 49 trying to find the
goal of six and this is the shortest
solution possible Phil why poor from y
into X empty X do the same empty X again
Phil y into X again Phil why and poor
from my decks and then we end up with a
six in Y and we can solve problems more
generally so here I've defined a
function num actions which says given an
X&amp;amp;Y capacity and a goal how long does it
take to solve the goal the total number
of steps it's going to take and then I
asked here for all values of X&amp;amp;Y less
less than 10 for all capacities less
than 10 and for all goals smaller than
the capacity what's the longest what's
the hardest which combination of those
takes the most actions and the answer
was if you're given glasses of size 7
and 9 and asked to pour out eight that's
the hardest problem within that range</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
