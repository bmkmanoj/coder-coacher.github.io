leafy greens like kale or spinach I
think this dose of warfarin will be just
right for you thanks doc no problem
knowing your genotype for the vkorc1 or
sip to see nine alleles could be really
important information to share with your
doctors hope he or she can prescribe the
right dose of warfarin that maximizes
the efficacy and minimizes the toxicity
now even if you don't know this genetic
information beforehand there are ways of
measuring your reaction to a particular
dose of a drug like warfarin after
you've started treatment but wouldn't it
be nice to know this genetic information
in advance so let's see if you can put
all this knowledge together that we've
learned about in this lesson and come up
with the right prescription you can
prove to me that you understand what the
right prescription would be if you can
tell me what combination of the
following possibilities could result in
maximum warfarin toxicity remember that
warfarin toxicity means too much
warfarin to help you out I put down here
the pathway warfarin blocks blood
clotting if it blocks blood clotting too
much it actually causes bleeding or
hemorrhaging its mechanism of action is
by blocking vkorc1 which promotes
vitamin K recycling which leads to blood
clotting and sip 2c9 metabolizes
warfarin so it effectively inhibits the
activity of warfarin for each of these
three possible categories here I want
you to tell me which total combination
of these three things would result in
maximum warfarin toxicity and once you
do that I want you to describe for me
why you think that is why the particular
combination you've selected you think is
the right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
