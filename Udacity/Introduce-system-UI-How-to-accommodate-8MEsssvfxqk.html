of Android wear when we talk about
system UI elements we talk about cards
and indicators that give the user of the
status of the wearable and show
notifications from services on the
user's phone your job as a designer is
to keep these elements from obscuring
your design by placing them carefully
cards here are the notification system
that bridges information between the
wearable and a mobile device cards are
also how most applications communicate
with users the user will be notified on
the wearable about items such as emails
and messages we also have this concept
of something called a peek card the p
card is the top card in the stream
that's partially visible over the bottom
of the watch face the API provides the
ability to detect the dimensions of the
peak card like this red square here so
that your design can react to this if
necessary you have the ability to
request that Pete cards by default or
hidden small or variable to expand of
the contents the user also has the
ability to force show or hide a pcard as
well but you need to design for all
possibilities if you have a watch face
with the time shown right at the top you
can allow a variable Pete card that
expands to the full height this gives
the most notification information to the
user when needed if on the other hand
you have the time at a relatively low
position you should leverage a small
Pete card instead if you have a round
face with analog hands you probably
should choose a small peek card as well
however the system notifies your watch
face when the bounds of a pcard change
like here so that you can rearrange the
elements of your design if necessary
like in this example here where the
clock face is actually resized itself
indicators tell the user the status of
the wearable such as charging airplane
mode connectivity and so forth and the
hot word is the phrase ok Google which
tells the user that they can interact
with the watch using voice commands when
user activates the wearable the hot word
can appear on the screen for a few
seconds the indicator and the hot word
can be placed in several fixed locations
on the wearable if you have a large Pete
card they should go at the top of the
screen when you position these at the
bottom the system forces a small Pete
card if the edge of the watch face
contains strong visual elements such as
ticks or numbers like this one here then
you should place the indicators at the
center of the screen finally the
indicators and hot word are drawn in the
text with no
background so if you have a watch face
with complex details in the background
like text you'll need to draw a filled
background like these behind the text in
an appropriate color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
