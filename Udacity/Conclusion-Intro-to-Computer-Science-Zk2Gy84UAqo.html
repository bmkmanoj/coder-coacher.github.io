end of this unit and made it to the end
of the course and you now have a search
engine running as a web application and
a way to separate the crawling part from
the server there's certainly a lot you
can do to improve that but let's recap
what we've learned this unit you learned
about how to set up a web application
using web Pi and that led us to the more
broadly applicable idea of regular
expressions and then we looked at how to
use files and to deal with files well we
needed to understand exceptions and you
use try and accept and finally to do
that as well as the width construct the
other thing we've seen a lot in this
unit is examples of using inheritance
this was the main topic of the previous
unit I'd encourage you to think about
all the place that we've used
inheritance in this unit to make things
work well especially the inheritance
hierarchy for exceptions I want to thank
you for taking the class and all the
effort that you've put in to get to this
point you've really learned a lot
I don't think Google is scared of you
yet but you're well on your way to
becoming a computer scientist as well as
to becoming a proficient Python ista
there's lots of things you can do from
here and there'll be more discussion
about this in the forums you definitely
know enough to make your own interesting
programs and unleash them on the world
and I hope many of you will do that if
you do I hope you'll share it with us
and there's a site for sharing you
daesh's projects some of the examples
there might give you some inspiration
about things you might build there is of
course a lot more to learn and if you
learn more you'll be able to do more
interesting things in better ways and I
learn new things about computing every
day I hope you'll continue to learn more
after this class and I hope you'll go on
to do exciting and interesting things
stay you dishes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
