need to install two devices one up here
and one down here this one up here
covers those three cables and this one
down here covers these three here so
this one is covered twice but we need at
least two devices to cover the whole
network and actually in this case this
is the only possible solution for this
but of course a computer can't just see
that two devices suffice so Alice's
algorithm trying all possibilities would
have to go through all of the
possibilities that you could have of
installing a device at a certain
communication point or not installing
one so in this case here that would
actually be 16 different possibilities
if we give the communication points
little letters here so that we can
better distinguish them so Alice's
algorithm trying all possibilities would
have to consider installing no device at
all which would of course not be a valid
solution it could try stalling just a
device at a which again would not be a
valid solution and so on and of course
the algorithm would also find solutions
that are valid but would use more than
the minimum number of monitoring devices
that are actually needed but since the
algorithm tries all possibilities it
will also find this solution here using
just two devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
