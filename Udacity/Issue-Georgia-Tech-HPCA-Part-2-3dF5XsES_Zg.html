algorithm that we will consider is issue
so what happens during issue we take the
next instruction in program order from
the instruction queue this has to be
done in program order for register
renaming to work correctly we then need
to determine where the inputs of the
instructions are going to come from are
they already in the register file or are
they going to be produced by some of the
instructions that still hasn't broadcast
its result and if we need to wait for an
instruction which one so there will be
some sort of read table there we're then
going to get a free or available
reservation station of the correct kind
note that there are some reservation
stations that are for the others some of
them are for the multiplier so if this
is an add instruction then we really
need to find a available reservation
station in front of the other if all of
the reservation stations are busy at
this point meaning they're already used
by some other instructions and those
instructions haven't left yet then we
simply don't issue anything this cycle
and internal Solo's algorithm they were
issuing one instruction at a time so
they would just issue one instruction
per cycle we would put the instruction
in the reservation station then and we
will tag the destination register of the
instructions so that the result when
it's produced goes there and also so
that instructions that want that
register in the future will know which
instruction is going to produce this
value if it has already not been
produced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
