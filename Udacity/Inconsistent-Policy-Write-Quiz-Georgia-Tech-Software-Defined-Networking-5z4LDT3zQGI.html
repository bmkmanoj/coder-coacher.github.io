traffic engineering is the process of
reconfiguring the network in response to
changing traffic loads to achieve some
operational goal a network operator
might want to reconfigure the network in
response to changing loads to for
example maintain traffic ratios in a
peering relationship or to relieve
congestion on certain links in the
network or to balance load more evenly
across the available links in the
network in this lesson we will explore
different ways of performing traffic
engineering we will start by looking at
conventional approaches to traffic
engineering and we'll explore how
software-defined networking is used to
make the process of traffic engineering
easier in both data center networks and
transit networks IP networks must be
managed now in some sense IP networks
manage themselves there are several
examples of protocols on the internet
that in some sense manage themselves TCP
senders send less traffic during
congestion and routing protocols will
adapt to topology changes the problem is
that even though these protocols are
designed to adapt to various changes the
network may not run efficiently there
may be congested links when idle paths
exist or there might be a high delay
path that some traffic is taking when a
low delay path in fact exists so a key
question that traffic engineering tries
to address is how routing should adapt
to traffic in particular traffic
engineering attempts to avoid congested
links and satisfy certain application
requirements such as delay these are in
some sense the essential questions that
traffic engineering attempts to answer
in the rest of this lesson we will look
at how network operators can tune
routing protocol configuration to affect
how network traffic traverses the links
in the network and in particular we will
look at both intra domain traffic
engineering that is how to reconfigure
the protocols within a single autonomous
system to adjust traffic flow
as well as inter-domain traffic
engineering or how to adjust how traffic
flows between autonomous systems we will
also look at multipath routing and how
it is used to achieve various traffic
engineering goals let's start by looking
at how network operators can tune static
link weights in a routing protocol like
OSPF or is is to affect how traffic
flows through the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
