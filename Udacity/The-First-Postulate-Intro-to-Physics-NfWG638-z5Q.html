postulate from unifor so let's say you
wake up in a train but this isn't just
any train this is the Train of physics
and the thing that's so nice about the
Train of physics is that it has a
completely smooth ride it's silent and
the track is completely straighten also
the windows are blacked out so you can't
see outside so let's say you just woke
up in this train and you don't know if
it's still if it's at rest or if it's
moving at a constant speed my question
is what experiment can you do to
determine if the Train is moving at a
constant speed or if it's at rest on the
tracks maybe you could drop objects and
observe their trajectory as they fall
maybe you could push objects along the
floor of the Train and maybe by pushing
them forwards or pushing them backwards
you'd see something different the train
is moving or maybe you could hang a
pendulum from the ceiling and if the
train is moving forward maybe the
pendulum would be hanging in some
strange way okay so I want you to think
about these options and select all that
apply before you hit submit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
