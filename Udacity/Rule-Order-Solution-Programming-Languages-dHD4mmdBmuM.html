rule comes first just like it does here
on the page in some sense hello is
definitely a word but actually world in
quotes is also a word because this
quotation mark is not a space a left
angle or a right angle so if this comes
first we'd get word word which would
make us very unhappy on the other hand
if it comes after string then we'll end
up getting the behavior that we're
expecting however probably this white
space rule actually has to come first
lest we confuse white space and the body
of strings our word rule precludes us
from including spaces as parts of words
but our string rule really does not so
we probably want our white space rule to
come if not first somewhere near the top
that means that our word rule is the one
that comes last so if our final ordering
is either white space string word or
string white space word will get the
output we expect let's walk through the
first one and see how it goes we'll
start with the h and hello does that
match white space no it does not we'll
try our next rule does that match string
no it doesn't start with a double quote
could it match word oh it totally could
and now we'll use our maximum munch
power and it will eat up the e the ll 0
comma but it's going to stop his white
space has higher priority so we'll see
the word hello comma then we'll see the
space does that match the white space
rule it does so we'll pass over it then
we'll see these double quotes does that
match the white space rule no does it
match the string rule yes it does
maximal months will take us all the way
to the end of this token and we get the
output we expect the second case behaves
similarly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
