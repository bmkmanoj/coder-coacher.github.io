the kernel of spring and now we will
talk about how virtual memory management
happens in the spring operating system
there is a perm machine virtual memory
manager and the virtual memory manager
is in charge of managing the linear
address space of every process as we
know the linear address space of a
process is what the architecture gives
you and what the virtual memory manager
does is to break this linear address
space into regions and you can think of
regions as a set of pages so you take
this linear address space given by the
architecture that's the process address
space break that up into regions where
each region is a set of pages and each
region can be of different sizes the
second abstraction in the virtual memory
management system is what is called a
memory object and the idea of breaking
up this linear address space into
regions is to allow these regions to be
mapped to different memory objects so
for instance this region is mapped to
this memory object this region is mapped
to a portion of this memory object and
these two regions different regions of
the same address space are mapped to the
same memory object and this is perfectly
fine so this is how the virtual memory
manager takes the linear address space
and maps it to these memory objects and
what are these memory objects the
abstraction of a memory object allows a
region of virtual memory to be
associated with a backing file or it
could be to the swap space on the disk
and things like this so this memory
object is the mechanism by which
portions of the address space can be
mapped to different entities which may
be on the disk as swap space or files in
a file system all of those are available
through this abstraction of a memory
object so that regions in an address
space can be mapped to these backing
entities and it is also perfectly
possible that multiple memory objects
may map to the same backing file that is
also perfectly possible so the way to
think about these abstractions is linear
address space broke
the regions regions map to memory
objects and memory object is an
abstraction for things living on backing
store meaning a disk it could be the
swamp space on the disk or it could be
specific files that are being memory
mapped in order to access from a process
address space those are the abstractions
available in the virtual memory
management system now we will see how
these memory objects are then paged in
and brought into the physical memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
