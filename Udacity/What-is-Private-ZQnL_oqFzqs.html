we do online so let's sir dig deeper
into it what that we do online should be
considered private okay so what is
private and I think we really talking
about either data that is going to be
stored in in digital form and in in
computers or some activity that we do
and record of that activity is what
we're talking about so financial
statements we do online banking credit
card statements all these financial
records we would say you know that
should be private for two reasons it's
no one's business how I spend my money
or how much of it I have but if they
gain access to these of course they can
do identity theft health medical
conditions health information obviously
is highly sensitive and we don't want
that to be made public legal matters
there attorney-client privileges and
things like that well most people would
view that as something that is private
information if it's online in email
messages or in certain files that are
stored in a computer of course you would
view them as private information our
biometric fingerprint for example which
could be used for gaining access to
certain information you would think your
fingerprints shouldn't be arbitrarily
collected shared be made public and
things like that you would say this is
private as well your political beliefs
what party you belong to well you can
always sort of find out from what button
someone's wearing or what party they
contribute to but it's no one's business
if I don't want to make it public
remember it's your ability to control
when you're making a contribution or
when you're putting a button that
supports you know certain candidate you
choosing to do that ok so you village of
control is what privacy is all about so
my political belief unless I want to
disclose it there's no reason why
someone should find out about it
although we didn't talk about privacy
related laws but in the US their laws
that cover some of these held for
example HIPAA financial their servants
Oxley and things like that so you know
their privacy laws not only this in
mission is private considered private
but those who wallet privacy there could
be sanctions against them well if we go
on school record and your employment
record it's private most of us would
want to keep our annual evaluations
won't want them out in the public school
records you know how you do your grades
are actually covered again as regulation
for fun and things like that and more
interestingly our web browsing habits
what do we search what websites do we
visit what kind of websites if somebody
knew they maybe they know your political
beliefs for example so what we do online
that you would think that that's private
our communication that's not public
emails that you send a phone calls you
make and so on you would think that is
fry wait also Snowden we've been talking
a lot about metadata and stuff like that
a lot of people are upset and surprised
and some maybe not because we did think
phone calls we had control in the sense
that we knew that the government won't
collect information about those so
communication is it certainly think that
you would consider private and if you
sort of keep sort of going down this
line what we do on in cyberspace what
about tough that's about us that can be
seen by others online you know going
back to whenever what about past history
so then interestings are the right to be
forgotten this thing in the EU now that
we have and we'll explore it a bit more
says if there is information about me
that's irrelevant on I don't want Google
to actually return that as a result of a
search that somebody performs so if
there's information out there that was
collected and made public or made
available to somebody is that forever or
do I have the right to remove it at some
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
