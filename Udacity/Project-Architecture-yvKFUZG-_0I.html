project architecture by which I mean the
classes that will make up bicycles first
we have icicles game which is our
application listener the entry point
into our code icicles game will delegate
its application or listener callbacks to
one of two screens difficulty screen
which allows the user to select the
difficulty of the game and icicle screen
which contains the actual gameplay
icicle screen uses two other classes to
hold the state of the game world there's
player which handles the position of the
little stick figure down at the bottom
of the screen and also manages user
input and then there's icicles which
manages the position of all the icicles
icicles itself is basically a collection
of a bunch of icicle objects finally
we'll be very careful to keep all
constants in their own class there's two
reasons for this the first is that one
constants are spread all over the place
it becomes incredibly frustrating to
find the number that you want to tweak
if you want to change for instance how
fast the i-x calls drop you might need
to drill down into icicles game and then
go find a nice cool screen and maybe
it's nice clothes maybe it's in the
icicle singular class who knows where it
is we'll just keep all of those
constants in their own class even more
important is the fact that when you
develop games in a professional context
you're often building a platform that
allows artists and designers to easily
slot in their content you need to design
your game in such a way that your game
designer can add a new weapon or change
some balance easily or your artist can
swap out some art assets all without
needing your help rigorously using a
Constance class is a baby step in this
direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
