you've forgotten how sine and cosine and
dear friends work you may directly skip
to the quiz to check your knowledge sine
and cosine and their friends are about
right triangles this is a right triangle
triangle that has a right angle a and B
are the legs of the right triangle C is
the hypotenuse and I'm interested in
that angle which I call beta once this
angle is specified the ratio of every
two of these sides is fixed for instance
B divided by C is fixed once beta is
given that's called the sine of beta and
a divided by C it's given once beta is
known that's the cosine if we have a
different right triangle with the same
angle beta you see in this case the leg
B shrinks the same ratio as the leg C
shrinks so this ratio B over C stays
constant same for a divided by C a
shrinks C shrinks and the same ratio
this ratio a divided by C stays constant
it's a function of this angle beta alone
in daily life you would specify beta
with angular degrees 45 degrees 90
degrees 180 degrees in mathematics and
in most part of computer science you do
not use angular degrees you use radians
the idea is the following you look at
the unit circle a circle of radius one
if this is the angle I want to express
90 degrees I'm not using the number 19
degrees but I'm giving the length of the
part of the circumference that I'm
cutting off here the total circumference
would be 2
I a circle of radius 1 so this would be
PI / 2 and that's the angle in Radian 90
degrees become pi divided by 2 3 point 1
4 and so on divided by 2 a very ugly
number if I want to specify 45 degrees
that's of course just half of that
number pi divided by 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
