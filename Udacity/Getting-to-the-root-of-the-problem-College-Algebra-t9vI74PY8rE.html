this equation we need to set y equal to
0 remember that the roots are the
x-coordinates of the X intercepts which
is where y equals 0 now let's use the
quadratic formula to solve this plugging
the proper coefficients in to the proper
spots in the quadratic formula gives us
x equals negative 2 plus or minus the
square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1
times 10 all over 2 let's simplify well
this is getting pretty interesting look
at what I have underneath my square root
sign we end up with negative 2 plus or
minus the square root of negative 36
over to this is pretty shocking this
problem is asking us to take the square
root of a negative number we can't do
that we do not have any idea what real
number this would equal in fact there is
no real number that this equals so what
does this mean no solutions no crossing
the x-axis well we found a solution
let's take a peek at the graph so here's
the graph of y equals x squared plus 2x
Plus 10 remember when we were looking
for roots we're looking for the
x-coordinates of X intercepts of the
graph but look at where our vertex is
it's right here way above the x-axis and
our parabola is pointing upward that
means that the y coordinate of this
point right here is the smallest Y
cordon of any point on this graph in
other words because this is the minimum
point the graph is never going to get
any closer to the x-axis and so it's
never going to touch it at all this is
pretty fascinating the weird thing is
that we still got some sort of answer
you left and wait for the next lesson
though to find out what this means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
