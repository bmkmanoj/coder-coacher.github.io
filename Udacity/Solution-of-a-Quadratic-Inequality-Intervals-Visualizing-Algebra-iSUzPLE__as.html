would make this left hand side equal to
0 we can use these two values of x
equals 4 and x equals negative 3 to
create three separate intervals on a
number line these three intervals may
contain the numbers that are solutions
to our quadratic inequality for example
all the numbers to the left of negative
3 will either make this statement
positive or negative we can use a test
point within this interval or a test
value to find out for example I could
use the value x equals negative 4 to
determine whether or not this left side
is positive or negative we want this
side to be greater than zero so when I
plug in negative 4 I would want this to
be a positive number if that's the case
then every number from negative 3 and to
the left will make the statement
positive which means we include it in
our solution set so rewriting my
original inequality here I can plug in
the value of negative 4 and 4 X when we
evaluate this will get 8 is greater than
0 we know the statement is true so we
know all the values less than negative 3
are solutions to our original inequality
if you're in disbelief that all the
other numbers in here work then try
plugging in negative 5 or something like
negative 10 and for the value of x you
should wind up with a positive number on
this side here I've gone ahead and shown
you another check for x equals negative
8 if we use this value in interval one
will wind up with a statement 60 greater
than 0 we know this is true so again
this is part of our solution set we
don't need to test every value in
interval one we only need to test one of
them you try testing interval to and
interval three pick one value for x in
this region and in this region plug them
into your original inequality and see if
you come out with a true statement if
true then that interval is part of the
solution if false then that interval
will not be part of our solution also as
a hint think of an easy value to plug in
that's between negative 3 and positive
for what do you think is the easiest
value to use in between these two
numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
