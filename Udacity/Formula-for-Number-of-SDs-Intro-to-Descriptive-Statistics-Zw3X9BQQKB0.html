before we find our answer mu minus X
will give us a positive number because
mu is larger than X in both cases so
that's the first thing we did but that
doesn't tell us how many standard
deviations away from the mean X is X
minus mu will give us the opposite of
this one which is basically the negative
distance X minus mu times Sigma doesn't
really make sense that would be
multiplying this distance by the
standard deviation X minus mu divided by
Sigma is closer to what we did but this
will give us the negative distance
however later you'll see that this
equation is very important and again we
didn't multiply by Sigma so this is the
correct answer to find just how far in
terms of standard deviations X is from
the mean we found the distance which is
mu minus X and then we divided by the
standard deviation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
