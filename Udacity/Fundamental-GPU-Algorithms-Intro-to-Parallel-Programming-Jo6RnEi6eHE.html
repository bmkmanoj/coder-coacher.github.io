lecture 3 this lecture is going to be on
fundamental GPU algorithms we're going
to cover three different algorithms
today reduce scan and histogram so GPU
computing is based on exploiting
concurrency in a workload expressing
that concurrency language like CUDA
allows parallel implementations on the
GPU that can take advantage of hundreds
of simultaneous computations now the GPU
is well suited to communication patterns
that are completely independent like the
map operation so in the map operation
we're going to have a number of
computational elements and each one of
them will compute its output in parallel
and completely separately without any
communication whatsoever it's also great
at stencil or more generally gather
operations like we saw in the last
lecture so we might have an item we want
to compute here and we're going to go
out and fetch several items for memory
and do our computation but the
computation of next item is again
completely separate from the computation
of the first one however not all
communications fall into these
categories some of them have more
complex computation patterns such as all
to one or all to many communication
patterns so for instance this element
here depends on these three elements
here in the computation of this element
here will depend on these three elements
and notice that there's some overlap
here so it's a little bit more
complicated so we'll cover these more
complex computation patterns and three
primitives that can implement them in
today's lecture these primitives are
reduce scan and histogram and we'll also
use them in this week's homework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
