well so through all of this we finally
figured out what decision trees actually
are we know what they represent we not
expressive they are we have an algorithm
that lets us build the decision trees in
an effective way we've done just about
everything there is to do with decision
trees but there's still a couple of open
questions that I want to think about so
here's a couple of them I want you to
think about and then we'll discuss them
so so far all of our examples that we've
used all the things that we've been
thinking about for good pedagogical
reasons we had not only discrete outputs
but we also had discrete inputs so one
question you might ask ourselves is what
happens if we have continuous attributes
so Michael let me ask you this let's say
we had some continuous attributes we
weren't just asking whether someone was
an animal or whether they're human or
whether it was raining outside but we
really cared about age or weight or
distance or anything else they might
have a continuous attribute how we're
going to make that work in a decision
tree well I guess the literal way to do
it would be for something like H to have
a branching factor that's equal to the
number of possible ages okay so that's
one up one possibility so we stick an
age and then we have one point zero we
have one for one point one we have one
for one point one one to have one for
one point one
I see all right well at the very least
okay what if what if we only included
ages that were in the training set
presumably there's at least a finite
number of those oh we could do that we
could just do that except what are we
going to do then when we come up with
something in the future that wasn't in
the training set
oh right can we look at the testing set
no we're not allowed to look at the
testing set that is cheating and not the
kind of good cheating that we do when we
pick good representation okay fair
enough
well we could we could ranges what about
ranges and that the way we cover more
than just individual values give me an
example say ages you know in the 20s
okay
so huh how would we represent that with
a decision tree let's say in the 20s age
you could do like age element sine
bracket 20 20 comma 21 29 30 right paren
yeah that's too much why don't I just
say age is between less is that C
greater than or equal to 20 and less
than 30 I just draw a big oval for that
right so that's a range so that's all
numbers between 20 and 30 inclusive of
20 but not 30 right yep ah and what's
good about that is that's a question you
are either in your 20s or you or not
so the output of that is actually true
or false so I guess the good news there
is that now we know how to evaluate
attributes like that because we have a
format formula from id3 that tells us
what to do but seems like there's an
awful lot of different ones to check
right and in fact if it's truly a
continuous variable there are in
principle an infinite number of them to
check but we can do now the sort of
cheating you wanted to do before we
could just look at the training set and
we could try to pick questions that
cover the sorts of data in the training
set so for example if all of the values
are in the 20s then there's no point of
even asking the question you'd start to
split instead upon values that were say
less than 25 or greater than 25
and you can imagine all kinds of ways
where you might do that you might look
at all of the values that show up in the
training set and say well I'm going to
do a binary search so I'm just going to
create an attribute for less than half
of whatever's in the training set or
greater than half of whatever the ranges
in the training set that make sense yeah
that's that's clever
right thank you I just made that up on
the spot okay so you do those sorts of
things and that's how you would deal
with continuous attributes that brings
me to the next question I'm going to
actually do this as a quiz because I
want an answer from our audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
