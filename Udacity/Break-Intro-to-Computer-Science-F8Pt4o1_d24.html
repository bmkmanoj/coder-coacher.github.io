about factorial you might think you
deserve a break and you almost do but we
have one more thing to learn about while
loops and that's the break statement
break gives us way to stop the loop even
while the test condition is true so
here's the typical structure of a loop
with a break so we have the while as we
did before and we have the test
expression and we had a colon and our
general while structure is we had a
block here now I'm going to look inside
this block a little bit to see the kinds
of things that could be here and this is
just an example of what might be in the
block we have some code we have some
Python statements then we have an if
statement and that's going to have
another test expression we'll call that
the break test that's the test
expression that's checking whether it's
time to take a break and when the break
test is true what we have is break which
by itself is all we need what break
means is stop executing the while loop
jump out of the while loop and continue
with the code after that so whatever we
had here this is more code that was in
the wild block that will get skipped and
we'll jump to this point which is the
code after the while so what happens
when we execute a loop with a break it
executes s-- like a normal loop if the
test expression is true we go to the
code if the break test is false
we don't execute the break we would
continue with the more code we would go
back to the loop test check the test
expression again if it's true we go run
this code if the break test is true then
we execute the break and what break does
is jump out of the loop so we don't
execute the more code we don't execute
the test expression again if the break
happens what happens is we jump to the
code after the while this gives us a way
to break out of the middle of the loop
here's an example of how we might use
that so before we define the procedure
print numbers without using break we
defined it like this so this is the code
we had before we could rewrite that
using break so now instead of having the
while test stop the loop will make the
while test true true will never become
false that means if we didn't have a
break the loop would keep going for
but we're gonna add a break we're gonna
have an if test that says well the
stopping condition now is we're gonna
stop once I is greater than n and the
way to stop is to use brake if I is not
greater than n then we're gonna keep
going we'll do the same thing we did
before we'll print I and we'll add one
two so this loop has exactly the same
meaning as the one we had before the
previous one's better in every way right
so this is more complex as more code
this illustrates how we can use break we
wouldn't want to do it this way this is
much worse than what we had before we
want to keep our code simple and easy to
understand we'll see once we get to the
code for extracting all the links on the
page that there are cases where it's
easier to write the code using break
than it is without that so now we're
gonna have a quiz to see that you
understand why loops as well as break
this is going to be a pretty tough quiz
that you have to think carefully about
how while loops are defined and what
break means the question is which of the
following are always equivalent to while
any test expression T and a block which
is any statement s so T and s could be
anything
and your question is to understand which
of these are equivalent to that so here
are the four choices the first one we
have a while loop with a nested if the
second one we have a while loop with the
statement and a break the third choice
we have a while loop with a nested if
and the fourth choice we have the while
loop with a nested if and an else in a
break so your goal is to check all the
ones that are equivalent to the while T
s where T and s can be any test
expression in any state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
