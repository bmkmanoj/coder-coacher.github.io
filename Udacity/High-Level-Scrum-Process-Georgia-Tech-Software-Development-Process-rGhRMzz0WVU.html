providing a high-level view of the scrum
process the process is represented here
and as you can see it's got several
components we're going to go through all
of them one at a time
we're gonna start with a product backlog
product backlog is the single source of
requirements for the process their order
by value risk priority necessity so that
all of this characteristics can be taken
into account when selecting which
backlog items to consider for the next
iteration it's a living list in the
sense that backlog items can be added or
removed and it's normally defined as
which are said by the product owner in
the sprint planning what happens is that
the next increment or the next sprint is
defined so basically the backlog items
of interest are selected based on the
characteristic we just mentioned value
risk priority and necessity and the
items are converted into tasks and
estimated so the result is this print
backlog which is the set of backlog
items they will be completed during the
next sprint the Sprint is an actual
iteration of the scrum process it's got
a main part that lasts two to four weeks
and within this main part there are many
daily scrums
that last 24 hours so let's see how this
work a daily scrum is typically
characterized by a 15-minute meeting at
the beginning of the day for the team to
sync and what happens during the meeting
is that there is a discussion of the
accomplishments since the last meeting a
to-do list for the next meeting is
produced and there's also an obstacle
analysis so if some problem appear there
discussing the daily scrum and possible
solutions are proposed at the end of a
two four-week cycle there is a sprint
review and retrospective the sprint
review normally consists of a four-hour
meeting in the meeting the product owner
assesses the accomplishment for the
specific sprint and the team discusses
issues that were encountered and solved
there's typically a demo of the
deliverable for that sprint and at that
point the product owner will also
discuss the backlogs and together with
the team they will decide what to do
next in the retrospective conversely
what happens is that there is more focus
on the process so the goal of that part
of the meeting is discussing possible
process improvements to identify them
and if promising improvements are
identified try to plan how to implement
those improvements and use them in the
next iterations and something else that
might happen at
the end of a sprint is that if the
product increment is good enough as
reach the state in which Encana actually
shipped that will result in a release
that is not just internal to show the
product owner the progress I can also be
deployed and actually used in production
so one final consideration is that as
you can see XP and scrum are fairly
similar and that's because they're both
HR development processes so the main
thing to keep in mind is that they both
implement and enforce those ideas values
practices and characteristics then we
saw when we discussed the agile
development process in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
