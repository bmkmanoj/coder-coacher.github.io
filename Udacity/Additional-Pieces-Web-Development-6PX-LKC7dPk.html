of this lecture um there's not gonna be
another quiz but I just want to show you
some more pieces and what would be a
kind of a full web stack for a major
website that we haven't really talked
about yet so we spent a lot of time in
this lecture talking about the app
servers and databases in cache and the
relationship between all these things we
also mention briefly a load balancer
there are some more pieces in here that
a large website may have so right now
requests go from the load balancer to
the App servers who then go to the DBS
or to the cache what if we get so much
traffic that one load balancer can't
handle it well then we can add a second
load balancer but what load balances the
load balancer well generally you do
something called DNS round-robin and
what this means is DNS is the system
that converts a domain name into an IP
address and that generally doesn't
happen on your machines or that's rather
that's cached all over the Internet
there are dns machines all over the
internet that all cache each other's
information so what you would do is you
would give you know a website like
udacity.com
instead of mapping to you know one IP it
may map to you know multiple IPS one for
each load balancer and then different
machines and different parts of the
world or different times of day or on
different requests might get sent to
different load balancers and that's one
way at a very very high level to spread
huge amounts of traffic across multiple
load balancers another thing you may
have either behind your load balancers
or in front of them is another cache and
there and this is like basically just
that just an HTML cache and this cache
may intercept requests before they even
get to the app server and this may cache
HTML and images you know all sorts of
stuff that we know are not going to
change for this user say it's a it's a
request comes in with no cookies so we
know the user isn't logged in we don't
have to do any dynamic requests don't
have to do anything special well we can
just cash the entire result of the page
you know then all of the HTML we're
going to turn not just the database
query some examples of this technology
are varnish it's a really popular one we
use this at a Reddit and Hipmunk it's
really nice um
squid is another one and a lot of people
build their own because if you're at
this scale you probably you there's a
high likelihood that you need a custom
solution here but you can have basically
more caches in front of your app server
another thing you can do is use what's
called a CDN and say you know you've got
the whole internet here and a CDN is
basically a content delivery network and
these are usually third-party companies
that you would pay to cache your content
all over the internet so they would
intercept your DNS requests you know
they have they'll have machines all over
the world you have your you basically
have your DNS instead of pointing at
your load balancers point at the CDN and
it may point that you know maybe maybe
do some round-robin think to different
machines and that sort of thing but
basically these machines are just big
caches just kind of like this farness
cache here that say okay before I even
send their request to my customer do i
already have it cached and and these are
just basically just a big cache so the
name of the game is caching and and the
question is you know at what level do
you cache and we've only been talking
about caching TV requests but you can
also cache you know entire responses or
you can pay somebody else to cache the
entire response all over the internet
and a lot of the biggest websites do
this you know reddit pays a third-party
company to do so you know Facebook and
Google have data centers all over the
world and so they do it themselves
but you know as you grow and grow and
grow the challenge is you know how much
of this content actually is different on
every request and how much is the same
and content that is the same can be
cached and you push that cache further
and further away from you and closer and
closer to your customer to get higher
and higher speeds and when the content
can't be cached you need to add lots of
app servers and internal cache is an
internal you know the custom systems for
dealing with this type of load so that's
kind of how the whole picture may look
you know once you're at it at a huge
scale so I hope you enjoyed this lecture
a lot of the stuff in this lecture I
kind of learned the hard way on reddit
doing you know starting with one machine
and then two machines and splitting
apart the services and all of that made
a lot of mistakes along the way and
actually in unit 7 is when I'll talk
specifically about the process we went
through of going from one machine to
many machines as we were growing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
