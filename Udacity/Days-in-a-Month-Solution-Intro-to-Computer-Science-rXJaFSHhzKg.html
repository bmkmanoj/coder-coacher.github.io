days so we have our initial definition
of days and month we're going to define
a procedure how many days and it takes
one numbers input we'll call that the
month and what we want to do is return
the number of days in that month we can
find that by indexing into the days in
month list and we want the element that
corresponds to the month that was passed
in that isn't the element of the month
directly because elements in the list
start from 0 once start from 1 so we
need to subtract 1 from month to get the
correct element let's try that so we'll
print the number of days in month 1
which is January and we run and we get
31 let's try month 9 which is September
and we run and we get 30 what happens if
we pass in say a number that's not a
valid month so let's say we pass in 13
so now we run this and what we get is an
error and you can see what the error is
is complaining that the list index is
out of range that means we've tried to
find an element in a list that doesn't
exist and we did it exactly at this
point where we were returning days and
months of month minus 1 and the value of
month was 13 there's no element at
position 12 because days and months only
has 12 elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
