in this lesson and you had no real
trouble filling out this concept map
let's actually start here in the center
monogenic traits and we'll just say that
they're caused by alleles in single
genes and we learned about alleles and
jeans more in lessons three enforce if
you want a refresher you can go back
there let's take the traits in the order
that we discuss them on the lesson a
monogenic trait one example is red-green
color blindness which is inherited and
caused by an x-linked allele the gene is
located on the X chromosome and we know
that it is something and something most
likely from the given word bank here
we're looking for words like
gain-of-function loss of function and
dominant or recessive but the question
is which one goes in which box well it's
whichever one in this box it has in
common with osteogenesis imperfecta so
let's go down this route osteogenesis
imperfecta is inherited and caused by an
autosomal allele right it's not on a sex
chromosome it's on an autism now
osteogenesis imperfecta was dominant but
loss of function and red-green color
blindness was recessive and loss of
function the one thing they have in
common is the fact that the allele was
loss of function so we know that belongs
in that box there this means for
red-green colorblindness recessive
belongs in this box which is what it has
in common with sickle cell anemia and we
know that if something is recessive then
in its heterozygous state the individual
would be unaffected and only when the
individual is homozygous are they
actually affected now this was also true
for sickle cell anemia which is also
inherited and caused by an autosomal
allele not on a sex chromosome but on an
autozone sickle cell anemia is recessive
but a gain-of-function and sickle cell
anemia has this property in common with
achondroplasia which is also inherited
and caused by an autosomal allele the
allele Acosta's achondroplasia is
gain-of-function and dominant it shares
this dominant status with osteogenesis
imperfecta even though osteogenesis
imperfecta was a loss of functional
now dominant alleles if they're
heterozygous then the individual is
affected and in these particular cases
as is true for some other dominant
traits the homozygous version is
actually lethal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
