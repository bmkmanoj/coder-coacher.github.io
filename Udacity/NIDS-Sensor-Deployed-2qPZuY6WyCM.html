deployment here's an example enterprise
network configuration the internal
network has multiple subnets and the
enterprise has public facing services
such as a public web server recall our
lecture on firewalls we typically want
to place an external firewall to protect
the entire enterprise network in
addition we want to protect the internal
network from the public facing servers
these servers are put in what we called
a DMZ and we use internal firewalls to
monitor traffic between an internal
subnet and a DMZ the internal firewalls
also monitor traffic between 8 subnets
so that's the deployment of firewalls
but what about IDs a common location for
an IDs sensor is just inside the
external firewall this position has a
number of advantages obviously you can
see attacks from the outside world by
comparing the logs of the firewall and
ideas we can also find out whether the
firewall had missed an attack that each
have prevented the ideas at this
location can also detect attacks they
are targeted at the public facing
servers in addition because it can
analyze all outgoing traffic of the
entire enterprise network you can also
detect attacks from a compromised server
either from DMZ or the internal network
a network IDs can also be placed between
the external Network and Internet the
main advantage of this location is that
the network IDs can see all attempted
attacks to the enterprise network
including those attacks that can be
filtered by the firewalls for example if
the firewall is overloaded it would not
only job the incoming packet it may not
even have resource to log this packet
but an IDs at this location can see the
packet and log it
therefore the IDS can see all attempted
attacks in addition to deploying never
ideas at the perimeter we can also
deploy an era ideas to protect a subnet
or set of servers a network ideas at
this location can perform more detailed
analysis of traffic data because
compared with our network ideas at the
perimeter he has smaller amount of
traffic volume due to the fact that he
only monitors traffic to a subnet and
service in addition it can also detect
intrusions from inside a network in
addition to protecting our servers and
network ideas can also be placed to
protect the workstations or networks of
important personnel or departments a
network ideas at this location can focus
on targeted attacks for example attacks
that are targeted at financial
transaction systems compared with an
ideas at the narrow perimeter which must
examine traffic to the whole network an
IDs at this location can instead focus
on traffic to these high-value systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
