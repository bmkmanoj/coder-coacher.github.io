called foxes and hens now that happens
to be another game called foxes and hens
which is a checkers like game but this
one's different this one's a card game
so there should be a deck of cards we're
going to simulate those on the computer
and here's a scenario that were that the
game is trying to talk about so we have
a yard into which some free range
chickens can roam and I'm going to give
up on my drawing skills and go to
schematic so a chicken walks into the
yard some time later another chicken
walks into the yard and at some point a
fox may come and when the Fox arrives it
eats all the chickens and everything's
gone so this deck of cards each card has
either a fox or chicken on it and we
flip the cards over one at a time to see
who arrives next now we're playing this
game as a one-person solitaire version
and the way the game works is we're
going to take the whole deck of cards
flip them all over and before we flip
each card the player has a choice so the
player says should I gather up the
chickens that are in the yard so that'll
be one possible action and if I gather
them up than here there's two chickens I
would get two points but the car that
gets turned over whether it be a fox or
a chicken that animal would get scared
by my gathering action and would run
away and be lost for other the other
action I can take is wait so I just
watch the chickens in the yard wait for
the next one to arrive and if it's a
chicken then I'm in luck and there's one
more in the yard once they're in the
yard I spread out enough chicken feed
that they won't leave so they'll always
be there and I can wait for more
chickens to accumulate within the yard
and then when I gathered them I'll get a
higher score but if I wait too long and
a fox arrives by flipping over the card
and getting a fox then I lose all the
chickens and so my choice then is before
each card is unveiled either gather or
wait then we see what card is unveiled
we get a new state now if you're
familiar with playing blackjack in Vegas
you'll know that if you try to count
your cards you get in big trouble and
you get kicked out but here Counting
ards is legal and at the start of the
game you know exactly how many cards
there are how many of each kind there
are boxes and hands but of course
they're randomly shuffled so you don't
know which one's going to come up next
so the state of the game then is defined
by the score the number of chickens I've
gathered so far the number of chickens
currently in the yard and the complete
collection of cards that haven't been
dealt yet so we're assuming you have
perfect memory for counting cards and
you know exactly how many cards of each
kind are left but of course you don't
know which one's going to come up next
now this is a partnership so I've
written some and i'm going to call on
you to write some here's a top-level
function we call it foxes and hence it
takes a strategy of a single player
strategy and it takes the number of
cards of each type in the deck here we
have a 52 card deck of which there are
seven foxes it creates that deck as a
string of F and h's and the initial
state then is the cards as a string of
52 characters the score is zero in the
number of chickens in the yard is zero
and then we just go through the whole
deck we're going to be popping off a
card from the deck each time and we ask
the strategy function for an action and
then we're going to find and I'm going
to ask you to define this do a function
which does an action to a state and
returns a new state and that's going to
be the score at the yard and the cards
and we keep going until the cards has
gotten down to zero so every time you do
a do action there's going to be one less
cards in the state that gets returned
and at the end you get the score and I
don't think I mentioned this rule yet
but at the very end you automatically
get to gather all of the chickens that
are left in the yard if there are any
remaining so your score should be the
score you've accumulated so far plus
whatever's in the yard so I want you to
write this do function remember that
there are only two actions gather and
wait so do has to apply those it has to
pick a random card out of the cards
figure out what to do with that
according to the action and then return
the new score and yard and the set of
cards without that card the set of cards
with that card removed
and the cards have to be represented as
a string rather than as a Python set now
I've given you a sample strategy for
playing the game I call this strategy
take five I wrote this function there's
no truth to the rumor that Paul Desmond
and Dave Brubeck wrote it and the way it
works is it waits until there are five
hens in the yard and then it gathers
them up now here's a function for
computing the average score of a
strategy over n number of games where n
defaults to a thousand and what I asking
you to do is to write your strategy
function strategy function here that
takes a state and does whatever you want
here I've had to just return something
but you should alter your code to do the
right thing and we want to make you to
make sure that your strategy is superior
and what a superior mean it means that
your strategies average score compared
to the average score of take five must
be one and a half points better on
average so keep working on your strategy
until you can come up with one that's
superior if you want you can try to
figure out how to define the optimal
strategy but you don't need to do that
as long as you beat take five x 1.5
points</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
