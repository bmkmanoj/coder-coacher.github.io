restaurant script here is a name of the
script restaurant and it's six elements
that we talked about earlier track props
roles entries result in scenes so this
particular track refuse to formal dining
here are the props tables menu check
money food and plays and for food in
place we can use symbols these symbols
can be used as variables where I may
have different kinds of food and
different kinds of places in a
restaurant here are the rules so s is a
customer w is a waiter see is a cook em
is a cashier or is the owner and so on
the entry conditions are if s is hungry
s remember is a customer SS money the
result conditions are that s as less
money as is not hungry as is pleased but
o has more money and seems well let's
discuss them in the next slide here is a
representation of seen one will call it
the entering seen this particular scene
consists of several events it's in the
first frame the customer s S stands for
the customer moves himself or herself so
s is moving himself or herself to some
restaurant some place p and the second
frame the agent s the customer sees some
table so in this frame the customer s
decides to take an action the particular
action is where this agent s the
customer s moves customer s himself or
herself to the table so this is a
walking action going on let us continue
this analysis just a little bit longer
so now s is moving his own body into a
sitting position here the waiter sees
the customer another waiter moves
himself to the customer and now the
waiter moves the menu to the customer
and this completes a representation of
the first scene of entering in a
restaurant now one can imagine many more
scenes the next scene might be where the
customer orders would third scene might
be where the waiter brings food and so
on and so forth under the last limited
customer pays the bill and it walks out
this is a stereotypical notion of a
script your notion of a script might be
slightly different depending over the
kinds of restaurants that you go to and
different cultures the script for going
to a restaurant might be quite different
the point here is that the script is
capturing in a knowledge representation
what is known about the stereotypical
situation of going to a restaurant for
particular kind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
