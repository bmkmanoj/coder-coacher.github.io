he was a previous founder of X site and
old search engine company and then
eventually he did his own new start
called jot spot at the time which was
like this freemium software-as-a-service
wiki company and they had set up pricing
and in his talk at YC it just made sense
it was like oh we thought about pricing
by the top and tier of the pricing would
be stuff that people didn't need to get
like permission from legal or financial
or get a special like document or review
done that people can just pay it on the
corporate credit card two hundred
dollars a month he said seems to be what
the limits are for that and then we
stepped down the features based on usage
downwards and then we always knew we
wanted to have a freemium plan or a free
plan that people can try out the service
because like we felt like our user
experience was going to be what sells a
lot of what we fir does although I think
completely different about that now when
I when I advise companies about going
freemium but that's how it started is
just starting with his pricing like that
made sense and then we figured out the
tears like where was going to be to cut
us for the functionality just based on
like in our competitors like pears what
they do can we be more generous do we
have a guess on like what's gonna make
us different or what have you and I
think one of the best things that we did
is we offer plants that offered
unlimited forms because this idea is
like you get them hooked into this idea
that you can use forms for anything and
everything and yes everyone's going to
come in on one vertical or one very
specific use case but if you have it the
idea it's like oh there's an unlimited
resource of this think of these things
which it kind of truly is because the
marginal cost of building another form a
lot of people to make another one it
costs us nothing and so like it's easy
to be generous on that but what we want
to do is like hook that meant we're like
now everyone in the organization using
we flew from all different kinds of use
cases and then they start thinking about
problem solving in the wofford way it's
like oh I can use Weaver for this I can
you do this for this or do this for this
and then that's like what makes a
subscription business do really well is
that when people start relying you on in
a long-term relationship sort of way is
like oh this is a long term solution for
lots of different problems in the
company I think what's tricky is like we
fuse one of those generalized products
or it could be used for lots of
different stuff we had every industry
market or vertical using gufu and that
is because forms
like this first step of interaction of
collecting data interacting with people
and so creativity was always our biggest
problem like people not knowing what do
I do with this it sounds neat but how do
I use low is it so we spent a lot of
time on education they get people that
get hooked on in their first use case so
that way they will eventually learn to
other ways to use it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
