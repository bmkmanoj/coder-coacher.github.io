learning concepts incrementally we
always have a specific model and a
general model as a new example comes
along we ask ourselves is this a
positive example of the concept to be
learned or a negative example of the
concept that we learned if it's a
positive example then we generalize the
specific model if there's a negative
example with specialized the general
model it is another set of
visualizations to understand the
specific internal models this is the
specific model this is the general model
the most specific model might is exactly
one thing the four-legged furry black
animal called buddy
the most general model matches
everything all animals here is a current
specific model unless more positive
examples come we're going to generalize
this specific model here are some of the
generalizations similarly here is the
current general model and as a negative
examples come we're going to specialize
the general model and here are some of
the specializations as we'll illustrate
in a minute or start with the most
general model and try to specialize it
some of these generalizations and
specializations that we are creating
with no longer match the current data
when that happens we'll prune them out
as we prune on this side as well on this
side the two pathways may merge
depending on the ordering of the example
when they do much we have our solution
the right generalization of the concept
for the given examples so far we have
been talking about this in very abstract
terms let's make this concrete with an
illustration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
