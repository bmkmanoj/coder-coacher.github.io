structure that can be used to very
rapidly compute shortest path distances
between nodes in a network the way that
it worked was each node of the network
has a label and what a label is is a
list of other nodes in the network that
he called hubs along with the distance
to that hub and the hubs are chosen for
each node the labels are chosen for each
node so that they have the property that
for any two nodes in the network any two
nodes where you want to compute a
shortest path length between them they
will have some hub in common in their
labels that is on the shortest path
between those nodes so let's make sure
that you have a feel for this idea and
let's look at a particular kind of
network a star network where there is
one mode in the middle and all these
other notes directly connected to it how
many hubs do we need to list in the
labels of each of the nodes in a star
network so that we can make sure that we
satisfy this property that we can
compute the shortest path length
sufficiently specifically because for
any pair of nodes in the network their
labels will have some hub in common so
once you type the number into the box
you can use this particular star network
as your example and give the answer for
this star network but it turns out it
actually works for star star networks of
any size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
