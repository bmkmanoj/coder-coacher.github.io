method to come up with an expression for
W at the n plus one step we know that
we're going to need an expression for W
dot so that's the first thing we deal
with beginning with our equation for the
force of friction we know that the
acceleration of the wheel depends on the
force of friction divided by the mass of
the wheel so we plug in this expanded
version of the equation for the force of
friction into the equation for W dot and
of course subtract B and the backward
Euler method says that W at the n plus
one step is equal to W at the end step
plus the step size times the change in W
at the n plus one step so now that we
have our expression for WD you can plug
it into the proper location in the
equation below we've rewritten s the
wheel slip to see here and here as 1
minus W at the enthalpy us one step over
V which of course is just an equivalent
expression this gets rid of any explicit
dependence on us you'll remember from
what I said earlier that V here changes
much more slowly than W does so we
didn't specify which V were referring to
right here but if we were to be more
clear this is V sub n plus 1 there was a
little bit of rearranging we can rewrite
this equation for W at n plus 1 as this
equation right here now it may seem
slightly counterintuitive to rearrange
things like this since this expression
looks maybe longer and more awkward than
this one does remember however that our
initial request for W was that it obey
an equation of the form that I wrote up
here we have a term with W sub n plus 1
and a term with e to that value and also
a constant all of us added together
equaling 0 that is exactly what we have
down here now this makes our job very
simple remember we wanted to identify
what's cdf and KR and now we can just
read them directly off of this equation
in order to implement the backward Euler
method in the code now all we have to do
is translate the variables cdf and k
into code just like I've done right here
the expression for W that the solver is
going to output is equivalent to the one
that we just found using the backward
Euler method so it's very simple since
the solver was already established for
us all we had to do is fill in the
proper values for these variables in the
introduction video I didn't talk much
about what this solver is actually doing
so now I'll just take a second to
explain that it's implementing something
called the newton-raphson method this is
a method used for solving implicit
equations that are not linear so it's a
perfect fit for the situation that we're
faced with right now now let's say I
have a function like this green curve
right here for which I want to find the
x value of a certain point maybe for
example I'd like to find the x value of
this x-intercept right here so the thing
that we actually know about this point
then is the Y value which is 0 to use
the newton-raphson method i start by
making a guess at what the x value that
pairs at that y value is so maybe I
guess the x-coordinate that corresponds
to this blue line right here what the
newton-raphson method does is it takes
the slope of the line tangent to the
green curve at this point so maybe that
tangent line looks a little something
like this and extends that line down to
the y value that we're interested in now
the next x value that i'll guess is
going to be the point where that tangent
line intersects the x axis in this case
then i'll do the same thing for this
point and so on and so forth and
eventually my results will converge to
the actual point that i'm looking for
this is a very effective method for
solving implicit equations the general
equation showing the movement from one
guess to the next guess is shown right
here so we can specify this to deal with
the situation we're looking at by using
this equation right here and in fact
that is exactly what's written in the
Code in this expression for W
underscored new now that we understand
how our solver is working let's look at
the plot we get what we have here is a
series of plots that all depend on time
first we have position then car velocity
then weíll velocity and then wheel slip
the different series shown by the
different colors in each plot represent
different values for the magnitude of
the braking acceleration if you zoomed
in really close in the different parts
of the top graph you'll be able to tell
that 70 meters per second squared is the
blue line 100 meters per second squared
is the green line 130 the red line 160
the cyan line and 190 the magenta line
so we can see then how different
breaking accelerations affect these four
different quantities interestingly
enough it's the 130 meters a second
breaking which is one of the middle
values that makes the car stop first and
we slam on the brakes really hard which
has shown up the magenta and cyan lines
the wheels stop rotating very quickly
and see the wheel velocity goes to 0
right away however in tandem with that
the wheel slip increases dramatically
and the wheels are locked very early on
as a result the car velocity doesn't
actually slow down much of course as we
would
if we just don't put the brakes on very
hard like with the blue line then the
car does go a pretty far distance and it
actually doesn't come to a stop at all
on the time that we've allowed however
this is a great example of how slamming
on your brakes is not the most effective
breaking method great job on this
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
