vision today we're gonna start heading
up the computer vision food chain we
started with basic images as functions
we did something image processing edge
detection manipulation then we did some
low-level computation of vision things
like motion stereo we considered some
geometries such as things like essential
and fundamental matrices that related
how cameras reviewing a scene panoramas
sift features etc even the tracking of
objects but all of that stuff was really
semantic free and what I mean by
semantic free is there was no notion of
what the object was what you and I would
refer to it so I look at the table I see
a cup of coffee that I paid way too much
money for it's some really expensive
coffee shop because that's what we all
do in academia these days but it is that
I know that that thing is a cup of
coffee so for this section and a little
bit of the discussions we going forward
we're gonna be talking about recognition
recognition being the labeling of the
object and particular we typically think
of it as labeling objects with labels
that humans would understand the other
thing I want to say before we begin is
we're only gonna do a little bit of this
and that's because object recognition
has become hugely driven by machine
learning machine learning is a general
field where you have lots of data that
some of which is often labeled or
supervised describe what's there and you
have training data and use that to be
able to do label or categorize or
describe some new novel input we're
gonna talk a little bit about that but
only a little because machine learning
is such a big field that if you want to
understand more of the details you
almost need to take an entire machine
learning course so we'll be touching on
the underlying machine learning methods
especially a couple lessons from now but
mostly we'll try to talk a bit about how
it's been applied to a computer vision
scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
