a semi implicit solver to model just a
single corner of a car and its motion
you saw a diagram that looked pretty
much just like this in the unit now all
of these arrows represent different
types of quantities but they're just
useful for showing direction V here
represents the velocity of the car w is
the tangential velocity of the wheel mqc
is the mass of one quarter of the car
and therefore mqc times g is equal to
the gravitational force on this quarter
of the car f here represents friction or
the force of friction that is acting in
this direction against the motion of the
car the force of friction is a function
of s which stands for wheel slip we can
write out the equation for the force of
friction just like this the force of
friction is equal to as you seen before
the coefficient of kinetic friction
which is a function of wheel slip times
the normal force which in this case has
magnitude equal to that of the
gravitational force we can relate some
other important quantities to the force
of friction from right here we can see
that V dot or the acceleration of the
car is impacted negatively by the force
of friction change in the velocity of
the wheel depends both on the force of
friction and on B which is the braking
acceleration as here as you'll remember
stands for wheel slip as I just said we
also however have this expression from
you the coefficient of kinetic friction
your first task in this problem is going
to be to find an equation for W at the
end plus one time step that fits this
form right here in this equation C D F
and k all could depend a number of
different things for example they might
depend on W sub n on each the time step
on the mass of a quarter of the car on
effective mass of the wheel em eat help
you right here on G the acceleration due
to gravity on be the braking
acceleration or on V the velocity for V
which you see right here we're going to
use V sub n because as it turns out V
changes very slowly compared to W in
fact what we have is a stiff system of
differential equations you remember from
our work earlier on in the course that
stiff systems of differential equations
require you to use a very small step
size or also end up with completely
unreasonable results if you want to test
this out try plugging in H equals 0.1 so
for the step size and see what kind of
craziness ensues in order to figure out
what to plug in for CDF and kay here we
want you to use the backward Euler
method along with the information that
we've given you here looking at the code
you can see that we've given you a
substantial portion of the program
already in fact we've handed you this
solver right here since we're asking you
to use the backward Euler method which
is an implicit method you're going to
end up with an equation that is not
linear and therefore you can't solve
explicitly once you've used the backward
Euler method to come up with values for
C EDF and K we want you to use this
solver in conjunction with the backward
Euler method to come up with an
expression for W at step plus 1 in the
solution video I'll give you a more
in-depth explanation of what the solver
is doing and how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
