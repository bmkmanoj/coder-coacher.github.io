I'll call solution number zero because
it's really not even approaching a
solution is to have pairwise shared keys
and the idea here is for everyone
whoever might want to communicate to get
together form keys between them so let's
say this is Alice Bob Colleen Diana
someone whose name starts with E and
some of these name starts with F and
Alice would set up a pair Y shared key
secretly communicating with each with
other people bob has a shared key with
Alice Bob would find a shared key with
all the other people that he might want
to communicate with and Colleen needs to
find a shared key with the remaining
people and so forth and you would have a
key between every pair of people and so
whoever wants to communicate well if
it's between Colleen and Edgar they
would have a shared key that they've
previously established to communicate so
this might work for a small number of
people if we have a large number of
people this gets to be ridiculously
expensive so we'll have a short warm-up
quiz to see how expensive so the
question is how many keys would we need
if there was a group of a hundred people
and any pair of them should be able to
communicate secretly with each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
