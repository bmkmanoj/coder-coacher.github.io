senior mechanical engineer at Mayfield
robotics for my undergrad I went to MIT
for mechanical engineering and for my
Master's I went to USC and product
development
so before Mayfield robotics I was at
another robotics company for about four
years and in Silicon Valley terms that
means that it's time for me to go and I
ancient so I started looking for no
passively for opportunities and Mike the
CEO at me field robotics he approached
me at a friend's house when we were
there watching a Silicon Valley marathon
which is very fitting and he told me
about the opportunity at Mayfield he
said that he really needed a mechanical
engineer to help him build an adorable
home robot and I asked him what does it
do and he said I all I can do is it
probably might be something to do with
cats and I was like good enough and then
so within a few days I came in and
interviewed the next day I received an
offer I gave my two weeks notice the
next day and in two weeks I was that
makes those robotics the whole
opportunity to work on a home robot is
extremely unique in our field most
robots are more industrial or for
scientific purposes so being able to
work on a consumer-level robot is a
pretty fun and exciting opportunity
the uniqueness the challenges that are
involved with the home I had some
experience with that in my previous
company which was developing a
telepresence robot for the home as well
so I had some knowledge that transferred
from there but also just the idea that
this robot specifically would have a
personality which is something very
unique we've started trying to develop
that in robotics a lot you have started
to seeing a lot of robots especially
geared towards consumers that tend to
have personalities and characteristics
that are supposed to be very endearing
and helpful as opposed to being
threatening and being able to start
exploring that area especially in a
small robotic startup that were you
would be able to have a decent amount of
say and be able to contribute
Lott was a very exciting opportunity I
would say that many of the robots that I
have worked on in the past they were not
supposed to have personalities
telepresence robots they're supposed to
translate the personality of the user
who's driving them they themselves are
supposed to be blank slates so curry who
is supposed to have a very distinct
personality was a complete change from
that original project that I worked on
so it was very attractive to me in that
sense in that it was a totally different
challenge how do you convey emotions how
do you convey a sense of warmth or
attachment to and what is essentially an
object that's something that's very
different that I thought was very unique
I do so many different things that's
kind of what makes working at Mayfield
so exciting is because day to day
sometimes I honestly don't know what I'm
going to be working on I'll walk into
the office thinking I have I'm going to
be working on this test fixture and I
need to research this thing and then
something completely different will
happen and I end up working on something
totally else but some days I'm working
in the hardware lab Sundays I'm talking
with vendors and our Factory in China
some days I'm just coordinating a lot of
people sometimes I'm just sitting in
front of my computer for hours doing CAD
yeah it can vary a lot from day to day I
basically own the entire mechanical
Hardware of the robot except for certain
elements within it so integrating all
the electrical systems all of the
mechanisms that go into the remote geez
so how curry conveys her emotions the
drivetrain is on a high level my
responsibility as well as all of the
cosmetic skins and the packaging the
first week like like a vegetable for was
a lot of paperwork but also basically on
day two after I was all settled in and I
was sitting at my desk and two of the
engineers like okay stuff we need you
basically to design the drivetrain for
the robot
we don't really know what kind of
drivetrain we want but we have an idea
we did this hackathon two weeks ago when
you weren't here so here's all those
drive trains that we built from it and
have that and let us know what you come
up with and I was like okay do we have
any equipment here do we have any tools
here and they're like no not really but
you could probably use this other groups
labs and I was like okay so basically it
was hit the ground running immediately
and within a week we had my first
drivetrain up and running I had to get
myself set up on saw works and and
whatnot and yeah it was off to the races
after that it is a very unique challenge
and at the time the product itself was
still somewhat amorphous like how were
we going to go about solving technically
some of the challenges with moving
around the home when you read a lot of
child wrecks out there you realize that
these people are shopping for unicorns
and you feel sorry for them because
they're not going to they're just going
to be disappointed but yeah so but a
note for me I would say that when I look
for jobs in the past what I've done is I
will see like alright I hit probably 75
80 % and hopefully if I explain in a
good cover letter in a nice way why or
what else I could bring that may be in
addition to the job wreck that that
might maybe make up for some of the
areas where I'm a bit weaker most often
when we are looking for candidates it's
with the understanding that we will
probably not find someone with
everything I would say in the hardware
team there's about 10 to 12 people right
now but we also have a lot of
contractors and a lot of consultants so
technically my title by title I am the
only mechanical engineer but I actually
work with a large number of other
mickey's who are current contractors or
consultants usually I coordinate with
the contractors and consultants I'm
currently working with I think four
different consulting companies for
now as the main point of contact and so
I have to coordinate all those like one
one Consulting Group is working on the
drivetrain another is working on the
head
another is working on the packaging and
so being able to coordinate all those
into a single cohesive product is a
pretty big part of my job so my job
includes quite a lot of things there's
the mechanical design and CAD aspect but
there's also test fixtures writing up
test procedures coordinating employees
and consultants and contractors on
various projects helping to come up with
assembly procedures and lots of under
management and coordinating with their
contract manufacturer in China those are
all big parts of my job so lots of
technical and soft skills involved oh I
don't know I'm the best person to ask
because I don't think I've overcome that
but in a lot of respects like sometimes
I look back and I'm like did I actually
do those things would that be and then
but then I kind of sit down and I think
yeah yeah I wasn't me
a lot of it like especially with a lot
of my past projects and achievements
that workgroup focus sometimes it's hard
to remember how much your individual
contribution helped toward that project
and so you think about like these are
the things that I did to help make this
product that made this project work that
is something that has helped me in path
so in terms of tools that I use software
wise I use quite a lot of SolidWorks
that's what our main CAD package is and
then tools lots of hand tools we have a
laser cutter here three 3d printers lots
of hand tools we have a middle lays saws
and drilled you know that's the normal
things that you find in a hardware lab
for someone who's first starting out and
oh sorry sorry I haven't yeah for
someone who's first starting out and is
trying to find a job in the robotics
industry I would say don't be
intimidated a lot of robotics jobs
they're looking for people
who have skills in lots of
cross-functional areas and they're there
or they're looking for people who have
really deep experience but even if
you're just starting out I would still
apply
I would still tell them like one of the
things is enthusiasm people really want
to see that you are interested in the
field if you have done any projects on
the side even if it's not work
experience like if you have like a
portfolios you've worked on any side
projects whether that's in school or on
your own time that really helps and also
realize that robotics itself is a very
young industry so to a large degree we
don't actually know what we need so you
know I've met people who have come from
all kinds of different and random walks
of life who have made their way into
their BIOS industries people who before
were like lawyers or cops or yeah so
just very random and who are now working
on a technical level in the products
industry so don't be intimidated if you
feel that you are under qualified or
somehow don't have the experience that
people are looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
