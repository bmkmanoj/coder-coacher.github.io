data with all tricks in this example
we're going to use the text input tool
which is way to input data without
having to bring in a file we can simply
type in data which is commonly done when
we need just a record or two to run a
test or we can paste records in from
Excel or some other source which I'm
going to do here next to parse the data
we're going to connect the text to
columns tool in the configuration window
we point to the field that we want to
parse and then set the delimiter to a
period because as you can see the period
is what is delimiting the components of
the data all tricks will split two
columns by default and in the setting
right here number of columns you can
identify how many fields will be
generated by the parsing we need three
fields one for the word data one for the
first number and one for the second
number we can set the output route name
to a specific word like call for column
and when the data is parsed it will go
into columns with this route name with a
consecutive number added to it when we
run all tricks we will see three fields
generated with the expected data in each
column call one call to and call three
in the second example we see we have an
address field that contains the street
address state and zip code all in one
field however if we want to count the
records in each five-digit zip code it
would be far easier to work with this
data if the address was in one field the
city in a second field and the state in
a third field and the zip code and forth
this can easily be done by parsing the
data using characters notice how the
three components of the address are
separated by commas the street address
the city and the state plus zip code if
we use the comma as a delimiter we can
divide the data into those three
components so let's do that now
we grab the text to columns tool connect
it up identified the field to parse
which is address and then the comma is
the delimiter and we will split that two
three columns address one is the
original address address two is the city
and address three is the state and zip
code next we need to separate out the
state from the zip code this can be done
using the space as the delimiter as you
can see the space is the delimiter
between these two components however we
also want to separate the 5-digit zip
code from the last four digits and you
can see that a dash is delimiting those
to parse those two components within the
address three field we grab another text
to columns tool point to the address
three field and set the delimiter to be
both a space and a dash there are three
columns that we would like to split in
two and they will all start with addr as
a result we can see that the address
three field has been split into its
three component parts and now we can
clean up the data set to get rid of
fields and rename them grab the Select
tool remove the fields that we no longer
need like a dress and address three and
rename the existing fields address city
state zip zip for
the result is the newly parsed data with
the fixed up fields</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
