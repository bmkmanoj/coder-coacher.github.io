activities of doing activity recognition
one I'm thinking of as model-based
action recognition so you have some way
of getting the pose or the appearance of
a human body and you're going to relate
these descriptions of the change of the
pose or appearance to some action labels
and probably build a classifier or
something like that and one of the main
challenges in doing that work is are
your data that you use from training
taken from a different context then the
data where you're doing the actual
recognition these problems tend to be
pretty easy if i have training data from
the place that i actually end the camera
in which i want to do the recognition
and are much more difficult if the
training data come from a different
source model based activity recognition
basically assumes i've got some
low-level process for either detecting
actions maybe probabilistically with
some noise and then what i need to do is
recognize the overall activity by
comparing it to some i put structural
representation of activity something
that defines how the different actions
relate one to the other one of the
reasons I sort of like talking about it
this way is it sometimes reasonable to
get lots of examples with low-level
actions so you can do our traditional
building a classifier to do that but
harder to get lots of examples of the
overall activity there's some change in
that lately in terms of using large data
sets I'll talk about that a little bit
but in some sense those are a somewhat
artificial problem when you do this you
have this problem handling uncertainty
that is your low level detection czar
uncertain and your descriptions very and
you have to be able to recognize the
activity in the presence of this
uncertainty and some of the major
challenges are you know just can you
keep track of which part is which who is
who if you've got multiple things going
on in a train station there's lots of
ambiguity and occlusion and being able
to say what the activity is is sometimes
difficult when you're subject to those
those variations recently there's been
some work where you actually don't do as
much about that you just view activity
as sort of a big space-time pattern of
some sort so you're not actually
tracking bodies or meet you don't
no there are people there you're
basically just describing the overall
pattern of motion and you typically
train a classifier will mention that
just a little bit here but not spend a
lot of time on that also recently and
this was kind of I found it kind of
funny there's been doing activity
recognition from a single image and you
might ask you know how is that possible
how is that possible okay thank you
megan i didn't really wonder saying yes
how is that possible look here's a
picture okay so you see that says
imagine a picture of person holding a
flute well you don't have to imagine
there it is you could say what are they
doing right and you could say they're
playing a flute right playing a flute is
an activity so even though only
recognizing a particular pose in fact
when I go like this you can almost
hallucinate the flute being there right
even though it's not really there and
you can think about whether that's a
vision problem or an AI problem or a
hallucinogenic problem but whatever it
is the idea is that you're recognizing
activity from a single pose and I don't
really think of that as activity
recognition what I think of that is sort
of representative image recognition
right this is this is sort of the
canonical image that you have in your
mind of the pose of a person doing that
activity so you're recognizing the pose
in the context you're not you might even
be recognizing the fruit the fruit the
flute as is here I guess you could play
fruits too i don't know you could
recognize the float and that helps you
see that they're doing flute playing but
to me it's it's kind of a far cry two
call that actually activity recognition
in terms of anything like video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
