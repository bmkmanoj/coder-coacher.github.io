know automate these manual tasks tell
people what's going on automatically
what's next what would air which we
build next so in our flow we have
handled sort of the maintenance side of
things but what about the scheduling
stuff I mean we kind of built that out
but then let it be yeah so scheduling I
imagined would look something like I
know whoever is doing the scheduling for
the band says hey I really like this
band let's schedule oh come on a stage
right and then the stage manager
probably it's all up sex like hey you
and tell me or you know the concert the
festival promoter psyche whoa whoa
what's going on you threes already
playing at that time yeah I can't do
that okay so we need some way to get
these people talking to each other
making sure that nobody's doing anything
crazy right ok so I imagine that would
be the stage manager handling all that
so similar to how we could assign tasks
and things like that to a maintenance
worker we can do that to a stage manager
sounds reasonable and we could do that
like what we're talking about right now
you know approving these book bands at
certain set times using something really
similar to workflow rule called an
approval process okay so this is like
the somebody needs to give a stamp of
approval before it can move on right I
mean it's just like a workflow in the
sense that you have automated actions
but it involves that stamp of approval
and that personal interaction in order
for it to complete the cycle make sense
