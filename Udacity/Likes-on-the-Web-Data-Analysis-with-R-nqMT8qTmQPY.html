answer this question so first I'm going
to create an hour block of code and I'm
going to use the by command I'll pass it
ww likes as the first parameter and then
I'll pass gender as a second since
that's the variable I want to split our
ww likes / I want a total of legs for
each gender so I'm going to use the sum
function here running this code we can
see our output the likes for males is 1
million 430,000 a 175 but it's the
females that have way more likes there
are over three and a half million it
looks like females have more than two
times the number of Lex's men and while
this might seem trivial information like
this can help websites or other
businesses decide which features are
used most often by different subgroups
this might help a business our website
decide which features they should
continue to invest in our which ones
they should just leave behind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
