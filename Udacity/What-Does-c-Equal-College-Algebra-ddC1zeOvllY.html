make this equation true we have to
modify both sides of the equation so we
get c by itself on one side of the equal
sign and everything else on the other
side now to ensure that both sides of
the equation actually remain equal to
each other so that we can legally
continue to write equal signs inner
equation whatever we do to one side of
the equation we need to do the other
side as well if these two things start
out having the same value but I for
example add four to the left side and
subtract one from the right side then
they can't possibly equal one another
anymore since I've changed them in
different ways will do plenty of
practice that concept in the coming
lessons for now though let's think about
what's preventing see from being by
itself you know that we want our final
equation to look like C equals blah blah
blah blah blah something so means we
need to isolate see as mathematicians
like to say instead of having just see
though we have 92 times C remember
there's an invisible multiplication sign
right here between our coefficient or
variable we basically need to undo this
multiplication get rid of it and the way
to undo multiplication is to do some
division since right now c is being
multiplied by 92 to have just see on its
own we need to divide by 92 but that
also means since i'm dividing on one
side of the equation that i also need to
divide on the other side so i also need
to divide 598 x 92 looking at the right
side 92 c / 92 is as we wished just see
and on the left side 598 / 92 is equal
to the number six and a half just to be
safe it's always a good idea to check
your answer if you know how to in this
case we can just do substitution
starting with our initial equation 598
equals 90 to see we can plug in our new
value for C and see if this makes a true
equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
