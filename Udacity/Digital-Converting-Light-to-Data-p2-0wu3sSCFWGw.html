of a simple charge-coupled device here
I'm basically showing an animation of
each and every layer of a charge-coupled
device we are going to basically now
peel this back out as an onion and look
at each one of them separately but of
course point is light is coming down
this way and hitting a variety of layers
and then of course it hits the bottom
layer where actually the current is
stored let's again look at this by
peeling the onion layer by layer so the
first layer basically has a little bit
of an optical flavor it's what is
referred to as a micro lens what in
essence it does it captures the light
and directs it towards the light
sensitive areas beneath it so when light
hits these types of things
it focuses it down to the next layer so
then nothing is lost the next layer is
referred to as the hot mirror this is
where some of the simple filtering is
done so in the case of the film we saw
the example of a UV filter well this is
somewhat similar basically it's let's
visible light pass but reflects light in
the invisible spectrum and basically
doesn't and prevents it from hitting the
sensors below so this is a simple sort
of filtering and prevents the
unnecessary light to hit of course
different types of cameras would do
different things so for example if you
wanted to build a UV camera this would
not be filtering out the UV light in
fact would be amplifying it this is
what's referred to as a color filter
remember light has lots of constituent
colors most of the time we tried to
represent them or at least capture them
in RGB format and that's what we're
gonna try to understand how to do here
so in essence the photo diodes that are
below it are actually colorblind they
basically want to capture the intensity
so this is where we kind of start now
looking at and separating out the colors
this is usually referred to as a bear
array and we'll talk about bear arrays
in a bit basically what it does it takes
a color and separate the light into red
green and blue
and once it's squared and red green and
blue it hits the photo diodes that are
below which I then measure the intensity
of it of course this pattern is unique
and knowing this pattern is essential
because it will tell us how to be able
to convert the value from in this case
to greens red in a blue to figure out
world with the value at this point of
the image so as noted these are the
photo diodes this is exactly where the
light energy that now actually is
hitting each one of these has converted
to electrons and carries a strong
negative charge the final layer is the
vel or sometimes referred to as a
depletion layer this is where electrons
are collected and usually there is a
processor that charges the photo diodes
with a positive charge and then of
course all the negative charges
basically are stored and collect it on
this layer so in essence when you're
pressing a shutter what you're doing is
of course opening the shutter and also
giving a charge to this device so that
can it capture all of this stuff in case
of a chemical film all you need to do is
open the shutter and that's when exactly
the storage happens and of course when
the storage happens you move the film
across and this one all of it is stored
captured off and we'll talk about that
in a bit too so in essence we peel this
whole onion and we saw the details of
how light goes all the way and then ends
up as a stored electrical set of values
which are then converted to pixels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
