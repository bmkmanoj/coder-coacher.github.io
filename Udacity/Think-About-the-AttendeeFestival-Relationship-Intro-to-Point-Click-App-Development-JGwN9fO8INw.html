Johnny concert and missing music yeah
and we've got our two festivals Rafah
Palooza and cloudstock yeah I really
like those names you gave me too but can
you see the problem here I mean they
don't have anything to do like this
festival doesn't know anything about the
attendees so there's no way to like
match them right we don't know which
festival either of those people are
going to yeah so we'll need to relate
those two tables okay so how do we how
do we do that how do we think about that
so let's take a look at it on the tablet
to make it a little more clear so start
off by looking at our festival object we
have the festival here that all the
different field names and then we have
individual records like cloud stock and
raffle Palooza right right and the
fields where we our columns and I get
that yep okay so we could also think
about what our attendee object could
look like okay here we have same sort of
thing all of our fields is the columns
and then our records is the rows okay
but if we were trying to relate these
two tables we would need to create a
relationship field on one of them okay
so like can I think of that it's like a
new column think of it as a new column
in the table exactly so what would make
more sense to add a column onto
attendees relating it to festival or to
add a column onto festival relating it
to attendees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
