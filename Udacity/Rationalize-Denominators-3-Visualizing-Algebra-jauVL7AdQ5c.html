effort if you got both of these correct
now this one was tricky since there was
a simplification that you had to do at
the end let's see if you got it let's
start by thinking about what we want our
denominator to be in order to simplify
well want each of these powers to be a
multiple of six so that way they can be
divided by 6 will want the powers of 2 x
and y to be divisible by 6 since that's
our index of the root so we want to
change to the one in 22 to the 6x
squared into X to the 6th and y to the
eighth and a y to the 12th this means we
have to multiply the denominator by the
6 root of 2 to the fifth X to the fourth
and y to the 4th these are the missing
factors we need to increase each of
these powers to these powers we want to
multiply by a form of one so we multiply
our numerator by the same expression as
this denominator next we multiply 4
times this radical to get our new
numerator we simplify our denominator by
writing 2xy squared it's the 6 root of
each of these factors our numerator
can't be simplified since each of these
powers is not divisible by 6 so we just
rewrite 2 to the fifth that's 32 we have
a common factor of 2 in our numerator
and our denominator so we can simplify
this leaves us with our final answer
great work with your factors and
radicals if you got this far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
