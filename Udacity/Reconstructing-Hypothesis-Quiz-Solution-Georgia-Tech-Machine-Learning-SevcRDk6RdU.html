Charles okay so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm gonna look at the
first two examples and the reason I'm
doing that is because I know they both
generate true and so I'm going to look
for variables that are inconsistent so
if I look at x1 for example it's a 1 in
the first case and a 0 in the second
case so it can't be the case that it's
required in order for this to be true
and the same would be true for x3 so I'm
gonna say that neither x1 or x3 matter
by contrast x2 x4 and x5 all have the
same values in both of those cases so we
don't know much about them quite yet but
let's let that seems very well-reasoned
so we know that x1 can't be part of this
formula and x3 can't be a part of this
formula so let's sort of imagine that
they're not there because they don't
really give us any information anymore
beautiful alright so what's left so
what's left is now to make certain that
x2 x4 and x5 are necessary and
particularly necessary with the values
that they have so I guess all I can
really do is see if there's anything
else to eliminate if I were just looking
at the first two I would think that the
answer was not x2 x4 not x5 all right
hang on to not x2 x4 not x5 great so
that's what I currently think it is
based upon what I just saw and that
would be that's consistent with the
first two examples right and so now I
want to make certain it's consistent
with the next three examples this is the
easiest way for me to think about this
anyway so let's see not x2 x4 so that
should be false which it is well they're
all false so let's see not x2 but x4 so
that should be false which it is and
then I do the same thing so wait why
isn't that the answer that can't be the
answer it is the answer you got it huh I
got it right so the thing to notice is
that in in these first two examples we
have x2 as false x4 is true and x5 is
false and that's enough to make it make
the conjunction true but making flipping
any one of those bits is enough to make
it false so what I showed in the in the
remaining examples is that just by
turning this x2 + + x1 leaving
everything else the same we
it similarly if we flip the x4 to a zero
and leave everything else the same we
lose it similarly if we slip f5x five to
one and leave everything else the same
we lose it so that means that each of
these is necessary to make the
conjunction they're all actually in
there that's just what I was thinking so
in other words you gave me some positive
examples to eliminate things that
weren't necessary and then you gave me
negative examples to validate that each
of the variables that I saw so far were
necessary because getting rid of any one
of them gave me the wrong answer exactly
that's it let's even write down those
two steps so the first thing was show
what's irrelevant and how many questions
how many queries might we have needed to
show that well one per variable
well actually we only need two because
what I did is I I used all the relevant
ones I kept the same and all the
irrelevant ones I flipped from one to
the other I just have to show you that
it's still the output is still one even
though they have two different values
well no no when I said and all of them
you know K of them was because I didn't
know that what if all of them were
irrelevant then it would still be too
cuz I can just show you the all zeros
and the all ones oh you're right you're
right you just need oh that's right
all right and then I have to show you
that that each of the remaining
variables is relevant by flipping it and
showing you that the answer is zero and
how many questions that I need to do for
that three yeah three in this case
because there were three variables that
were used in the formula what's the most
it could be well okay because all of
them could be relevant yeah so it's you
know it's kind of interesting that that
in fact the total number of hypotheses
here is 3 to the K because you know you
can see it right off this table that for
each of the variables it's either
positive absent or negated but the
number of questions that a smart teacher
had to ask was more like k plus 2 huh
which is pretty powerful right so a
smart teacher can help me do this in
linear time so what if I were I didn't
have the teacher who could give me these
examples and I always had to ask
that's a good question let's let's do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
