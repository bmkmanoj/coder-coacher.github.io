lesson black box testing is the testing
of the software one will look at it as a
black box as a closed box without
looking inside without looking at the
code and there are several advantages in
using black box testing so let me recap
those advantages some of which we
already mentioned let me also expand on
that a little bit the first advantage of
when I mention is that black box testing
focuses on the domain on the input
domain of the software and as such we
can use it to make sure that we are
actually covering this domain that we
are actually covering the important
behaviors of the software a second
advantage is that black box testing does
not need the code what that means is
that you can perform early test design
so you can start designing and writing
your test cases even before writing your
code so that when the code is ready we
can test it right away and that helps
prevent in a prominent is very typical
in real life software development which
is getting at the end of the project
and having no time to create the tests
in this way we already have the test so
we just have to run them another
advantage is that black box testing can
catch logic defects because it focuses
on a description of what the software
should do and therefore on its logic if
we derive test cases from such
description then we can catch these kind
of problems and finally black box
testing is applicable at all granularity
levels which means that we can use black
box testing in unit testing integration
testing system testing and so on we can
use it at all levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
