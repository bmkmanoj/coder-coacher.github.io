opportunity cost and how can you use it
to make better decisions for your
business as an entrepreneur you're going
to face a ton of decisions and you'll
have to adapt to new situations as they
unfold
what if new opportunities come up what
if things take longer than expected or
maybe things actually go quicker than
you thought
when this happens you need to change
gears and adjust your direction but how
do you know which way to go one way to
figure this out is to evaluate the
opportunity cost of your decisions so
what's opportunity cost opportunity cost
is the loss of potential gain from other
alternatives when one alternative is
chosen in other words every decision you
make has a potential gain associated
with it and any time you choose one
option
you're missing out on the potential
gains of a different option it's up to
you to compare each decision and
determine which one has the most
potential gain this will minimize the
opportunity cost of the direction you
take here's a few questions you can ask
yourself to help evaluate your
opportunity cost is there something I
could be doing right now that would be a
better use of my time is there any way I
could be managing my resources better
and how could I put myself on my team in
a position to make the best use of their
skills
anytime that you're not doing these
things as effectively as you could be
your actions have some opportunity costs
associated with them there are more
specific values you can start to place
on these numbers but getting this basic
mindset is a great place to start moving
forward
try to think what else could I be doing
right now is there away my time money or
resources could be better spent from
there you can start weighing the
opportunity cost of each decision you
make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
