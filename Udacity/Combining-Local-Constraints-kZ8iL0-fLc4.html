particular gradient that gives us a line
that's what this red one shows us but
suppose we have another gradient okay
but in the same little window
well that gradient would give us a
different line so here's our this is
gradient one this is gradient two
although in the same window and then
here's gradient three and it gives us a
different line clearly what's going on
is if I have a bunch of these different
gradients they're all going to intersect
at the point that point is the correct
UV so as long as we have different
gradients within the window we can get a
solution we've seen this before haven't
we here is the equation we just showed
you a transpose a times Z equals
negative a transpose B alright when can
that be solved to just solve this we
would want a transpose a to be
invertible right cuz if it's invertible
i just multiply both sides by that and i
come up with a solution for D ok well
when are matrices invertible well
they're in from our linear algebra we
know that they need to be what's called
well-conditioned if they're not well
conditioned then the inverse is unstable
and basically you can look at the
eigenvalues all right and the ratio of
the largest eigenvalue to the smog is
the smallest eigenvalue shouldn't be too
big that's from your conditioning in
fact if the second eigenvalue were 0 L 1
over L lambda 1 over lambda 2 would be
infinity that'd be awful all right so
what we want our eigen values that are
you know approximately the same
magnitude okay so that will make it
solvable but wait we also know when this
should be solvable from the geometric
demonstration we just did this whole
problem should be solvable as long as
there are different gradients within the
window because if there are different
gradients within the window then we get
those intersections of those lines in UV
space so does this remind you of
something gradients and eigenvalues of
course it does because you're like right
on the ball all right
you remember our harris corner detector
this matrix a transpose a that is
the second moment matrix of the Harris
detector and if you remember we looked
at the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of
that matrix to know whether or not
something was a good corner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
