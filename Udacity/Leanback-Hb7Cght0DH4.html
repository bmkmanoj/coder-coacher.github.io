widgets that are specially designed to
help you create an android TV app
particularly but not exclusively one
that's designed to browse and play media
this UI that you see here was created
entirely with lean back all we have to
do is provide the assets like images and
instruct lean back how we want them laid
out we also get all of this smooth
animation for free let's talk briefly
about the principal widgets everything
on the screen that you see here is the
Browse fragment it provides our basic
layout on the left you can see a bunch
of column headers and on the right you
can see rows conceptually in
behind-the-scenes the Browse fragment is
composed of a headers fragment on the
left and a rows fragment on the right
this is only important to know because
the headers fragment can be hidden if
you like and of course each header is
tied to its own individual row beyond
layout browse fragment does way more for
us behind the scenes and it actually
contains the code for all these
animations as well as for very efficient
display of large lists and media items
this is a card and cards are a very
important part of the Leanback library a
card constitutes a small view in a media
browser application you might use cards
like this to display songs or movies if
we select a card we'll see the details
fragment it's useful for you guessed it
showing more details about a card in
addition to details about a card the
details fragment contains actions like
watching a trailer or buying or renting
a movie and if you scroll down you'll
see a row of related videos if we decide
to watch a trailer we'll see the
playback overlay fragment not
surprisingly this provides controls for
playing back media let's try it out
you'll notice that after about five
seconds the UI will fade away so the
content is front and center in addition
to playback controls you can add custom
buttons to the overlay fragment for
instance to like' or dislike' media the
basic strategy for building an app with
Leanback is to wrap your media library
so it can be displayed as a series of
headers and cards on the browse fragment
we'll see how this works in code in the
next lesson but first let's see how it
works by design Leanback follows the
model-view-presenter design pattern and
if you're not familiar with them a
design pattern is just a high-level way
of describing how code is structured
there are three pieces to start and the
good news is that they pretty much all
just sit there by that I mean they don't
take any actions on their own first we
have a model a model is just a fancy
word for a database or a content
provider or however you've decided to
organize and store your data in this
case let's say we have a database of
movies each individual movie in the
database might have a text field for the
title and a bitmap for the box artwork
you can see a single movie here
displayed on this view and a view is
just a regular Android view that's used
to display some data here let's say
we're using an image card view that's
included with lean back on your UI you'd
create one of these views for each movie
you'd like to display now a presenters
job is to take an item from the model
say movie and map it to the view
basically all the presenter does is say
the title should go here and the box
artwork should go here simple right
now as I said at runtime all these
pieces just hang out there orchestrated
by another class called an object
adapter an object adapter has two jobs
one it collects item from the model and
two it creates a view for each item in
order to create that view it uses the
presenter in our application code we
create an object adapter and give it a
presenter in its constructor next we add
items from a model to the object adapter
that we'd like to be displayed at
runtime Leanback uses our object adapter
to create views for our items on its
fragments in the next lesson we'll see
how these concepts working code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
