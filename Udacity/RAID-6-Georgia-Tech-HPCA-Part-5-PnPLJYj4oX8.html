there is a tree but we didn't see it
four and five is there such a thing as
rate six yes there is it's similar to
rate five except that each group of
blocks instead of getting one parity
block gets to let's call them parity
quoted blocks they have different types
of parity and as a result rate six can
work when there are two failed stripes
per group note that we cannot do this
with to parity blocks one of the blocks
that we keep extra one of the non data
blocks is going to be the real parity
block and that's what fixes one error
the second of the two blocks is a
different type of check blocks and when
only one disk has failed we use the
parity to recover but when two disks
have failed we can still solve some
equations where the data and the two
types of check blocks figure so that we
can still recover the content of the two
failed disks so let's compare 8 5 + r 8
6 r 8 6 has twice the overhead of raid 5
so we pay twice as much for the increase
reliability there is more right overhead
because really now when we update a data
block we need to read and write the data
block and both of the check blocks the
parity and the second one are also read
and written so there are now 6 accesses
per write vs. 4 per write that we had
with raid 5 so the only reason for
having rate 6 if there is a good chance
of when a disk fails another one failing
before we managed to replace the first
fail Drive so note that in any of the
raid configurations once your disk fails
you don't keep going and ignore the
failed drive you keep going but you
order a replacement or get a replacement
and install it so that the raid array
can re-establish itself after that you
can lose another disk so really rate 6
with its ability to lose 2 disks only
helps
if when a disk fails there is a good
chance of another failing before the
first one is replaced the faster we
replace the first Drive the less chance
there is that another disk fails during
that period of time remember that the
probability of a disk failing during an
hour is extremely low so even if we
spend something like three days
replacing a disk the probability of a
disk failing in that specific time while
we are vulnerable is very very low and
then it seems that rate six is an
overkill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
