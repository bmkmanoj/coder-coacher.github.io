generalization it helps to think about
states as actually being collections of
features instead of just unanalyzed
blobs hmmm so we're no longer refer to
States is state 17 and state 19 we can
but I think it's helpful actually to
give them additional information like
these features so here's a concrete
example to make this try to make some
sense remember our taxi problem that we
talked about before however good in this
particular environment there was
something like I don't know 500 states
and in standard q-learning type
approaches we would just think of all
those different states is being
completely different from one another
but we can also imagine tagging each of
the states with some particular value
like whether or not well we didn't
really have fuel when we talked about it
but whether we're low on fuel what is
the x-coordinate of the the taxi cab
this thing here what's the y-coordinate
of the taxi cab is the taxicab currently
near a wall say to the you know some
direction north south east west each of
these different features give us a
little bit of a handle on on the states
and how they relate to each other right
so if we have this state that we've got
right here and we say move the passenger
to some other position we're still in a
related state you know the taxi hasn't
moved it would be nice to be able to
capture that and so this notion of
features gives us that idea that make
sense so that's a lot like how we talked
about a machine learning and supervised
learning in our other machine learning
class exactly oh yeah in fact what we
had words for these things we talked
about the boy what were those words it's
the sort of the notion that different
machine learning representations cause
different things to be similar to each
other right and there are lots of
different ways that we could represent
the state space other than whatever the
different 500 states are you have some
of them up here but we could have the
coordinates of the of where the
passenger is not just the coordinates of
where the taxi is we could have things
represented in sort of an egocentric way
of what's the I don't know Manhattan
distance between a passenger and where
the passenger wants to end up we could
they're all kinds of things that we
could we could the ways we could
describe things and some of those things
make some states look more similar than
other representations what I think I
remembered the term I think it was
inducted
bias inductive bias was something that
referred to the way algorithms preferred
one solution over another oh but I think
you're right though because different
features sort of create different kind
of inductive biases by making some
states look more similar so for example
if we had this egocentric notion of how
far away you know a person is from a
taxi then so long as a person is say two
steps away from the taxi any state where
a person is two steps away from a taxi
looks the same or it looks very similar
in fact if you look at this one you have
now so you just drew that right the red
circle is close to the orange square if
you were to move both the red circle and
the orange square up those two states
would still be very similar because
there's still two away from one another
or have two in between them but even
though I don't move the red circle if I
take the orange square and move it to
the right then that's less similar
because they're farther apart hmm okay
and though we're ignoring walls the way
you describe that right right I'm
ignoring walls we move both of these up
by to wear so yeah we're two apart but
it does feel kind of different because
we have to go around the walls and if
it's different or not different depends
upon the state features that you use
okay do we have a name for that or is
inductive bias and okay stand in it's a
representation right it's a
representation if some representations
are better for some things than others
and and you can learn differently
depending upon what features you choose
okay for example here's a great feature
for every state here's the set of
actions you should take to accomplish
the goal that's one representation that
makes learning really easy ah yes good
point so let's talk about what we're
actually going to learn okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
