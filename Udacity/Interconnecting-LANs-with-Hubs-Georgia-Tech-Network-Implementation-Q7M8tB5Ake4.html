connected is with something called a hub
hubs are the simplest form of
interconnection and in some sense they
don't even exist in networks anymore
today because you can build a switch for
essentially the same price but for the
sake of example let's just take a look
at how a LAN would be connected with the
hub now a hub essentially creates a
broadcast medium among all of the
connected hosts where all packets on the
network are seen everywhere so if a
particular host sends a frame that's
destined for some other host on the LAN
then a hub will simply broadcast that
frame that it receives on an incoming
port out every outgoing port so all
packets are seen everywhere there is a
lot of flooding and there are many
chances for collision the chance of
collision of course introduces
additional latency in the network
because collisions require other hosts
or senders to back off and not send as
soon as they see other senders trying to
send at the same time lands that are
connected with hubs are also vulnerable
to failures or miss configuration
because even one misconfigured device
can cause problems for every other
device on the land suppose that you had
a misconfigured device that was sending
a lot of rogue or unwanted traffic well
on a network that's connected with hubs
every other host on the network would
see that unwanted traffic so we need a
way to improve on this broadcast medium
by imposing some amount of isolation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
