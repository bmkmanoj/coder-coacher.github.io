problems he wants to know if you can
give more explanation on tips and
techniques and tricks to help students
solve them before the final help them
prepare so this is a tough question and
there's no magic way that i can give you
that's going to really solve this that
the way to learn to solve challenges
like this is really to practice and to
solve increasingly difficult ones doing
cryptography depends on persistence in a
lot of cases it also depends on
creativity and being open-minded and
often people think a challenge is going
to be really hard so they don't try the
easy things so definitely to make sure
that you understand what the challenge
is asking for and think about the easy
things first before assuming that you
have to try something really complicated
and it's also a big difficulty as
deciding are you on the right path and
should you keep trying that or are you
stuck in a rut and you need to try
something different and this is one of
the things that makes cryptography hard
the challenge in this class are all
contrived challenges that they are
intended to give you a sense of what it
would be like to break a cryptosystem
that's not contrived to be breakable but
that's a little different and that means
there's it's a challenge for us to
construct ones that are good I know
there was a lot of grumbling about the
challenge in homework 2 that many people
spent a lot of effort on it trying to do
complicated things to break it and
learning about random number generation
and the different ways to do that and I
hope you found that worthwhile and got
something out of it it turned out the
actual sequence was quite easy to break
if you looked at it in the right way it
was not intended to be quite as easy as
it was and I apologize for some of the
obvious braixen obvious falls in it I
won't say specifically what they are now
because I know some people still want to
try the challenge on their own but that
was a mistake on my part on it and I'm
sorry that it turned out to be as
trivial once you looked at in the right
way as it was but it was intended to be
something where you could break it
without doing a lot of research into
other types of random number of
generation schemes that wasn't the
intent of the question the intent was if
you looked at at different ways looking
at the bit patterns looking for any kind
of patterns in the sequence that would
be what you need to break it and we will
have some
sting challenge questions for homework
for that will scale up the levels of
difficulty so I think one of the things
to get better at solving challenges is
to have the practice of solving ones you
build your confidence as you solve
easier challenges and move on to harder
ones so what the challenge for Homer for
will be there'll be some that we give me
some pretty good hints about how to
solve and we think we'll still be hard
and involve an interesting challenge to
solve them and there are others that
we're not going to tell you about what
to solve and we're not going to tell you
which ones are the easy ones which ones
are the hard ones so this is going to
give you a different kind of experience
solving a challenge I hope people enjoy
it and get something out of it
definitely be able to attack it the
first step is to understand the
underlying crypto behind it and that
hopefully will come out of the lecture
and solving the other problems but the
short answer really on getting a little
bit ramlan because I don't have a good
answer that says if you do XY and z all
of a sudden challenge problems will get
easy and you'll be able to break all
these young crypto systems that it
really takes practice it also takes sort
of having an open mind and thinking
about different things to try and
creativity but the way to learn is to
practice and try to solve increasingly
hard challenge problems the other thing
that is really the way to learn is to
work with other people if you can do
that with someone in person who's
experienced at solving the kinds of
problems that's really the best way to
have that kind of back and forth if you
can do that on the forums that also is
great and so the challenge problems that
have worked well we've seen you know a
discussion in the forum where people
suggested the different approach they've
tried other people might add to those or
suggest an alternative those are the
things that will really help you develop
in terms of solving problems like this
having that kind of discussion and
learning about approaches other people
take but still putting the work in to
try to think of ways to solve it
yourself so I hope you'll enjoy the
future challenge problems and they will
give you a good sense and build your
confidence at solving them I realize
that it can be frustrating and that's
part of the difficulty is if you knew
you were on the right path in making
progress every step well that we great
but that's not usually the way things
work in cryptography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
