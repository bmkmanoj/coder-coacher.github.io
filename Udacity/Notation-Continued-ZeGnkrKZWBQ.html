the basics there are a lot of
complications that we're going to
address now first of all in the previous
example we should think about the for
loop does the for loop itself count for
something
in order for the loop to work you need
to do a computation each time to get the
next letter in the string
since this needs to happen one time for
every input letter we can just add one
to the value before N and now we end up
with 3n plus 2 it turns out that it's
actually really hard to predict how many
computations this pseudocode is going to
take for example a lower level language
like C would break down the process a
lot more and it would take a lot more
lines of code but they would be doing
less work in the background the Python
version of this might be about this many
lines of code but it would be doing a
lot more in the background because it's
a higher-level language for example
let's look at this line this line could
take a different number of computations
based on the data structure the cipher
is using maybe we store a data and a
list and we need to check each letter
against our current letter to solve the
code that could be as many as 26 checks
for each letter in our input string so
ultimately our efficiency calculation
might look a little more like this
let's go back to those example input
strings we talked about before now if we
start out with a 10 letter input string
we end up with 292 computations if we
start out with 1 million letters in our
input string we end up with 29 million
steps to go through because of our
choice of data structure we're doing a
lot more computations than we might if
we chose it a little bit smarter later
we'll talk a little bit more about the
efficiency of different types of data
structures but for now hopefully you
realize the importance of thinking about
efficiency before writing code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
