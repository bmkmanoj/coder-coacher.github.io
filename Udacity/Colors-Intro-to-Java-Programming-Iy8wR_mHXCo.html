in black now black is a marvelous color
but what if you'd like another one such
as one of these these colors have
predefined names and when you look here
you can see that every color is a
mixture of a red green and blue
component red has only red and no green
and blue blue has only blue and no red
and green yellow has a red and green had
no blue you can make other mixtures and
you will explore that in the exercises
that are going to be coming up right now
let's just stick with right let's say we
have a rectangle that we want to draw in
red you set the color to the color
constant red in this way and then when
you draw it it shows up in red
alternatively you can call the fill
method and then the interior is also
drawn in red now you know everything
about the graphics library that you need
to make fancy drawings on your own go
ahead and do the practice assignments
with Sarah and when you're done maybe
you'll be motivated to recreate Udacity
train or create a fancy drawing of your
own and share it with us on the
discussion group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
