phenotypes but I can't really keep
straight which alleles cause which
phenotypes that's a really good point
and there's actually a good solution for
two we can actually symbolize which
allele causes which phenotype for
example we can symbolize lactase
persistence with the plus sign or the
positive sign here and lactase non
persistence with the minus sign or the
negative sign this means that the t
allele would be associated with the plus
symbol and the C allele would be
associated with the minus symbol so if
we rewrite all of our allelic
combinations that are possible we'll
remember that there are three
possibilities TTT c or CC and now that
means we can have plus plus plus minus
and minus minus this gives us a far more
functional looking symbol that tells us
maybe a little bit about the phenotype
rather than just the letter itself which
can be hard to remember which phenotype
its associated with ok so that's a lot
easier to follow now well notice it in
the case of lactose intolerance all you
need is one allele of lactase
persistence so that you can actually
digest lactose in the first place with
you but how is that possible well
remember because all you need is some
lactase protein around the digest
lactose at all having one allele the t
allele will give you enough lactase
protein at all to be able to digest
lactose let's think about it like we did
in our recipe analogy from lessons three
and four ok ok and with you alright what
we're going to do this time is instead
of using lots of different ingredients
we're going to use an ingredient cheese
now I see so we have one gene but two
types of alleles we have the cheddar
allele in the mozzarella allele exactly
just like in a gene we have two copies
of the alleles for that gene so Lauren
what are the possible allelic
combinations here well we can have to
cheddars right which would be our two T
alleles or we can have two mozzarellas
right which would represent our to see
alleles or we can have one mozzarella
and one cheddar right this would be the
heterozygous condition where we have
both a tle oh and the C allele so really
the important question now is in this
heterozygous condition which flavor are
we going to taste
well I think you taste a cheddar flavor
because that's going to overpower the
mozzarella flavor because it's just a
stronger flavor exactly this allele is
going to be dominant and so this flavor
is actually going to overpower the
flavor of the mozzarella which means
that you're going to need to mozzarellas
to be able to taste the flavor of the
mozzarella right exactly now think about
all the genotypes and phenotypes
surrounding the trait of lactase
persistence I want you to match each
genotype to the expected phenotype here
so for each genotype that you see select
whether or not you think it will be
lactose tolerant or lactose intolerant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
