recursively generated graphs we start
off with a set of n nodes and we create
a graph on half of the nodes recursively
we create a graph on the other half of
the nodes recursively then we generate
some edges that connect up between these
two smaller graphs and that's the graph
that we returned so we can get a bunch
of different mechanisms for generating
recursive graphs with this basic
structure depending on how we create the
first sub graph how we create the second
sub graph and how we connect the two sub
graphs together so let's start off with
a really simple example so here's some
pseudo Python for generating a craft
with n nodes what it's going to do is to
make a graph with n nodes if and is just
1 it returns a single node all by itself
but if it's not we're gonna assume it's
some other power of 2 we make a graph
with n over 2 nodes call it G 1 we make
another graph and over 2 nodes
call it G 2 then we pick a random node
from g1 call it AI 1 a random node from
G to call it AI 2 and we link them
together so at a high level we create
graph G 1 create graph G 2 we pick a
random node i 1 pick another random node
I 2 and we link them together now in
this picture it's not really clear
what's going on inside of these what I'd
like you to do is figure it out so maybe
take and just be some small power of 2
like 4 or 8 and trace through this
pseudocode to try to figure out what
kind of graph pops out so here's 3
choices to choose from what we get out
is it a tree is it a chain or is it a
ring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
