call this logical address process so we
always talk about physical addresses
those are addresses that point to
locations in physical memory locations
and address space are logical it's a
logical or virtual address because it's
going to map to ok so this mapping that
we're talking about here it's going to
map to some physical memory location
eventually everything has to be stored
in physical memory so we can say logical
address 2000 in process one's address
space currently lives in physical
location 5,000 or something like that so
process the address space that we're
talking about and the address is that
make up that address space 0 through I
said 2 to the N minus 1 and is 32 or 64
these are called logical addresses this
is in these logical addresses or the
logical space that we define for a
process the process is going to put its
code and it's going to put its data so
when we talk about an address space as
you note of isolation such as you start
with this process has its own container
of memory where it can address different
parts of it in particular different
locations where it's going to place its
code and data and these are logical or
in case of virtual memory virtual
addresses eventually remember the
operating system has to use physical
resources to implement these
abstractions or virtual resources well
address space is a virtual resource that
abstracts memory so this address space
or whatever that we have here the
information that we stored in this
address space eventually we have to use
physical memory that's RAM or physical
memory to actually implement this
abstraction we call an address space so
you generate the logical address you say
I want to access logical location as I
said 2,000 we have to save all that
currently lives somewhere in this
physical memory that we have here so
this code and data eventually has to be
placed in different places in the memory
that we we have
this address space has to be backed up
or physically has to be supported with
the physical memory that we have and
this physical memory could there could
be multiple processes having their
address spaces current concurrently
being or existing in this physical
memory that we have so one of the things
isolation we're talking about is that
you know if I'm giving you some physical
memory for your address space and you
process a and I give some physical
memory to another process B and it then
uses that memory to to store some of its
stuff from its address space I have to
to isolate the to address spaces I
actually have to isolate what physical
memory can process a axis versus what
physical memory can process B axis so
this is the operating system has to do
that I think isolation the way to think
about this is when process a is running
its address spaces in some parts of this
physical memory it should only be able
to go to those parts and process
baserunning it should be able to go to
only those parts that are currently
allocated to it and they never run into
each other unless you choose to share
which is always sort of an exception so
when you talk about isolation think of
an address space that's what a process
thinks it has implementing that address
space by storing pieces of in different
parts of memory and then making sure
that a process can only go to physical
memory that it belongs to it and that's
how we get this isolation so one of the
things we want to do is how exactly does
it work so to get some sense of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
