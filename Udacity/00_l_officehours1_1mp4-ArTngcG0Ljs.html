this problem from homework to about
whether this loop would ever terminate
and in particular the third one where
knowing whether or not the loop would
terminate depended on the co-op's
conjecture Lissa's which is an open
mathematical problem and this was
definitely a hard question to try to
make sense out of based on what we've
seen just in the class but my hope was
that that question would get you
thinking about several important things
in computer science and I think it did
from the discussions it may have got you
thinking about them in a more
frustrating way than I would have hoped
and I'm sorry for people who found this
very frustrating but there's some
important lessons of draw from that and
the first one is that you can never make
a conclusion about how a program will
behave in all cases just based on
experiments any interesting program has
an infinite number of inputs like that
loop where there are infinitely many
different numbers and you can't try it
for all the integers because there's
definitely many of them you can do
experiments running it for a bunch of
them see that it always seems to stop
the lube always finishes for all the
ones you try but that's not enough to
know that it always finishes for all
inputs that's a very different claim
than what you can show by any experiment
the other point that I hope that
question made and I hope without too
much frustration but it but understand
especially if you didn't find the hint
that this was a very hard thing to
figure out what to do with was that
reasoning about code and especially
reasoning about properties that depend
on following pass through code is very
difficult and it's not just difficult
it's been proven that it's impossible in
general that there's no way in general
to take some code and answer this
question of whether that code always
finishes for some code there is a way to
answer that question and that was the
case for the other two parts of that
question for the third one even though
it looked like fairly simple code and
didn't use anything that we haven't seen
in class so far that you couldn't
understand from the class even for that
simple code determining whether or not
that code would terminate on some input
is equivalent to solving some know an
open mathematical problem that no one
knows the answer to there are other
cases where we can actually prove that
it's impossible to determine in general
whether
some code has some property or not and
those are things we're not going to get
into too deeply in this class there are
things that I am glad that you're
starting to think about and we will
continue to encounter them and then I
hope you'll be asking these questions
and disturbed enough by these questions
that you'll want to take a theory class
later that will really get into the
reason behind this and understand the
theory of what kinds of things computers
can solve in the things that they
canceled so that was the intent of that
question and I'm sorry people found it
frustrating but I hope you also learned
a lot from that and started to think
about problems the way computer
scientists think about problems by doing
that and I think we do have some have
some honor at ham so purple wants oh hi
so our connection with the half has been
a little flaky so hopefully that we
won't lose it again but welcome hi did
you have a question at first if you
would like to introduce yourself and
tell us where you're from my name is
Michelle crying upstate New York hi
Michelle must be pretty light there it
is it's about my bedtime um but I'm just
actually starting today with the course
outside Lake down a little okay well
welcome it's not too late to get started
thank you so I don't really have any
questions I just kind of wanted to see
what was going on and try the hang up
okay ah well well we're trying to hang
out too yeah in experiment and we'll
hopefully things will work it seems to
crash every time there's more than about
three or four people that join so we'll
see if it works better this time we are
in palo alto california okay and more
people came to more people here while
we're waiting I guess that's we can go
to another question from okay on the Fox
I got you on it hope we lost loot
alright so back to the forums we talked
about the Collatz conjecture everyone
had fun with that
a lot of these are suggestions okay um
well we could discuss some of the
suggestions / homework Martian about the
Collette's couch okay I think there's
almost an infinite lost conjecture
wanting live office Harris well that's
what trying yeah I got a google hangout
could work um else do we have the python
reference do you know what the status hi
so there's a python reference postage
for each unit there was a bit of a delay
getting that posted for unit 2 but there
are Python references posted for both
unit 2 and unit 3 now and they include
everything that's been covered in the
class up to and including that unit said
the you everyone includes one two and
three where do we find where do you find
them I believe they are in the
supplemental materials yes that correct
hello video and the unit click on the
supplemental materials done and you will
see notes course notes for the vet
section and also there's links to the
reference materials relating
specifically python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
