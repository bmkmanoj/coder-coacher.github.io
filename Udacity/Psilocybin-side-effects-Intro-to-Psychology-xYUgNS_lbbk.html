negative effects with people using
psilocybin could you touch on perhaps
some unusual experiences yes so it's
very important to understand that there
are risks very real risks associated
with exposure to psilocybin so in our
studies at Johns Hopkins in in a
therapeutic context and when we are
doing studies and healthy volunteers we
very carefully screen our volunteers we
develop rapport with them the drug is
given under very tightly supervised in
supportive context and we do aftercare
with them
why do we do this so the reason that we
do this is because unfortunately
psilocybin can produce some some very
difficult long lasting and potentially
harmful effects so number one is that
under the influence of psilocybin people
can have panic or fear reactions and
they can end up engaging in dangerous
behavior and it's uncommon but it's not
unheard of to read reports where people
run out into traffic jump out of windows
you know flee in ways that get
themselves or other people into trouble
- is that there's there really is
concern and this is more serious than
just the panic it really is concerned
that in some individuals exposure to
psilocybin and other compounds of this
certain urges loosening class can
precipitate in during psychiatric
illness
the worst possible case would be
precipitation of psychosis or
schizophrenia you know in someone who's
already vulnerable to that disorder and
that that's a lifelong irreversible
disorder that is is disastrous for
someone other than that there are some
people who report persisting ptsd-like
syndrome
depression and anxiety disorders so
we're very concerned about that and and
it's one of the reasons we screen people
very carefully and support them through
these kinds of experiences we just
recently have conducted and are
continuing to collect data on an online
survey asking people about the most
difficult experiences that had with
psilocybin and what we're finding is
that most people are reporting
experiences when when it's isolated to
their most difficult experience they're
reporting experiences that are among the
most difficult that they've ever had in
their lives and very often the single
most challenging experience so there's
nothing easy about these experiences but
the the more sobering statistics out of
this survey is that anywhere from about
3% to 10% of people are reporting
persisting effects that look like some
kind of like persisting psychological
harmful consequence so some of these
people never have been in therapy before
and have sought out psychological
counseling for for fearful reactions or
anxiety disorders or paranoia after the
session with psilocybin that and they
attribute their seeking that out to the
psilocybin session about 6% of people
report a decreased sense of well-being
and and so while these compounds may
have great therapeutic potentials there
are also significant risks right right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
