we're used to well the truth is this
data is JSON it's just jason and its raw
white form that's what all these hex
numbers are in order to actually
understand and use it we'll need to
convert it from raw JSON into an object
we can use in Swift and guess what Swift
has just the class for us it's called NS
Jason serialization and it allows us to
convert Jason into objects like a raise
or dictionaries and vice versa since we
want to go from json data to an object
will use a method called JSON object
with data this takes in our raw JSON
data and returns either an nsdictionary
or an NS array which are both usable and
Swift ok let's go use it in our code we
can start back in this little spot where
we're printing the raw data now instead
of printing it let's convert it we
should start by using optional binding
to get our data out of optional form and
make sure that it exists then let's
create an object that will eventually
contain our parts dictionary result we
can call it parsed result and now let's
add in that method NS Jason
serialization dot JSON object with data
with data as our first parameter and
allow fragments as the second parameter
and save that result to our parsed
result oh what's this can call throw but
is not marked with try and the error is
not handled hmm it looks like this
method can throw an error let's use
swift's do catch block and the try
keyword to handle it if you haven't seen
this error handling syntax before or
would like a refresher feel free to
check out the Swift syntax course but
overall this will be pretty
straightforward let's add the do catch
block like so and then put in the tri
keyword in front of the potentially
problematic method call and that looks
like that was it should we try and print
first we should probably change this
data to parsed result let's try and
print it grab new image
cool this looks more like it for the
record serialization means converting an
object into a stream of bytes and
deserialization usually means the
opposite converting a stream of bytes
into an object but for simplicity Apple
group sees both under NS Jason
serialization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
