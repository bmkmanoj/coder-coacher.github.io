class P most precisely P is the set of
languages recognized by an order n to
the K deterministic Turing machine for
some natural number K there are several
important things to note about this
definition first is that P is a set of
languages intuitively we talk about P as
a set of problems but to be rigorous we
have to ultimately define it in terms of
languages a second point is the word
deterministic we haven't seen a
non-deterministic Turing machine yet but
one is coming deterministic just means
that given a current state and tape
symbol being read there's only one
transition for the machine to follow by
an order n to the K time Turing machine
here I mean a Turing machine with
running time order n to the K as we
define the terms a minute ago perhaps
the most interesting thing about this
definition is the choice of for any K in
the natural numbers why is this the
right definition after all if K is a
hundred then deciding the language isn't
tractable in practice the answer is that
the notion of the class P doesn't
exactly capture what is tractable in
practice it's not clear that any
mathematical definition would stand the
test of time in this regard given how
often computers change or how it could
be relevant in so many contexts this
choice however does have some very nice
properties first is that it matches
tractability better than one might think
in practice K is usually low for
polynomial algorithms and there are
plenty of interesting problems not known
to be in P second is that the definition
is robust to changes in the model that
is to say P is the same for single tape
multi tape machines random access
machines and so forth in fact we pointed
out that the running times for each of
those models are polynomial related when
we introduce them lastly P has the nice
property of closure under the
composition of algorithms if one
algorithm calls another algorithm as a
subroutine a polynomial number of times
then that algorithm is still polynomial
and the problem it solves is NP in other
words if we do something efficient a
reasonably small number of times
then the overall solution will be
efficient P is exactly the smallest
class of problems containing linear time
algorithms and which is closed under
composition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
