psychologist could examine this case
however the specific question of why no
one reacted when a lot of people saw and
heard it would be examined by a social
psychologist cognitive psychologists
usually look at how people perceive
things remember things how they solve
problems and things like that in a
developmental psychologist we'll look at
how thought and behavior changes or
remains the same across the lifespan so
it might be confusing because a clinical
psychologist deals with diagnosing
mental illness and in this situation may
help to determine if the attacker was
mentally stable but again this question
was focusing on why no one helped that
could also be the case for a forensic
psychologist a forensic psychologist
might want to examine the person who
committed the crime or the crime itself
now the key here is that even though
this question was directed towards a
social psychologist a clinical or even a
forensic psychologist could also examine
this case but I'm gonna send you to Greg
to talk a little bit more about forensic
psychology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
