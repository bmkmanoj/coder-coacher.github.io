promptly going to forget this is called
joints so this is a type of sequel query
that you can use that involves multiple
tables remember we had our linked table
we've been working with that this entire
lecture it looks something like this
it's got the columns you know ID and
votes and the user ID you submitted it
you know data title URL so let's make up
some values for these now what I want to
talk about right now is this user ID
column remember I mentioned before that
if we had another table called users
that looks something like this
you know it's got a column for ID and a
column for name and password and end
date the user ID in the links table
refers to the the ID column of the user
table this should always match up
because you know you want every you know
everything in your system to be you know
consistent you know so for every every
unique user ID in the links table there
should be a valid user in the user table
now one of the things we can do in most
sequel databases is something called a
joint which is a sequel statement that
involves two tables so we have a basic
sequel statement that looks something
like this
so select from the linked table where
user ID equals 22 and so that would
return all of the links submitted by
this user you know assuming there is
more than one now what if we didn't know
the users ID what if instead we wanted
to select from the link table all of the
links submitted by users with the
namespace well there's a couple ways you
could do that you could first do a
lookup for you know which what is the
user ID of the person names bez you know
grab this user ID and then run this
sequel query so you could do two queries
it might look something like this so I
could run one query to get the ID from
the user table for the user whose name
equals Fez and then we can use that ID
in a second query but there's another
way of doing this query I could instead
of running two queries combined us into
one query so instead of from linked we
can change this to linked comma user
which will scan both tables and we don't
want to get all of the after
we want to preserve the same results in
the query so we don't want to select
star from Lincoln user we want to select
link dot star which will return just the
columns from the link table and then we
want to change our where clause to link
these two tables so where user
underscore ID equals user dot ID I I
could have also said link that user
underscore ID so we include the table
names and all of our properties that'll
make things more more clear I need to
add another Clause to this and user dot
name equal space so what does this do
select all of the columns from link link
that star from the link table and the
user table where username equals spez
and link that user ID equals user dot ID
and what this does is what's called a
join query and your sequel engine will
decide which of these tables to scan
first and in this case it'll probably do
the user table first so it'll finally
username spez and then they'll find all
the links whose user underscore ID
property matches the ID field and the
user table so this is the handy thing
now the reason I said we're gonna learn
something that we're probably going to
forget is because we don't use joins
very often when writing web software you
know it's it's a it's something you'll
see in almost every sequel tutorial but
for reasons we'll explain later in this
in this lecture joins don't work very
well for the types of problem so we're
gonna be solving writing web stuff but
you should be familiar with them you
should know what they are and you know
you may be writing something that
requires this but you know they're often
well as I said we'll get we'll get into
this later in the lecture why we don't
want to use joints let's move on to
something new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
