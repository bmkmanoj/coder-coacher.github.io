do something a little bit different if
you remember we had a product rule that
let us split up a root of a and B if
these were factors of a radicand we
could split the root up into the nth
root of a time's the nth root of B well
it turns out there's a similar rule for
division the quotient rule lets us take
the nth root of a fraction we can just
split it up into M througt of a divided
by the nth root of B this means that the
cube root of this fraction becomes the
cube root of 27 divided by the cube root
of 16 we're just using our quotient rule
we know the cube root of 27 will in
abeam 3 since we can rewrite 27 as 3
cubed but we can't exactly take the cube
root of 16 16 is 2 to the 4th we don't
want this cube root to appear in a
denominator so we need to rationalize
this part if we can get this power to be
a multiple of 3 then we would be able to
take the cube root of it for example I
really want this denominator to become
the cube root of 2 to the 6 I can take
the cube root of this it's just 2
squared so when we rationalize the
denominator of a higher order root we
want to raise the power of each factor
of the radicand to be a multiple of the
index of the root in other words we want
to have powers inside the radical that
are evenly divisible by the index of the
root so what will supply this numerator
in this denominator by to change our
denominator into this form keep in mind
that whatever we multiply the
denominator by we need to multiply the
numerator by since we're really just
multiplying by a form of 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
