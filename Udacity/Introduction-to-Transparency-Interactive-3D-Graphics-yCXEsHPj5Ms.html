opaque materials where light hits the
surface and bounces off for a number of
reasons transparent objects are more
challenging first light refracts and so
changes its direction when it hits a
transparent surface for example here
light comes from the surface of the
pencil travels through water and hits
the glass the glass causes the light to
go in a different direction such the
different light rays reach our eyes and
cause the pencil to look bent this
change in direction can also affect the
distribution of light on a surface this
crystal ball acts similarly to a lens
focusing the light and creating various
bright spots below it in computer
graphics we call these bright spots
caustics the color and intensity of the
light can be filtered by the transparent
object the farther array of light
travels through an object the more light
that can be absorbed even thin filters
can change the color of the light all of
these effects can be simulated or at
least approximated a convincing way
refraction where the light changes
Direction is expensive to do correctly
I'll be discussing it further in later
lessons it's also possible to compute
the amount of light absorbed due to
traveling through an object though this
can be costly in the following lessons
I'm going to focus on absorption of
light by thin transparent surfaces such
as these eyeglass filters to simplify
further still I'll be talking about only
the effect of such filters on objects
visible through them in other words I
won't be talking about how light passes
through such a filter reaches another
surface and then travels to the eye
I'll only be talking about light that
travels from the object through the
filter this all sounds like a lot of
simplification but you can get wonderful
effects from just this form of filtering
alone for example this fantastic demo
made by Alexandre Roddick shows how
transparency can be used to great effect
there are other cool effects going on
here such as the god rays of light but
transparency is what really makes this
demo shine it's one of my favorite WebGL
