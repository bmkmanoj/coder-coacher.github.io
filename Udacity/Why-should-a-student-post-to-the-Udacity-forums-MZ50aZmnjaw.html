manager here at Udacity so mark why
should a student post to the Udacity
forms that's a very excellent question
why should you not want to oppose to the
forums there's a couple things of why
should you use the forums number one is
the forums are there or do most likely
have your answer already so if you're
working on a project you're working
through the course and if you find out
that you have a question and if you're
stuck on something most likely there is
already an answer there most likely
you're a fellow student has already
asked that question and then you can
just simply go to the forum search for
search for it and then find your answer
there the second thing of why you should
use the form is to also practice your
communication skills on the forum and
specifically how you should communicate
your problem and how you should also
conduct yourself on the phone because
we've noticed that the questions that
are being posted the ones that get
answered frequently and the fastest are
the ones that give everyone else the
entire context the entire information so
when you're posting on the forums I
really highly recommend you to really
start thinking about how you should
phrase and frame your question and how
you should give everyone the entire
context of your situation like here's my
problem here's what I'm doing here's
what I've done here's some snippets of
my code if you have an code if you're
working on a noun degree that has you
know kodom in it but basically give
everyone their entire context and let
everyone know what you know so that
could help you prevent a lot of back and
forth stuff and help you go ahead and
communicate in a very succinctly ficient
manner the forums will really give you a
good area for you to practice these
communication skills and third want to
want to let you know about is go ahead
and help other people and if you teach
the subject yourself you are more
you will actually have a deeper
knowledge of the mature yourself so in
addition to helping people in addition
to communicating finding the answers the
forums serve as a rich resource for you
to network getting help other people and
then this really this will really help
you gain like understand the knowledge
at a deeper level and as well as bill
your reputation on the forums and which
goes to my fourth reason why you should
use the forums is about networking it's
all about networking we have a huge
array of people from all across the
world from all walks of life and there's
they're all in it together and you've
somehow managed to you know build a
great reputation for yourself guess what
there will be people who want to help
you out later on down the road as well
so I highly recommend you to really use
the forums as your tool to look up the
information you need and also to help
other people out well thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
