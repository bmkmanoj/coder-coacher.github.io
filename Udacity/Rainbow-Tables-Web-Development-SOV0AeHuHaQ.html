completely safe nope sorry to lead you
down this path we have we have more to
do the problem is there are you know a
handful of good hashing algorithms that
people would use for this sort of thing
you know let's let's let's pretend we're
using sha-256 because that's pretty
decent hash algorithm it's somewhere to
go through and create a mapping of every
word to the hash of that word that would
be a problem because remember the whole
strength of this hashing problem is that
it's really hard to get from the hash to
the plaintext that led to that hash you
know to if you have h of a you know the
hash of a it's really hard to figure out
a but if you've already computed it for
every word and all you have to do is you
know compute at once and create the
inverse table once somebody has this
table of all these words computed once
they're done you know if you created a
mapping of you know the SHA 56 of every
word to the original word all of a
sudden you get it you get a database of
a bunch of sha-256 passwords you can
look up what the password is instantly
and this table has a name it's called a
rainbow table there are these things
these mappings these databases of a
hashed version of a password to the
clear text password they exist
you can google for a rainbow table for a
hash algorithm of your choice you know
download that hash table or you know
download that mapping turn it into a
hash table and you're good to go there's
a very simple way to get around this you
may remember from our cookie approach
that all we have to do is add in some
secrets but we don't want to add in the
same secret over and over again
otherwise you're basically vulnerable to
the same very similar technique so what
we do instead is we use something called
a salt so in our user table we're
storing our name and we're storing a
hash of the password instead of storing
just a hash with a password we're gonna
add a secret to it it's similar to how
we did with the cookies except this is
not really secret we're just going to
say this hash is going to equal our
hashing function of the password plus
salt and this salt instead of so this
looks very similar to what we did with
the cookies right we were using H Mac
and we had a password and and a secret
and said this salt is just it's just
some random characters we make up you
can make them up and you store them in
the hash field in the clear
so in this
will actually have the hash and we'll
just abbreviate that as H and right
along with it we'll have the salt and
what this does is this prevents this
quick lookup from working because all of
a sudden we've added this these random
strings so instead of saying hash of a
equals a we have to figure out what's
well what's hash of a you know plus the
salt and all of a sudden that table is
completely invalid so when you store a
user you know this is a type of
algorithm you can do now outside of this
class I want you to think very hard
about doing this yourself you know as
with all crypto you should probably not
be implementing it yourself because
people have thought this through they've
done it securely and you are not yet
qualified to do so I want you to think
very hard about using third-party
libraries because a lot of third-party
libraries also get this wrong so
basically think very hard you want to
get this right there's a couple more
things I'll tell you to look for when
you're evaluating a third-party library
but a lot of them really screw this up
and you don't want to just trust them
blindly so you know I'd rather you do it
yourself knowing how to do it then you
trust a third-party library blindly but
the best knowledge you can have is what
to look for in a third party
authentication library let's go ahead
and implement some naive functions for
you know hashing and salting a password
so you can see how the flow works and
then we'll talk about some of the things
you should look for when you're
evaluating you know somebody's approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
