these successor states and then is
tested finding out that this state the
state in this state are identical to the
initial state one could make the
generator itself smarter and say that
the generator will not even generate
these three states because we will know
that it should not generate states that
have already appeared this means that we
can either provide the generator with
some additional abilities or the tester
with some additional abilities or both
if the generator was smarter then it
would not even generate these three
states because they are non productive
however it still may be the tester that
determines that this state is illegal
and therefore dismisses it we could even
go one step further and make a generator
even smarter so the generator will not
generate this particular state and
that's the balance between the generator
and the tester can shift depending on
where we try to put knowledge for this
problem for this relatively simple and
small problem the balance of
responsibility between the generated in
tests might look like a tree will issue
but imagine a problem in which there
were a million such states then whether
we have generated very smart all the
tests are very smart or both can become
an important issue despite that of
generator in test in fact is a very
popular method in some schools of AI
genetic algorithms for instance can be
viewed as generating tests given a
number of states they try to find out
all the potential successor states that
are possible given some simple rules of
recombination and then have a fitness
function that X as a tester genetic
algorithms therefore our effective
method for a very large number of
problems there are also a very
inefficient method because needle
generator not yet tested in genetic
algorithms especially smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
