is how thoroughly the participants
examine the artifact there are a variety
of means that have been devised to
encourage this thoroughness line-by-line
coverage of the code or the documents
involved
similarly if it's a diagram that's being
reviewed a review to going through
systematically on the visual elements of
the diagram if we're talking about the
early stages the requirements document
it may be there's use cases and making
sure that all the use cases are gone
through another technique for ensuring
or promoting thoroughness comes at
things from a little bit different point
of view and this is a checklist based
reviews the checklist is based on common
types of defects either derived from
common industrial practices or company
specific empirical data so for example
if it's a code review there and the
company has a history of problems with
correctly interfacing with libraries
then it might be that you add a
checklist for making sure that library
interfaces are looked at a little bit
more deeply and one one other one is
coverage of verification conditions this
is kind of a specialized checklist
verification conditions were invented as
part of the cleanroom software
engineering methodology by IBM a
verification condition is a rule that
obtains in a particular situation for
example when a loop is encountered
during a code review a specific
verification condition is to examine
whether the loop is guaranteed to
terminate under all circumstances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
