find the element which occurs most often
consecutively in a list and in this case
it's 5 because there are three five in a
row and that's more than any of the
other elements in a row there are more
sixes but they're split they're not in
one consecutive list and I'm going to
talk about this as a sub list so we're
looking for the longest sub list of the
same elements repeated now in order to
do that we're going to have to keep
track of some things we're going to have
to keep track of our best element as we
go we're going to have to keep track of
how long the sub list containing the
best element is and as we go we're going
to have to keep increasing our count as
we find another element that's the same
as the previous one so for six we're
going to have to keep track of the fact
we're looking at six and the number of
sixes that are occurring so we can
compare them with these two values here
so i'm going to introduce two more
variables i'm going to introduce current
and the current lens so to start off
with we haven't got any information and
we look at seven well that's my current
one and there's one off them so okay
I've got 17 that's definitely the best
because I haven't got anything else
before and there's one of them now we
move on from seven and we get to six
well there's 16 move on again and that's
not better than we had before so we're
not going to replace best element with
six now we come on to the second 60 well
now we've got two sixes that's actually
better than we had before so I'm going
to replace the seven with a six and the
length with two we haven't got 6s
anymore so we're not going to increase
the count for six we're going to start a
new count 45 got 15 two fives three
fives and now we're out of 5 let's
compare that with our best element from
before it was six and there were only
two of them so five and three is better
there's more fives so now we're not
dealing with five anymore we're dealing
with six again and there's 16
two sixes so now we compare the number
of sixes with the number of fives and
there aren't enough so we're not going
to replace the values there and we come
on 27 there's 17 and again we're not
going to replace the value so our
procedure should return five so now
let's look at the code to do that we're
going to define a procedure longest
repetition which has a list as its input
now when we first start we don't know
what the best element is so I'm going to
say it's none it has length zero if it's
an empty list then there isn't a longest
repetition and the length would
certainly be zero and our current well
we don't have one either and that's
going to have length zero as well so
what do we do we looped through all the
elements in the input list so what are
we going to want to check well let's
check to see if current is equal to the
element or not if it's not equal to the
element then let's make it equal to the
element and let's reset the current
length to one because we've now got an
element so it must occur at least once
we don't know yet whether it will occur
more times because we've only checked
the first time we've seen it in this sub
list if current is equal to the elements
then we're going to increase the length
by one because we've got a second one so
our sub list is one longer than it was
before in either case we want to check
whether the element we have is greater
than the length that we have stored as
our Burt best length of a sub list at
the moment if it is better then we're
going to replace our best element with
the current one and we're going to
replace our length with the current
length and so when this for loops run
through all that that's left to do is
return best element and that completes
the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
