loop through all of the elements in of
all the instances of class b and they
are pointed to by instances of class a
what this means is we have to loop
through all the a's in order to get to
all the B's and do whatever we're going
to do with them this approach if which
is involves pointers in one direction
only can be cumbersome and costly
instead you could implement the
association between classes foo and bar
by interests by introducing a new class
an association class that has two
attributes one is a name of our pointer
to foo instance and the other is a
pointer to the bar instance that is the
instances are essentially a set of pairs
we have rarefied or made our association
itself into an object is then an easy
matter to link through all the
possibility to loop through all the
possibilities because they're all
instances of this association class
there is a cost associated with doing
this in the cost takes the form of an
extra step if we want to go from a
particular foo to a particular bar
instead of having a reference or pointer
directly to it we have to go to the
association object look up that
particular instance of the foo class
find the Associated instance of the bar
class and Traverse in an extra step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
