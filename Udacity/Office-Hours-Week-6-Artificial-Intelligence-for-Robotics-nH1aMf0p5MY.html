this will be the last office hours let's
get started so the first question comes
from mjl and he wants to know how graphs
lamb deals with non distinguishable
landmarks so let's call the
correspondence problem is if he turns
out to be the heart of the two problems
I gave me the problem of how to solve
for known correspondence which becomes a
kind of a continuous optimization
problem but is also discreet problem
here which is does this landmark
correspond with this guy over here or do
they pay over here they are solutions
one of the best ones is called ransack
where you randomly assign
correspondences 43 of what n works solve
the set of equations and then look for
best nearby matches and fill them in and
you repeat this so you can get rid of
local minimum in general if your robot
is very accurate then just picking the
newsletter bug is a good heuristic but
if you go through a huge cycle you might
just not connect and it might be
multiple ways to connect and then really
can use his Rancic methods to try
multiple choices ok thanks next question
comes from marcelo 79 and he wants to
know in a real environment we don't know
the number of landmarks and in in the
unit seem like we're always pretending
like we knew so in for example the mind
mapping video that you showed how do we
deal with encountering all these new
landmarks and does do we not get the
same problem that we had with our
position measurements were this matrix
just becomes unwieldy so my 779 that's a
great question and there's many
different answers i can give you one is
if you really had point landmarks the
way I described them like maybe tree
trunks or corners of rooms you can just
grow the matrix using the functions that
provided to you if every new landmark
you just put a new role in a new column
in there that's that's basically it
however the more interesting version of
the question is what is the landmark and
in our mind mapping for example we don't
make this thing features like quarters
landmark instead what we've been doing
is we're taking little small local maps
that are defined over 5 meters of our
motion and we make these maps the basic
entities now it turns out they are
really landmark in the traditional sense
but they still have a location and you
can still match them and see how they
fit together and in matching them you
can make a consider
it's very much like the graph like
constraint that is like range and
bearing or X and by distance and you can
toss them in the same set of equations
and that books really like a trauma
great it sounds sort of like you're
stitching together there's panoramic
photos yeah in there and there's an
entire field of people who stood to get
these local images into global ones
including image stitching panoramic
stitching and so on and they use very
different methods like the 3d
reconstruction of the boat Titanic that
sank years ago there was none of the
local stitches is being stitched
together this way and if you go back all
the way to Gauss 200 years ago when he
invented these squares methods was
basically his attempt to map the land
and get these local constraints together
of measurement points to make a
reasonable map of of our an end and
that's where this all date spectral in
fact he basically invented graph slam 20
years ago just didn't know what all
right the next question comes from MO
and he's talking about how we found all
these great ways of helping our robot
make intelligent decisions but there has
to be some situations where we've just
hard coded some things into like the
Google self-driving car can you talk
about any of those exceptions that have
been hard coded in so my my aspiration
usually is to have no exceptions and try
to come up with a single framework when
the business in my experience every time
you have an if-then-else rule they say
this is the exception is fun isn't at
that border you introduce brittleness
you often get the wrong behavior because
most exceptions aren't here cuts so when
I talk to my students that stand for
them on my team at Google I try to get
rid of any possible if then else
statement now having said this of course
as exceptions test motorcycles there's
cars it turns out cars stay in lanes but
in California probably like the way it
is in India motorcycles tend to be like
between lanes and sneak between cars and
we sometimes have special rules for this
like for example we have rules that say
certain areas are crosswalks have more
likely pedestrians and other process
works in our car will behave differently
for these crosswalks and and react
differently to people on the side of the
street so there's a good number of those
exceptions and the truth is the real
world is messy you have to really go
through those one after another and
address them having set this from the
mathematic perspective the fewer you
have in your code the better alright
next question comes from quartz and he
wants to know how we use slam in a
changing environment and whether there's
a way to forget previous line works and
acquiring new ones quartz is a great
name must be a non-american keyword I
guess it looks like so in changing
environments there's a very simple fix
to it which is as we added uncertainty
to the word position in our system of
equations you can do exactly the same
track for landmark positions it's a
little bit cumbersome but you could say
let's make a lenmar position at time T
and one at time T plus one and the one
at T plus one has added uncertainty very
much like the way they were moved but
there's no motion say and then you
marginalize out the estimate of a time T
using the same math we talked about and
you get a new set of constraints that
are basically in compasses and then
traveling more uncertainty you can even
toss in things like estimates of where
the landmark moves by putting the
velocity at the end months into the
graph slim formalism and actually
carries through turns out I just didn't
do this so that's one way to deal with
dynamic environments okay next one comes
from mjl again and so as a robot moves
its location certain d is going to
increase is there any way to get to pull
out this uncertainty from our Omega
matrix yes there is and it turns out the
Omega matrix is the inverse covariance
matrix I didn't we talked much about
this but it is via the universe
covariance matrix so if you just invert
that matrix you get the full covariance
for all the landmarks in the robot and
if you care about say it's just one
landmark just take the corresponding
columns and rows of this matrix and next
one comes from George brand arrow so he
wants to know what are some interesting
trends in slam research these days do
you think there's any good problems that
you could recommend a young researcher
getting involved with tons of good
problems there's some really fantastic
for coming out of university of
washington by steve sites on taking very
large photo collections and tossing to a
big optimizer to build a 3d map this is
a project that's now at
rise universities and where people go to
flickr or other online for the sides
picasa and the extract those photos the
tourists have taken and establish
correspondence say for buildings and so
on and then we construct how this object
looked in dense reconstruction that's in
computer vision often called structure
for motion and we call it slam and
robotics anything having to do with
dennis data like with go to google maps
for example and get oblique shots and
ground shots from street view and and
aerial shots from an aerial probe or
from a satellite and rectify this into a
3d model these are basically unsolved
problems there's some really good
progress but the moment you have bridges
and underpasses and occlusion there's a
ton of opportunity you can actually take
your cell phone camera or your camera
let's go through environment and try to
make a full model of your kitchen right
that in itself is a very very hard and
then if you add the fact that the word
might be dynamic like options might be
deformable it's piece of paper over here
you want to model this in 3d let's eat
mine and it's a fantastic research are
either will be with us for the next at
these two decades okay all right well
the last question comes from kate mb and
he wants to know about using landmark
correlation so for example in our in our
model of omega we assume that two
landmarks were never if they can see
each other but in reality sometimes we
have some correlation between landmarks
so for example streetlights come at
regular intervals do we ever implement
this and if we did would it help what
did it would absolutely help any
information you can bring to bear as
good so this question is like the same
questions having a mighty robot
situations the multiple robots interact
and they move around and they can see
each other and in seeing each other you
insulate constraint that's between these
two robots I've had landmarks that
either could sense each other maybe you
have Wi-Fi beacons and they can sense
each other strength in a building or if
you have a external knowledge like the
pattern of schedule of LED light lamps
this is super informative the formalism
fails the part falls apart when there is
a negative information like for example
there shall be no street lamp within a
hundred foot radius of the current
street lamp and the reason is these
negative constraints are very hard
express in a graph like fashion pause
information like this one is this far
away from the sky is much easier to
express but yeah so in general any
information can bring to bear will help
you solve these really hard problems
alright well that was the last question
and since this is the last office hour
someone say big thank you to you
Sebastian thank you for you in here and
a huge thank you to the students it's
been really amazing working in the
forums and helping you out with this
course for the last seven weeks I know
I've learned a lot I hope you guys have
to and I learned a lot I really love
your questions i love your interaction
love hanging out in the forum in the
evenings i hope you guys learned a lot
and i hope these office hours in the
course and which is your life and
empowers you to do things you've never
done before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
