first I want to identify where is the
roller coaster going to be going the
fastest and the answer is when it's down
here this is the lowest point in the
roller coaster and therefore the point
when the lowest potential energy which
means the highest kinetic energy and
let's see down here what kind of energy
does it have it has kinetic energy I
know it's got to be moving down here and
it even has a little bit of potential
energy if I'm using the ground as my
reference point for zero so let's see
energies conserve means energy up here
equals energy down here roller coaster
starts at rest which means it starts
with only potential energy I'm she going
to call this h1 to distinguish it from
this H over here by the time it gets to
the bottom it still has a little bit of
potential energy and it has kinetic we
know motion doesn't depend on mass and
luckily the masses cancel out I can do a
little bit of massaging of this equation
to get into this form for V squared then
the solver velocity I just take the
square root and look at that all that
matters the only way that height comes
into this equation is through the change
in height h1 minus h2 this is really
pointing out the fact that we can choose
our zero point anywhere and all that
matters is the change in height well
let's plug in our numbers well when I do
this I get a very nice number I get the
square root of 900 which is exactly 30
meters per second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
