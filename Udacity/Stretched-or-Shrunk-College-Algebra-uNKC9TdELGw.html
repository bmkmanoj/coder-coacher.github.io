parabolas we set that changing the
coefficient out in front of the x
squared change the width of the parabola
putting a fraction out in front like
one-third or one half made the graph
really wide and putting a bigger number
like two or three a number greater than
1 as the coefficient made the graph
skinnier like we see in c and d however
let's think about this from a vertical
point of view instead now instead of
thinking about these as making graphs
wider or skinnier we can think about
these coefficients actually making the
graph taller or shorter changing this
coefficient changes what the y-value is
going to be for any given x value graphy
down here is our parent parabola y
equals x squared while we see the point
2 comma 4 here on graph B we can see
that when the x-coordinate is to the y
coordinate is not all the way up at four
it's only half ways tall you can imagine
that if I drew a vertical line going
from the x-axis all the way up to where
the line meets the graph we can compare
how tall graphs are to one another by
picking this same x value and then
seeing how tall that line is how many
units in the Y direction it takes to hit
our graph but what determines if a graph
is stretching like in graph d or
shrinking like in graph B remember this
is in the Y direction the vertical
direction something clearly has to
happen in their equations to make this
happen in their graphs let's use good ol
y equals x squared as our starting point
the function that we're going to
transform when x squared in this
function is x a value that is greater
than 0 but less than 1 well the graph be
vertically stretched or vertically
shrunk now on the other hand if x
squared is x a value that is greater
than 1 what will happen to the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
