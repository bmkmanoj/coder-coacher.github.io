statement true is positive one that's
amazing work if you got this one correct
it was tough first we'll square both
sides of the equation to get 4x squared
plus 4x plus 1 equal to 5x plus 4 next
we want to get a quadratic on one side
of the equation and the other side equal
to zero so we can subtract 5x from both
sides and subtract 4 from both sides
will have 0 on the right and this
quadratic on the left next we use
factoring by grouping to get 4x plus 3
times X minus 1 equals 0 once we have
our factors of 4x plus 3 and X minus 1
we set each of those equal to 0 then we
can solve for x so x equals negative 3
force or x equals positive one and like
all of our radical equations from before
we need to check each of these solutions
in the original equation when i plug in
x equals 1 I get three equals three so
yes this will be part of our solution
set for x equals negative 3 force we
wind up with a solution that doesn't
check we know 2 times negative
three-fourths is negative 3 halves since
we can cancel the common factor of 2 in
the numerator and denominator here we'll
just multiply 5 times negative 3 force
to get negative 15 force we changed for
into 16 force so we can add these two
fractions together this gives us a
positive one fourth underneath our
radical we take the radical of the
numerator and the denominator to get one
half since the square root of 1 is 1 and
the square root of 4 is 2 on the left
side i change this improper fraction to
a mixed number negative one and one-half
we know negative 1 and positive 1 sum to
0 so we're left with negative one-half
these two statements are not true so we
cannot include this as part of our
solution set it's out this is why a
solution set is only positive one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
