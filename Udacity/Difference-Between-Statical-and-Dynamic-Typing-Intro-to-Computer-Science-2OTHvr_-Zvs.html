language will require less code and
there are two reasons for that one is
because you don't need all the type
declarations the other is code can be
more versatile in our Python code we can
write a double procedure that works on
both numbers and strings probably a bad
idea but we can do it with a statically
typed language like Java there's no way
to do that you've got to write different
procedures if you want them to work on
different types a static language would
be less likely for programs to crash and
the reason for that is because you find
your bugs earlier you find them when you
compile the program before the program
is running at least some of the bugs the
more fun is a fairly subjective question
I'm going to go with dynamic is more fun
and it's more fun because you can
usually get things to happen more
quickly it requires less effort to get a
program working and behaving pretty
close to correct if a static language
you have to get your program lot closer
to correct before you can start playing
with it it's also easier to make changes
in a dynamic language other people might
disagree and one problem with the
dynamic language what all is going well
you can be nice and happy if things
start to break with a dynamic language
you might have a much harder time
figuring out what's wrong than you would
with a static language but I'll stick
with my dynamic answer and I hope you
enjoy programming in Python which is a
dynamically typed language program
should execute faster if they're written
in a statically typed language this
depends a lot on the language and the
tools that are used to do this and
there's been a lot of improvements in
making dynamically type language is run
fast but the execution tools have an
advantage in the statically typed
language there's less that they have to
determine at runtime and there's more
they can do in advance so they should
still always be able to run faster
finally which one is better for
programming avionics well you really
don't want to discover your type errors
when you're at 30,000 feet much better
to discover them before you take off so
there static languages have the big
advantage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
