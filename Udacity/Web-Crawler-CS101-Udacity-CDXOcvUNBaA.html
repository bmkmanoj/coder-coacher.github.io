decisions we bid one before ideas I
think the most important thing if you're
going to build a search engine is to
have a really good fun corpus to start
out with in our case we used the world
wide web which at the time was
significantly smaller than it was today
but it was also very new and exciting
there were all sorts of unexpected
things there so the goal for the first
three units of the course is to build
that corpus and we want to build a
corpus for our search engine by crawling
the web and that's what a web crawler
does what a web crawler is is a program
that collects content from the web if
you think of a web page that you see in
your browser you have a page like this
and we'll we'll use the Udacity site as
an example web page so it's got lots of
content it's got some images it's got
some text all of this comes into your
browser when you request the page the
important thing that it has is links and
what a link is is something that goes to
another page so we have a link to the
frequently asked questions we have a
link to the cs101 page there's some
other links on the page and that link
may show up in your browser with an
underscore it may not depending on how
your browser is set but the important
thing that it does is it's a pointer to
some other web page and those other web
pages may also have links so we have
another link on this page maybe it's
time I my name you can follow to my home
page and all the pages that we can find
whether our web crawler are found by
following the links so that won't
necessarily find every page on the web
if we start with a good seed page we'll
find lots of pages though and what the
crawler is going to do is start with one
page find all the links on that page
follow them to find other pages and then
on those other pages it will follow the
links on those pages to find other pages
and there will be lots more links on
those pages and eventually we'll have a
collection of lots of pages on the web
so that's what we want to do to build a
web crawler we want to find some way to
start from one seed page extract the
links on that page follow those links to
other pages then collect the links on
those other pages follow them collect
all that so that sounds like a lot to do
we're not going to do that all this
first class what we're going to do in
this first unit is just extract a link
so we're going to start with a bunch
texts it's going to have a link in it
with a URL what we want to find is that
URL so we can request the next page the
goal for the second unit is to be able
to keep going if there's many links on
one page we want to be able to find them
all so that's what we'll do in unit 2 is
figure out a way to keep going to
extract all those links in unit 3 well
we want to go beyond just one page so by
the end of unit 2 we can print out all
the links on one page for unit 3 we want
to collect all those links so we can
keep going end up following our crawl to
collect many many pages so by the end of
unit 3 we'll have built a web crawler
we'll have a way of building our corpus
then the remaining three units we'll
look at how to actually respond to
queries so in unit 4 we'll figure out
how to give a good response so if you
search for a keyword you want to get a
response that's a list of the pages
where that keyword appears and we'll
figure out in unit 5 a way to do that
that scales if we have a large corpus
and then in unit 6 what we want to do is
well we don't want to just find a list
we want to find the best one so we'll
figure out how to rank all the pages
where that keyword appears so we're
getting a little ahead of ourselves now
because all we're going to do for unit 1
is to figure out how to extract a link
from the page and the search engine that
we'll build at the end of this will be a
functional search engine it will have
the main components that a search engine
like Google has it certainly won't be as
powerful as Google will be we want to
keep things simple I want to have a
small amount of code to write and we
should remember that our real goal is
not so much to build a search engine but
to use the goal of building a search
engine as a vehicle for learning about
computer science and learning about
programming so the things that we learn
by doing this will allow us to solve
lots and lots of other problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
