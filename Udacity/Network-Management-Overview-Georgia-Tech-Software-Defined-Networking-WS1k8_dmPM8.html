consistent updates in s DNS as a
reminder from last lesson we looked at
how to update switch flow table entries
using open flow control commands from
the controller the open flow API however
does not provide specific guarantees
about the level of consistency that
packets along an intent path can
experience so for example updates to
multiple switches along a path in a
network that occur at different times
may result in problems such as
forwarding loops additionally if updates
to the switches along an Antan path
occur in the middle of a flow packets
from the same flow may be subjected to
two different Network States these two
problems are known as consistency
problems the first problem is known as a
packet level consistency problem and the
second problem is known as a flow level
consistency problem in this lesson we
will explore these problems in more
detail and look at various approaches to
guaranteeing consistent updates in s DNS
to think about consistency properly we
first need a notion of a high level
programming model that sits on top of
what we would call the southbound
interface we'll talk about how to write
applications that use the controller
interface that we learned about in the
last lesson that can rely on a better
notion of consistency than existing
controller platforms currently provide
let's first think about how we want to
program these applications and what type
of abstraction the applications would
require from the underlying control
interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
