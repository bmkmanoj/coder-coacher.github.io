conventional or traditional tracking
approach what you do is you build a
model before something starts moving
right so you might cut out a patch find
a contour some method of describing the
object and then you do want to remember
we talked about optic flow where you
essentially connect the dots you do
patch tracking with particles which if
you're in the OMS class you did as a
problem set or you might even solve some
interesting complicated optimization
problem and then somehow you try to
incorporate some invariance so you might
use edges because you know that those
don't change a lot depending upon how
the illumination changes let's say all
right but the problem is if I'm going to
track an object over an extended period
of time the object in the environment
tend to change and what I would like to
do is I would like to not just track the
object but in some sense track the
changes incorporate the changes slowly
as the object moves so some work that
we're going to talk about and these are
some slides taken from from yang who
showed a piece of work that will talk
about along with rossum at all they took
some inspiration from two places first
of all Michael black and Alan Jepsen way
back in nineteen ninety six did
something called I ghen tracking so you
guys know all about eigen faces well I
ghen tracking was the same idea but the
idea is so here we have coca-cola cans
and here we have these eigen images up
this one's a 7-up can how did that get
in there ok we have eigen images of
these different objects and the idea was
we're going to track this thing by
finding places that we can represent
well using those eigen images but one of
the cool things they did was they said
you know remember what didn't work so
well in I ghen analysis the eigen face
was the alignment things had to be
aligned perfectly well suppose we
decompose the problem into the geometric
part that is how is my object moving
maybe rotating scaling to what does it
look like now we've already seen this
right when we were doing the good
features to track we talked in fact
there was an image of a speed limit sign
getting bigger and bigger and was being
tracked in the
it's the same image patch it just
deforms well there they were using a
single image patch in the eigen tracking
the idea was that we're going to look
for a deformation so could be a flying
to be otherwise where we got where we
have moat translation rotation scaling
maybe even shearing but now instead of
just taking a single patch we actually
have a set of eigenvectors that describe
the cocaine so for example maybe if I
rotate the cocaine a little bit or maybe
some some other change I could represent
all those different appearances when
they did it it was done in sort of a
nonlinear optimization way and they but
more importantly they took a fixed basis
set so it took a whole bunch of images
of coke cans created a basis set set up
that's our coca-cola basis set so we're
going to need to do some improvement on
that the other inspiration here is also
something that we've covered which was
particle filtering remember uh I Zarda
and Blake they instead of having a
single proposal the ideas you'd have a
bunch of particles in each particle
would represent a possible location and
that allowed us to handle sort of
nonparametric densities or I use this
sampling based approach and they are
what they were using were like contours
right and they would propagate this over
time they would they would move the
particles forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
