almost everything we could relax except
for one thing we're now gonna look at
two-player nonzero-sum not possibly
non-deterministic games of hidden
information cool and that's gonna turn
out to be messy but get us to the place
where I've secretly been trying to get
us all along so let me describe a game
for you very carefully and let's see
where it leads us
okay here's the game you've got two
people these two people are criminals Oh
No are they smooth criminals one of them
is okay so we have two people they're
criminals okay and unfortunately they
both been captured by the cops I have
actually no idea how to draw that but
let's just try to draw it like this the
cops come along and capture them both
because they are suspected in as
particular robbery okay and they take
them and put them both in jail so those
are jail bars okay but they don't just
put them in jails they put them in two
separate jails no okay
and one cop goes to one criminal and
says listen here's the deal we know you
did it okay well you know you did it and
your friend over there he's currently
singing singing like a bird and he is
going to pin it all on you so this is
your last chance to give us a little
help and admit that you two did it or
that the other guy did it if you admit
that the other guy does it you said it
was his fault then we'll cut you a deal
now
to make it worse the cop tells him that
there's another cop over there who's
talking to the smooth criminal and is
offering him the same deal and whoever
goes first
whoever pins it on the other guy first
gets to walk okay
so if I can get the curly head guy to
effect okay then I am going to let him
walk and he will spend zero months in
jail okay okay on the other hand if the
other guy defects then he's going to get
to spend zero time in jail and since
we've got all that we need we got a
confession to get this guy to go to jail
he's going to go to jail for nine months
okay nine months yeah oh that's a cost
in money that's the cost in months okay
so if curly-haired guy defects before
the other guy does then zero he walks he
pays no cost other than the cost he's
already paid for a life of crime now if
he refuses to drop a dime on the other
guy but the smooth criminal decides to
defect he's going to lose nine months
that makes sense and the other guy's
gonna walk so he's getting the same deal
they're both getting the same deal you
got it yeah all right now it's a little
more complicated than that all right I
hope you're getting off keeping all this
in your heads a little more complicated
than that
there's actually four choices here not
just two it's not just a case of ID
effect or the other guy defects ID
effect the other guy doesn't I don't
defect the other guy does okay you could
both refuse to drop a dime on the other
you could cooperate or you could both
rat out the other at the same exact
moment at the exam at the same exact
moment so there's a big thick wall here
curly guy doesn't know what smooth guys
doing and smooth guy doesn't know what
curly guy is doing right so the question
is if you have a choice between either
defecting or which means blaming the
others means blaming the other guy
you're defecting from your friendship Oh
or you can cooperate that is be true to
your friendship I can with both people
can defect both people can cooperate one
person can defect and the other person
cooperates so there's actually four
different options there I feel like
matrix coming on yeah I think there's a
matrix coming on so let's draw the
matrix because I think that makes it
easier to see but you have the
background here right I think chef yeah
the key piece here is that each person
has a choice of either defecting from
their friendship or trying to cooperate
keeping their mouth shut and they don't
know
the other person is doing so what are
all the costs here what are the
worst-case thing so let's just draw it
all out as a matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
