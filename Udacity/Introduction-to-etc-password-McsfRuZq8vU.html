this information such as our username
our home directories the shell much of
this information is found within a file
that stores information about each user
this file is called ET c / password
let's take a look at that file using the
cat command each line within this file
is an entry for a single user and each
entry has a number of fields that are
separated by colon characters let's find
the entry for our current user vagrant
the line looks like this vagrant x 1000
1000 to Colin's home vagrant bin bash
these two numbers 1000 1000 might be
different on your system but that's okay
it's nothing to worry about the first
field reads vagrant and that's this
users username the second field used to
store encrypted passwords historically
storing encrypted passwords in this file
wasn't an issue as the hardware was too
slow to crack a well-chosen password
these days almost every distribution
will just insert a character that is
ignored in this field in this case you
Bunty uses an X the third and fourth
field store your user ID and group ID
we'll discuss these a bit more when we
get into talking about file permissions
there's a fifth field here that may be
hard to see since it doesn't include any
text it's empty this field is used to
store a better description about this
user you can see one user does have a
better description here matts and then
this full description Nats bug reporting
system admin the last two fields are the
user's home directory and finally the
users default shell our home directory
is slash home slash vagrant as we
already knew and our default shell is
bin bash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
