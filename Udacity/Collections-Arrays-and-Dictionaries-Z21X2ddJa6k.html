about Swift collections which include
arrays dictionaries and sets just as a
quick refresher an array is an ordered
list of items a dictionary is a
collection of key-value pairs and a set
is an unordered list of distinct values
of the three arrays are the only
collection that has a defined order and
also the only one that may have repeated
values as an iOS developer you're sure
to use arrays and dictionaries on a
daily basis you're undoubtedly already
familiar with these data structures but
it will pay to really internalize their
swift implementations for example when
we get to the networking course you'll
be using dictionaries a lot in parsing
JSON will also briefly talk about sets
for this module you'll want to open up
the playground file entitled lesson 3
collections
let's start with arrays arrays can be
initialized in three ways here's the
first option by now you've seen these
parentheses a few times they represent a
call to a constructor and an it method
where the word in it has been omitted
here I've typed array to specify the
type of the object we're initializing
just like you saw earlier with the light
switch class with collections we also
need to specify the type of the item
that the collection holds so we type
double here in between angle brackets
and in the end the statement will
initialize an empty array of doubles you
actually will rarely see that first
option used more often you'll see
shorthand that looks like this again I'm
initializing an empty array the square
brackets let the compiler know that it's
an array so I don't need to type out
array anymore and then I indicate the
type double between square brackets like
before the parentheses at the end
signify the constructor and then I can
add items to my more numbers array like
this the third and most concise option
for initialization is to use array
literal syntax here I just create a list
of the contained items separated by
commas and enclose them in square
brackets the same way I did to add items
to the previous array this array also
holds items of type double but as we've
seen before the arrays type can be
inferred by the compiler
it's super easy to combine these two
arrays by can
patting them with the plus operator or
to be even more concise I can use the
compound assignment operator
notice that the compiler doesn't allow
me to add values to an array that's been
defined as a constant using let if I've
defined an array as a constant I need to
define a new constant in order to
concatenate the two an array can hold
any type of object including custom
classes for example here I'll define an
array called circuit which holds objects
of type LightSwitch and then I'll add
some light switches I want the circuit
array to keep track of or I could just
define the areas components from the
get-go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
