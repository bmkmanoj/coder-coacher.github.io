misconceptions that you find when
dealing with human robot interaction
where a person tends to believe
something is going to occur with a robot
but really doesn't I think the biggest
thing is like at a cultural level like
there's this concept that robots are
scary right people are not going and the
reality is and we put these in front of
people and love it right this thing is
not scary you know we're not building
some big sci-fi robot
you know with lasers in its eyes there's
a cute little thing about this bigness
about hey how's it going right and just
has a simple conversation and so while
again there might be this big conception
that robots are scary things or
technology to talk to you about your
healthcare not good be on the ground
reality when we put this in front of
patients they love it I think that's the
biggest lesson and part of that just
comes from iteratively building and
testing this with a lot of people over
many years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
