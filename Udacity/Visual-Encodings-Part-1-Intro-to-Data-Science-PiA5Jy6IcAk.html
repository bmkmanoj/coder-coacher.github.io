visual queues are one of the main
ingredients to an effective
visualization in the next couple of
videos we'll cover some of the main
visual cues that you can use to
represent data in your charts the first
one that we're going to discuss is
position when using position as a visual
cue you compute value by looking at the
position of a point compared to the
position of others in the same space or
coordinate system here this would
translate to this points x and y
coordinate position is a useful encoding
because it takes up less space than
other visual cues it's really space
efficient each data point is simply
represented as a dot also points often
have the same size which allows you to
easily identify trends clusters and
outliers by plotting all of your data at
once but if you have too many data
points in your plot it can be a
challenge to identify what each point
represents for example imagine that this
chart were covered with dozens of green
dots just like this one it might be hard
for us to identify individual dots and
really understand what they mean or what
data they correspond to another commonly
used visual cue is length which is often
encountered in the form of bar charts
the length of a bar indicates the
intensity or value of your data point
for example the longer the bar the
greater the absolute value one more
encoding that's very common is angle
angle ranges from 0 to 360 degrees on a
circle angles are commonly used to
represent parts of a whole a pie chart
is a really common example of this the
sum of the wedges in this pie complete a
circle and give us 360 degrees one
negative aspect to using angles as a
visual encoding is that human eyes can
have a difficult time differentiating
angles for example 25° and 30° may look
very similar because of this angle is an
encoding that you may want to avoid if
you're trying to show very small
differences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
