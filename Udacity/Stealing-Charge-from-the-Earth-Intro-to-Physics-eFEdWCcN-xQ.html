is that the earth is not an insulator
the only reason this method works at all
that we can draw these electrons up from
the earth is because the earth is more
of a conductor than an insulator so that
was a bad answer also the earth is not
able to create electrons nothing can
create an electron without also somehow
creating a corresponding positive charge
the truth is part of the reason why we
can do this is because the earth is just
gigantic so what if I take a few
negative charges from the earth
eventually they'll probably wind up back
in the earth the truth is the earth
serves as an infinite source and sink of
electrons source means for all effective
purposes we can count on the earth to
provide us with whatever electrons we
need in this situation likewise we can
also deposit electrons into the earth
essentially infinitely this idea that
the earth is an infinite source and sink
of electrons well that's what the word
grounding means let's start to lucci
alfredo NAC to see what he is the same
at the topic we say that the bodies is
grounded when it is in electrical
communication with the earth so there is
an electrical conductor and electrical
path connecting it to the earth and
making it one conductor together with
the earth and it is a good situation so
to say because the earth is a big
conductor and so quantities of charge
influence it little this seems like it
might be a useful concept this idea of
grounding when we have a lightning
strike and we need somewhere to put all
of that electricity looks like we're
making some serious progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
