three dentists out of five dentists to
describe the ratio of dentists that
prefer a certain toothpaste but in math
are units which in this case we're
referring to dentists they behave a bit
like numbers actually and so what that
means is when I have dentists / dentists
like this I can actually simplify by
just crossing out the common we could
think of it as a factor this means that
three dentists out of five dentists is
the same as three fifths that is our
ratio here and it's just a pure number
again no units involved at all we'll see
why this is useful in a bit but first
let's do a little bit of practicing
let's look at the first ratio from our
previous question eight out of 10 cats
prefer whiskers can you write this as a
ratio and to your answer in this box and
keep in mind what we did here to go from
three out of five dentists to just three
over five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
