and kept Bellman's equation the most
important equation ever and we are going
to solve it so how are we gonna make
that work okay so how many so we wrote
this down as a utility of f how many S's
are there s and i don't know pick a
letter n in so we have n states which
means this isn't really one equation
this is how many equations and yes it's
in equations how many unknowns are there
well we have au the R's are known the
T's are known the only thing that's
missing is the use and there's oh
there's any of those as well right so
there's n equations in n unknowns so
we're done yes because we know how to
solve n equations in n unknowns right if
the equations were linear if the
equations are linear are these equations
linear I'm gonna go with no why not
because the max is problematic that's
right
this max off operation makes it
nonlinear so it looks really good for a
moment there we've got in equations in
unknowns we know how to solve that
but max makes for a very very very weird
non-linearity and there's kind of no
nice way to deal with this actually one
day Michael if you ask me there is a
cute little side you can do where you
can turn max into something that's
differentiable but that doesn't actually
help us here so I'm not gonna go off on
that aside yet but even differentiable
wouldn't quite be linear that's right
and it wouldn't help us in this case
yeah that's exactly right but the fact
that you can have differentiable maxes I
think actually rather cute but also
unimportant for what we're talking about
now so we've got n equations and n
unknowns they're nonlinear which means
we can't solve it the way we want to buy
like inverting matrices or anything like
you people were in the regression would
normally do but it turns out that we can
in fact do something fairly similar
something that actually allows us to
solve this even though it's nonlinear
and here's the equation or the equation
here's here's the algorithm that you use
that sort of works okay so it's really
simple just simply start with some
arbitrary utilities declare those the
answer and you're done that will be one
way of doing it but it turns out we can
do even better weight start off with the
correct utilities that would work he
said we don't know what they are right
so we're gonna start with some arbitrary
utilities but then we're going to
date them based on their neighbors and
then we will simply lather rinse repeat
alright so what does that mean
based on neighbors so it means based on
the states you're going to update the
utility for a state based on all of the
states that it can reach so let me write
down an equation and tells you how to
update that and then maybe it'll be
clear okay so we're gonna have a bunch
of utility since we're gonna we're going
to be looping through this and let's
just say every time we loop through
that's time T okay so we know what the
equation for utility is for the
utilities are it's just the equation
that's written up here so it's R of s
plus gamma times the max over a of the
expected utility right except we have
some estimate of the utility at time T
okay
and probably the right thing for me to
do would be to write this like as you
had or something like that this is my
estimate of the utility and so now using
this I'm gonna want to sort of update
the you know all of my utilities to make
them better and it turns out I can do
that by simply doing this so I'm gonna
update at every iteration update
utilities based on neighbors I'm gonna
update it every year at every iteration
my estimate of the utility of some state
s by simply recalculating it to be the
actual reward that I get for entering
state s plus the discounted utility that
I expect given the original estimates of
my utility does that make any sense at
all yeah guess so so so the s okay so we
need the whole U hat t like in all
states because we're not just using this
the values at state s to update the
values at state s we're using all the
values it's at the the previous time
step to update that all the values at
the current time step yep so all these n
equations are all tangled together right
because of this this expectation so
really just to make it clear this should
be a summation over s Prime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
