lexer that's able to go through and
create tokens for each of the javascript
keywords and also ignore javascript
comments which are specified with little
stars for long comments / in the star
this is a multi-line comment or just a /
/ which comment everything for the rest
of the line so we got two types of
comments to handle we did this one in
class but this one you're going to have
to use some state variable like we did
with HTML in class so let's see how it's
done so here I have the solution the
first thing which we gave you was the
bong list of tokens the names and what
they should match so if I scroll down I
have them all defined it's a little
tedious but it's what you have to do and
it's only a one time thing you have to
do it only thing you really have to keep
in mind is you have to escape characters
that are particular to a regular
expression so freezing mean to escape
the parenthesis we need to escape the
pipes plus star things that I have
meaning in a regular expression so the
other major part of this problem was
handling the comments we have the end of
line comment which we did in lecture and
that's almost exactly the same if you
see two slashes no matter what follows
you simply pass by it but what we're
going to have to handle just like we did
with HTML is if we're in a kind of block
comment a multi-line comment which is
indicated by the slash a star blah blah
blah blah and then another star anise
wash we assign our state's we have a
state called comment and it's exclusive
when you're in a comment you're not in
anything else a comment begins with the
slash and then a star which is indicated
by here you have to escape both of them
since they both that meaning and then we
begin the comment we're done when we see
the other star and then the slush we
increment our line count based on how
many things we've passed by and then we
go back to the initial state we need to
remember an error for when something
goes wrong and then down here I've
defined what we want to ignore
for the common state and it's the same
exact stuff that we ignore when we're
tokenizing the rest of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
