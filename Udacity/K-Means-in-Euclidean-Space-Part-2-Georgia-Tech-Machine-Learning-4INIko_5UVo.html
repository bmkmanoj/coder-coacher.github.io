what happens to this function as in one
step we update the partitions and the
other step we update the centers so
let's look at the partition one first
the way that this partition is being
defined is we for each point loop over
all the clusters and find the cluster
whose centre is closest to X in terms of
squared distance what happens to e
when we do that well we move a point
from one cluster to a different cluster
only if it causes the squared distance
of the center to go down so that means
that the error either stays the same if
the point stays in the same cluster or
it goes down if it goes to a better
cluster that makes sense so it can only
go down well it can never go up that's
different than saying it can only go
down agree cuz it could stay the same
what happens if it stays the same
I guess not necessarily anything
interesting right but certainly when
we've converged it stays the same right
all right now let's look on the other
side here so that's what happens when we
move things into partitions and in some
sense that seems easy because we only
move things if it causes the error to go
down so it really is a lot like hill
climbing on this side though what
happens when we move the center's so
could it be the case that when we move
the center to some other place that the
error goes up no and why do you say that
because the average is going to be the
best way to represent a set of points on
average we should be able to demonstrate
that I think we've already have we did
this earlier in in the course when we
were talking about minimizing least
squares oh you're right so basically you
could take that equation and you just
take the derivative of it set it equal
to zero and it'll turn out to be exactly
the average you're right that's exactly
right
the error equation II that's right yeah
so this is like really kind of neat when
we move points around we move it to
reduce error and we move centers around
we always move it to the center even
though this is a continuous space we
always jump to the center that actually
has minimum error under the assumption
that we're holding the partition steady
right so this is just great so put them
together you're guaranteed to be let's
see what what's the math term
monotonically non-increasing an error
monotonically non-increasing an error
very nice and does that imply that the
thing has to converge could we be
monotonically non-increasing in error
ever you could in some worlds but not in
this world
I think I could argue that all right so
a monotonically non-increasing function
is a function that never gets bigger so
you couldn't have been a case where you
hit some point like say zero error and
you keep going so why wouldn't that
happen here here's the argument you
ready sure there are a finite number of
configurations there have to be a finite
number of configurations because there's
a finite number of objects and there's a
finite number of labels they can have
and once you've chosen a label for a
bunch of the objects the centers are
defined deterministically from that
right so even though it's an infinite
space as we're tick-tocking back and
forth
if we don't move the partitions when the
center's are gonna be where they were so
the center's are quite constrained even
though it's continuous right so the only
tricky part to that is that you could
have a point that can go to either of
let's say two partitions because the
distance is the same so you have to have
some way of breaking ties such that you
always get the same answer for example I
will just say that if I'm as a point can
go to any of two partitions I will pick
whichever one has the lowest number good
idea so breaking ties consistently and
you gave a particular rule for that is
going to guarantee that we at least
don't kind of spin around not improving
right so let's see if what I just said
makes sense so tell me if you buy this
they have a finite number of
configurations if I always break ties
consistently and I never go into a
configuration with the higher error then
at some point basically I will never
repeat configurations I'll never go back
to a configuration I was at before and
at some point I have to run out of
configurations because they're finally
yeah yeah I see then so it converges in
finite time unless finite time could it
be exponential time because there is a
lot of possible partitions so how many
different configurations are there there
K to the N because you can assign K to
the first object K the second object K T
the third object so K times K times K
times K comes okay all the way up to n
so it's K to the N so that's a lot of
possible configurations but regardless
there's a finite number of them and I
suppose in practice it's not like you
would look at every single one of them
because you're gonna jump around very
quickly because of the way distance
metrics work
the points are close together they're
always going to be close together and so
you're never going to try assigning each
one to all possible configurations if
they're close together yeah it tends to
converge pretty fast so let's summarize
some of these properties okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
