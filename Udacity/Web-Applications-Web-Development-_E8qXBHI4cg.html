browsers HTML HTTP which is how the
browsers talk to the servers and now
we're finally going to get to servers
which is what most of this course is
going to be about how to run programs on
servers the purpose of a server is to
respond HTTP requests we've drawn this
picture a couple of times now this is
you this is your computer running your
browser and these are our servers these
little pink boxes your browser is
speaking HTTP to these servers to
request documents there are two main
classifications for the type of
responses the server will do they are
called
static and dynamic content is considered
static if it's a pre-written file that
the server just returns an example would
be an image most images are static
requests all the server does is says it
looks up the image off of its hard disk
or off of its cash and just sends it
over the wire using HTTP more
interesting requests our dynamic
requests these are requests where the
response is built on the fly by a
program that's running just about all
the content online these days is dynamic
that didn't always used to be the case
when the web was first invented in the
early 90s almost all the content online
was static there were just files people
would edit the files put them on their
servers and they all linked to one
another but that was that these days
almost every website including Udacity
Reddit and Hipmunk the two websites that
I worked on Wikipedia Facebook all of
those pages almost 100% of them are
built dynamically on the fly by programs
called web applications and a web
application is just a program that
generates content and that is what we're
going to learn how to build in this
course so we spent all of this time
getting to this description of what a
web application does which is it lives
on a web server
it speaks HTTP and it generates content
that your browser requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
