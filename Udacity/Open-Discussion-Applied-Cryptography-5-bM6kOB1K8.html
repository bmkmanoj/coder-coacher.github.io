discussion question posted in the
homework one to review Alice wants to
send a message to Bob using a one-time
pad to what Bob no yes or no if she's
gonna be taking CS 387 and they're
worried about Mallory who can who could
possibly intercept the message and then
change a round message so the Bob would
get the wrong message and we saw in the
question that Mallory could whatever she
intercept she can't tell whether
cheshire know but she can XOR it with
the difference between yes and no and
that will flip the answer and some of
the suggested solutions were to change
yes and no two other things thinking
there was something special about yes
and no that those could be flipped but
you can flip anything and you're
flipping it by X or a.m. with a
difference whatever was there was either
yes or no exhort with some key you don't
know the key but X noring that with the
difference of them will cancel out the
wise or if this was an end it would
cancel out the ends and leave the why so
whatever message was it can be exhorted
with a difference there's nothing
special about y or n it would work let's
say if you replaced it with yes and not
the difference is just Mallory would
exhort with X or of yes and not so all
the solutions that were ideas about
changing the content don't really solve
anything Mallory knows the two options
connects or than and can flip the
content there are some other approaches
that that had better success though
there was a two main styles for example
of Steve Krenzel from Seattle suggested
using kind of more advanced crypto tools
he wanted to append announced to the
message and then hash the entire message
so i think what II was suggestion which
which is a good solution to this is to
take the yes or no so you're still
giving the response you're going to
concatenate that with an on switch is
just some random value will call it art
this is a long random Val
and then concatenate that with a hash of
the Y whatever the answer was with the
knots and we haven't talked about hash
functions yet in unit 1 but we do talk
about them in unit 2 and the hash
function is just a function that takes
some input and maps it in a complex and
unpredictable way to some other value
and that's useful because Bob can't
predict what this value is without
knowing what the value of artists and if
the value of R is random and not knowing
to Bob there's no way for Bob to predict
the output of this hash if he tries to
change this well there's no way to
change it in a way that knows the
difference between what the result would
be if this was an N and when it was a
while so Bob could flip these bits but
then the hash value wouldn't be correct
and sorry now there you could flip these
bits then the hash value wouldn't be
correct and Bob would know that it was
wrong so this is a reasonable way to do
it the difficulty with the solution is
well it involves cryptographic tools
that are much more complex than just X
or hash functions are things we'll talk
about in the next unit but involve a
fair amount of computation it's not
something you can easily do by hand what
we want is some solution that would
allow Alice and Bob to do this without
using any more advanced cryptographic
tools yeah thanks TIA the other style
solutions was a one proposed by astor
cat which involves sending a number of
dashes you maybe eight or sixteen just
ashes in a row and then randomly picking
one character just set to wire in and
then what are your thoughts on that ok
so this this is a really interesting
ideas so we're going to take instead of
sending just one character we've got a
string of eight dashes and we're
randomly going to pick one of those and
replace it with either the wire then
that's going to be the answer and now
this means when Mallory intercepts it if
she doesn't know which one was randomly
picked well she can X our out the
difference between a wire end from any
one of these eight but if she picks the
wrong one she's going to change a dash
into something else and I don't know
what it would be we'd have to look at
the numbers but it's not going to be a
dash anymore and so involve looks is the
result it's going to look wrong Bob will
know the mess
was tampered with its only if Mallory
was lucky enough to guess the right one
to flip that she could change the answer
and her probability of guessing it
correctly is one over the number of
positions here so if we have a she
hasn't won any chance of guessing the
right one and flipping that one the
other times when she doesn't guess
correctly she'll get caught so this is
pretty good this has nice property means
if we make a message long enough we can
make Mallory's success probability as
low as that we want but we need a really
long message if we want her success to
be less than one in 256 we need a string
that's 256 bytes long which not a big
deal but is less elegant we could get a
similar property with a shorter message
is if instead of having only one of them
depend on the choice we make a short
message where each of the characters in
the message depends on the yes or no
value but Alice ramli pics either to
send a wife or a one if answer is yes or
to send an energy row so let's say those
are the four choices so she's going to
randomly pick if the answer is why she's
going to send something like why why one
wife randomly picking for each position
whether to send a wire one when Mallory
intercepts this the X or between y NN is
different from the X or between 1 and 0
those two are not equal so for Mallory
to flip an answer she's gotta guess
whether it was a wire a 10 or a 1 or 0
and she can guess and flip one if she
guesses them all correctly well then she
could flip them all and Bob would see
the wrong answer but if she guess is one
wrong then Bob will see one of the
characters and the string doesn't match
and so now Mallory's property Mallory's
probability of guessing them all correct
is one half to the power of how many
there are so if there were four
characters they be one-half to the
fourth or one sixteenth but this is a
much lower success probability than we
had having the string of dashes where
mallory only had to guess one position
correctly out of that whole length now
she's got a guess each position
correctly
with one half chance for each time so
this just involves Alice picking
randomly so we did need to add something
beyond the one-time pad Alice has to be
able to flip a coin or some other sorts
of random is to decide whether to send
the Y or the one for each of these four
positions or more positions if she wants
the success probably will you be lower
than than one-half to the four could you
also do like a lowercase Y and like a
tea for true a nice to you you could
yeah so probably what you'd have to be
careful about if you did a lowercase
wine a lowercase n it's the difference
the XOR those might be the same as the
difference between the uppercase
Hawaiian the pre-k send i would guess if
you did true and false those would be
different but if you should be careful
and know that the XOR is not the same
but as long as the XOR is different that
each bite Mallory has just one half
chance of making it changed in the right
way ok I think that's all we have cool
so thanks for joining office hours and
thanks for all the discussion that
looked like we got a lot of good
responses the open discussion questions
so hopefully we'll see that again in
homework to thank you ok thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
