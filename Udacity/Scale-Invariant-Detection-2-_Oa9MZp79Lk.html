two different regions how do I actually
figure out what scale to look at this
looks good for finding an edge here
doesn't work for this one I can keep
growing it
Oh at this point it does thus of course
it's possible that computationally an
interesting challenge if I have to do
this a lot the problem is how do we
chose the corresponding circles for both
of them and of course that could be
computationally a challenging task we
can do brute force search methods and
stuff like that but remember there's
another problem associated with it not
just the fact that I need to do this but
the fact is the dish region could have
other bits of information that is not
there you know so in essence me matching
this to this I don't have the full
picture there I just have the full
picture at this point so we need to kind
of start thinking about what kind of a
match it would be also again if I now
start kind of zooming out of this one so
let's see what happens of course all of
a sudden it was only a match at this
scale not at the other scale when i zoom
out so again it's not guaranteed I can
scale out on this one it matches but
when I scale out now this doesn't match
anymore so basically you have to choose
the scale of the best corner and stick
with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
