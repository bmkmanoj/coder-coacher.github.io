exploration Dean just described first we
should use the set seed function to make
this reproducible running this one line
of code will also allow you to see the
same households in my explorations if
you use the same seed number now let's
sample 16 of the households from our
yogurt dataset from yogurt ID notice
that I'm sampling from the levels
because those are all the different
households that I have I'll run the code
for the sample IDs and then I'll print
out the sample IDs
there's the 16 of them now we can plot
each purchase occasion for each of the
households that we sampled we have the
time of the purchase the price per item
of the yogurt and the number of items
here I'm using the size parameter to add
more detail to my plot I'm passing that
the all purchases variable so that way I
can consider the number of items in
terms of size of the point on the plot
so before I run this code I want you to
take a minute to think about what type
of plot this code will produce you made
it want to pause for a moment and give
yourself some time to think now you
might also notice this new syntax here
this percent in % this just tells us to
loop over the IDS so that we go through
and create a panel plot for each ID of
our households and here's the plot
notice how we get panels for each of the
households that we had in our sample
from these plots we can see the
variation in how often each household
buys yogurt here a lot and here not so
much and it seems that some household
purchases more quantities than others
with these larger circles indicating
that here for most of the households the
price of yogurt holds steady or tends to
increase over time now there are of
course some exceptions like in this
household and in this household and even
here we might think that the household
is using coupons to drive the price down
now we don't have the coupon data to
associate with this buying data but you
can see how that information can be
paired to this data to better understand
the consumer behavior so now let's have
you do something similar your task is to
create a similar plot and provide your
own insights for another set of 16
houses
I'd like you to create a discussion post
that includes your seed number in the
title and in the post you can include an
image of your plot in any observations
that you make you may want to try the
for a few households to get a better
feel for the data in the plot there
won't be any solution video here so we'd
love to hear from you all and see you
all discuss what's going on in the
discussions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
