get ready you can describe a tree in
terms of levels or how many connections
it takes to reach the root plus one the
root is level one and nodes directly
connected to it are on level two nodes
in a tree are often described as having
a parent-child relationship in this
system a node at a lower level is a
parent and the node connected to it at a
higher level is a child a node in the
middle can be both a parent and a child
it depends what it's being compared to
keep in mind that this isn't a real
family tree where children all have two
parents here children are only allowed
to have one parent if a parent has
multiple children those children are
considered siblings of each other you
can talk about ancestry in a similar way
a node at a lower level can be called an
ancestor of a node at a higher level
which is the descendant the nodes at the
end that don't have any children are
called leaves or external nodes a parent
node is called an internal node you can
call connections edges and a group of
connections taken together as a path the
height of a node is the number of edges
between it and the furthest leaf on the
tree a leaf has a height of 0 but the
parent of a leaf has a height of 1 the
height of a tree overall is just the
height of the root node on the flip side
the depth of a node is the number of
edges to the root height and depth
should move inversely if a node is
closer to a leaf then it's further from
the root you glad that's over with time
to learn some more about trees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
