need to be done as soon as possible
while the stores do not write to memory
until commit we said we need the
load/store queue so that we can supply
the values from stores to loads this
load/store queue or lsq is a structure
just like the rob meaning we put things
there in order and remove them at commit
but we only put load and store
instructions there so there is a bit
that says which instruction do we have
load or store there is a field for what
is the address this instruction is
accessing and there is a feel for the
value that the instruction should be
storing or loading there is also a field
for this instruction has been completed
now let's suppose we have this program
and suppose that the loss of queue is
initially empty so as we said things are
going to be placed here in program order
so the first instruction here is going
to be allowed let's say that we quickly
compute the address in its 100 for this
load because there are no previous
stores will go to memory the next
instruction here is a store let's say
that it computes the address of 204
let's say that the value is 15 and we
mark it down and let's say that this
instruction is kind of delayed so it
doesn't return yet so we still have all
of these in the lobster queue the next
load let's say it eventually computes
the address of 204 for every load when
it computes the address we check in the
load/store queue if any store matches
that address if there is no matching
store like equals case for this load
because there were no stores we go to
memory if there is a matching store we
do not go to memory instead we do what
is called the store to load forwarding
where you simply take the value from the
store and that is the value that the
load produces and we never go to memory
so again this is called store to load
forwarding now of course this assumes
that at the time we want to do this load
the stores have already be
completed and we now know what the
addresses are and if we need to get the
value we know what the value is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
