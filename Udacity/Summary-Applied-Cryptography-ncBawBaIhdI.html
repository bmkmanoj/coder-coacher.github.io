unit five we've seen several examples of
authentication protocols and focused on
TLS as the most widely used protocol
that's used for every secure web session
so the first thing I hope you take away
from this is that designing
cryptographic protocols is really hard
the details matter and that way things
are implemented matters TLS is a
protocol that's built on SSL that's been
around for over 17 years still has new
vulnerabilities being discovered and
people learning new ways to exploit them
the other key lesson is a tax get better
they never get worse even if the initial
attack seems to be only theoretical and
not be easy to exploit they're often
ways that clever people will figure out
ways to exploit those attacks in unit 6
we'll look at other things you can do
with cryptographic protocols this unit
focused all on authentication and
communication but there are lots and
lots of other things we can do with
cryptography some of those are quite
interesting and I hope you'll be back
for unit 6 to learn about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
