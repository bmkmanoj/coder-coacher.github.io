sanders and Mark pointed out that
regular expressions are very powerful in
their useful tool but they can quickly
become really long and hard to read he
wants to know are these two are there
tools that we can use online that maybe
would help us generate these longer
regular expressions and if there are
would they be useful so there's a lot
you can do as regular expressions and
I've seen regular expressions that are
two or three lines of just non-stop
characters and special symbols and
whatnot and at that point I have to say
it's usually more useful that you break
it up into smaller regular expressions
that you connect together with code
there's not a whole lot of value and
it's very hard to debug regular
expressions that are really wrong long
that do like your entire program and one
go but there are tools that help you
generate but more importantly check your
regular expressions there are tools that
you just give a text and you type in
your rate of expression and I'll
highlight everything in that text that
it matches and that's really useful for
creating great expressions and I highly
recommend them if you combine them okay
