the system component is responsible for
causing the input to be read in causing
it to be parsed into pieces getting
storing those pieces into the line and
word data structures and organizing the
index okay and then calling the circular
shifter do its thing and then ultimately
calling sort of do his thing now
sometimes when you put a lot of
responsibility for organizing steps and
behavior and algorithms inside of one
piece you might want to break that piece
into into parts so this particular
solution is similar to parnassus
approach which he called the shared data
decomposition what we're going to break
the system into components based upon
the functions they compute and all
components share access to the data
which is stored in memory so you have a
component several data structure
components which are then accessible to
the circular shorter sorter and to the
circular shifter and into this order and
this solution solutions like this
typically contain some form of what's
called a master controller routine which
you have you've labeled it systems and
it's responsible for invoking the others
and knowing what steps are in the
process okay and that the typically in a
situation like this control flow
dependencies is are organized or
realized by function calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
