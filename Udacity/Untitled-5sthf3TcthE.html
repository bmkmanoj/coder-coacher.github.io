the interview he was able to make sure
that he was communicating what he was
thinking all the time so I never worried
that he had no idea what was going on he
went into great depth when I asked him a
question and he was usually on point
with runtimes and thinking about how
much space things take up so the three
things he did well where he was great at
making sure was communicating his
thoughts being very specific about run
times and memory space and I'd say the
third thing that he did really well was
when needed he put out a diagram and
made sure it was very clear what he was
saying things that I think he could have
done better where I think he he needed
his testing on the first question and
the fact that he wasn't using the syntax
of a testing library would show to an
interviewer that he hasn't written that
many tests potentially so using the
actual syntax of Python testing library
would be one thing they'll be important
number two would be making sure he has
run times of basic things like using
data structures he ended up being fine
in the end and you ended up driving the
right runtime but making sure that's
down pat is something interviewer is
usually looking are looking for and I'd
say the last thing is as a full-stack
candidate companies are usually looking
for people who can not only work in the
back end with Phillip clearly shows you
can do but also work on the front end
well also i think at the end of the
google question where Phillip said not
too sure about how the rendering works
that would indicate that he's more
back-end leaning and a real really
really strong force that candidate would
have been able to do that part as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
