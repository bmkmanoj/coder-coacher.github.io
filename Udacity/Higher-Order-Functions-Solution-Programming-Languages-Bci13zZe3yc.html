we wanted to find the odd numbers in
that list one way to do this is to use
list comprehensions as we learned
earlier in the class here the list of
odds is only going to be the values of n
where n is an element in numbers and
that n is odd which is what this
statement results in we can also use the
same construction to turn this list of
numbers until a list of squares of each
number these types of operations are so
common in computer science we give them
a name this is usually referred to as a
filter and this a map when we're
filtering we take in a list of numbers
and some criteria and only return the
numbers that satisfy that criteria in a
mapping we take a list of elements and
some operation and we perform that
operation on each element Python
actually gives us built-in functions to
do this so another way to write odds is
to use the built-in function filter
where we give in to arguments the first
is a function that we create anonymously
using the lambda notation that returns
true or false true if n is odd and false
is n is even the second parameter is the
numbers and so filter is going to return
all the numbers that when input it into
our first parameter this function return
true here's how we generate the squares
using the map operation we pass in two
parameters just like we did with filter
for the first one is a function the
second one is a list and map returns a
new list that is the result of applying
each element in numbers to the first
parameter that we gave the function this
problem asks us to create what is known
as a higher-order function that is we're
going to create a function that
generates a function that saves us time
from having to repeat this first part of
the filter and the map every time we
want to use the same operation so
ideally instead of writing filter of
lambda n n mod 2 equals equals 1 we're
just going to create an odd filter here
our filter maker creates a new function
that takes in
one parameter numbers and applies filter
in the same way as we have up here
because we've already passed in to the
filter maker the function that we want
to use filter on there are two ways you
can solve this the first would be using
the lambda notation and the second is
using inline function defines here we're
creating a function using lambda that's
what lambda does it's a function that
creates a function that is a lifts
comprehension where for every element in
our list which is the one parameter into
our lambda function L we're going to
leave it in the new function created by
this list comprehension if that element
satisfies our function f in this
alternative solution i'm using a nested
function declaration where we're
creating a function that takes in the
list and returns the result of filter of
the original function that we use to
create our special filter F and the list
that we just passed into this function
so that's how we do this for filter
let's do the same thing for map and just
like before we can solve this in two
ways first we'll go over how to do it
with lambda and then we'll briefly go
over how to do it with a function and
decoration here I'm creating a function
that is just a list comprehension that
returns the result of applying each
element in l2 function f in this
alternative solution we're defining a
function your map that simply returns
the result of using pythons built-in map
with parameters F and the list that is
passed in with applying your map and the
last line is returning the mapping
function we created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
