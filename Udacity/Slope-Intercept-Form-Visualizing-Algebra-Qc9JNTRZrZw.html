slope-intercept form so first I'm going
to add 2x to both sides because I want
to isolate y i get negative 3y equals 6
plus 2x and i could rewrite this side by
switching the terms around then i divide
each term by negative 3 2 get 1 y is
equal to negative two-thirds X minus 2
notice I have one negative sign here and
one negative sign here so both of these
terms need to be negative all right now
I'm ready to graph I know my y-intercept
is at negative 2 so I go two units down
on the y-axis I know my slope is
negative two thirds I'm going to put the
negative sign with the two which means I
move down two units and right three
units if I move down two units and right
three units I end up here at this point
this wasn't one of the boxes down here
so these are out we could continue
moving two units down and three units
right to get other points down in this
region so I have two points and I know
my line should look like this but how do
I get the other points up here well I
assign the negative to the two what if I
put the negative instead with the three
in this case the two would be positive
and I would move up two and the three
would be negative and I would move left
three if I start from my y-intercept and
move two units up and three units left I
end up at this point here when working
with slope the positive and negative
signs always indicate the directions we
need to move two points determine the
line and the third one is like our
insurance so if i connect these I should
get a line so here's the line that
represents our linear equation pretty
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
