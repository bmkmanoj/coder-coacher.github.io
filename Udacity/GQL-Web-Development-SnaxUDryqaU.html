we've been talking about sequel and in
the App Store we've got something a
little different it's called G equal G
QL and it's basically a simplified
version of SQL that works only in the
data store and the main difference is
all queries begin with select star so
there's no way to select individual
columns so this actually simplifies a
lot of queries we can do for example we
can't do joints which is why I didn't
want to spend a whole lot of time on
joins earlier you know what even if I
were working in a sequel database I
probably wouldn't be doing a whole lot
of joints and in the App Engine data
store we won't be doing any joints
whatsoever because it's not possible
when we're using gql actually we don't
even have to use gql at all the data
store has a kind of a procedural
language you could use as well but since
we spent all this time practicing sequel
and you'll probably use it elsewhere in
your career we're gonna use G equal you
know for this example so so we can at
least have some consistency there
another another difference is in the
kind of generic sequel databases we've
been talking about you know you can run
arbitrary queries no matter how slow
with or without indices and in App
Engine all queries must be indexed this
is this is important because you know
when you're running your own database
you can do whatever you want but you
know Google it's very nice of them to
give us this whole system for free at
least for small use cases but we can't
we can't beat their machines to death
all the queries must be indexed it's
actually not just so we you know we
don't beat them to death but it's just
the way the whole system is built and as
you get more familiar with it it'll kind
of make sense why why things are
designed the way they're so for the most
part in this example that I'm gonna
build and your homework you won't
actually have to build any indices
yourself Google App Engine will actually
build the indices for you which is
really handy if you want to control over
what indices they built yes you can do
that yourself and sometimes it might
build a you know not the most efficient
index and and you can you know define
your own so that's pretty cool as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
