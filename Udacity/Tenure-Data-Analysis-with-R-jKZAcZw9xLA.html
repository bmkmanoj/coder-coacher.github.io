variables so we can better understand
our users and our sample dataset this
time I'm going to examine the
distribution of tenure or how many days
someone has been using Facebook I'm also
going to start introducing color to jazz
up our plots a little bit to do that I'm
gonna use the color and the fill
parameter now I'm not gonna explain this
code in detail check out the instructor
notes for an explanation of this code
there's also a link to GG plots themes
to learn about all the different
adjustments besides color that you could
make now if this code is throwing you
for a loop I don't want you to focus on
it too much you can really just ignore
it I'll typically include it as the
second line of parameters inside of Q
plot running this code we can see we get
a nice histogram and again here the
histogram is defaulted to an automatic
bin width I'm gonna make one last
adjustment and set it for ourselves by
setting the bin width equal to 30 we can
see we get a finer view of the
distribution let's see if you have a
handle on histograms and bin width we're
gonna see if you can change the
distribution and this next programming
exercise in it you're going to be
creating a histogram of tenured that's
measured in years rather than in days
you'll also want to think about an
appropriate bin width for the data 30
here makes sense since I'm measuring
days and 30 days is about a month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
