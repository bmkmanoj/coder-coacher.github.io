taken a mechanism that is typically used
in distributed systems namely RPC and we
ask the question suppose we want to use
our PC as a structuring mechanism in a
multiprocessor
how to make that efficient so that the
designers of services will in fact use
RPC as a vehicle for building these
services and the reason why you want to
promote that is because when you put
every service in its own protection
domain you're building safety into the
system and that is very important for
the integrity of an operating system as
an operating system designer we worry
about the integrity of services and we
can provide that integrity by putting
every service in its own protection
domain and we're making RPC cheap enough
that you would use as a structuring
mechanism we are promoting a software
engineering practice of building
services in seven separate protection
domains</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
