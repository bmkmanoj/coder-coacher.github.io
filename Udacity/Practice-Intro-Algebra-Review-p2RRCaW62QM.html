normal division 1/2 well let's see 2
doesn't go into 1 at all
0 times 2 is 0 2 goes into 10 five times
don't forget the decimal right 1 divided
by 2 is 0.5 now how do we get from 0.5
to 50% well let's see the reason why 0.5
equals 50% is because percent means per
100 in fact cent is a prefix meaning 100
century is a hundred years the word song
is 100 in French so percent really means
out of 100 per cent
so this statement really says is that
0.5 equals 50 out of 100 that's what
this symbol means out of 100 so what
this means is that if you can write a
number as something over 100 then that
something is your percent just like 50
out of 100 is 50 percent now a trick is
that to convert from decimals to
percents we just move the decimal point
two places to the right so in the case
of zero point five we move this decimal
place one two and actually we have to
put a zero there so now instead of the
decimal being here it's over here it's
50% and there's a little decimal place
we could think of being there can you
practice this by converting the
following numbers from decimals to
percent for each these four numbers
right the corresponding percentage over
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
