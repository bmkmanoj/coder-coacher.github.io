so I think a couple of things let me
just sort of talk this out loud so we're
trying to learn incrementally we're
trying to figure out how if we just kind
of keep adding these random variables
and sort of weighted way you described
before what we would end up at so why do
we want to choose alpha tea with the
particular kind of property well if you
look at it it's clear that alpha tee at
each time step is moving closer and
closer to zero so it means you start out
learning a lot and you sort of believe
things less and less and less or you let
things change you less and less and less
over time so what is that likely to end
up at well the first thing I noticed
that well if it's going to do that then
it has to converge at some point it just
makes sense so I that helps me to
eliminate the second answer but actually
that also lets me eliminate the fourth
answer because in some ways that says
the same thing so that leaves us with
the expected value of X and the expected
value of x squared or the expected value
of x squared or whichever one it is that
is variance okay so I'm gonna go with
the expected value of X so the expected
value of x right so so it turns out that
this is actually a way of computing the
average by just you know repeatedly
sampling and updating your values and
and the way to think about it is that
sometimes the X values that we draw are
going to be a bit above the average and
it's gonna pull the V value up sometimes
it's a little bit below the average and
it's gonna pull the value down but in
the limit those all those pulls and
pushes are going to cancel out and it's
going to settle in on the actual average
value of the expected value of this
random variable right because in
principle you're gonna see an infinite
number of those things and effectively
all you're doing is adding them all up
and then sort of you know
well you're effectively average and then
one little bit at a time yeah that's a
good way to think about it that in fact
it's adding adding them up and it's
computing a weighted average but the
weights are these alphas and the weights
are decaying over time so we're gonna
put more weight on the more recent ones
but some weight on the further away ones
but it sort of doesn't matter because
the order this since we're drawing these
iid the order doesn't matter and the
thing that it has to converge to is the
mean right I like it so let's relate
that back to what we do in q-learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
