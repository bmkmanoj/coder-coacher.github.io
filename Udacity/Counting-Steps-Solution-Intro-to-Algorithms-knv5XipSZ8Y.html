function looking again count down of n
well whatever n is it's going to call
count down with that variable it's going
to do some statements it's gonna repeat
this how many times well as X is
counting down by five so it's going to
keep doing this until it gets to be zero
or less well how many times is that
going to be it's like whatever this X is
which is really whatever this n is
divided by five but rounded up because
if you have something like six X is
gonna be six it's gonna do this loop X
is gonna get decremented to one come
back up here it's still greater than
zero so it's gonna do it again the only
way that it wouldn't have done that if
it was exactly five we put five in it
executes it once
subtract five away from it end up with
zero it falls through it doesn't repeat
the loop at that point what we really
want here is to take n divided by five
and round it up and this math dot
sealing function does that it rounds non
integer number up to the nearest integer
so that's the number of times that these
two statements are going to be executed
so we multiply that by two and then
there's three other statements that are
going to get executed this print
statement this print statement and this
initialization of the Y variable so this
formula will actually tell us the number
of steps as a function of n that this
countdown will do and what is it it
really is roughly and divided by five
times two plus a constant essentially
linear in n here's the actual formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
