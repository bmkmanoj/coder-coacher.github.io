the data access connectors and this is
as the name indicates this is where the
connector is responsible for dealing
with access to some kind of data
repository hence there's a communication
service provided
moreover the data access connector may
provide some kind of translation
services could be character set
translation or something at a higher
level hence there's an a conversion
service being provided some of the
variations and data access connectors
include locality that is are the
connectors specific to a particular
thread or to a particular process or are
they global what kinds of access are
allowed is it's simply query retrievals
or might there be changes allowed what's
the availability of the data access is
it transient is it persistent that is
could it be long lasting as with the
earlier connectors accessibility in
terms of private protected or public
with respect to life cycle who is
responsible for doing the construction
or building and who's responsible for
cleaning up when things are over thank
you your constructors and destructors as
far as cardinality is concerned who
who's responsible for defining the
messages and who's responsible for
receiving them are using them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
