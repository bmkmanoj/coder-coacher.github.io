propagation to do so we'll take a
specific example from computer vision
here is an example of a 2d image
composed of a large number of pixels the
grayness at any one pixel is a depiction
of the intensity of light at that pixel
of course you and I can immediately
recognize that this is the cube but how
do we do it and how can we make a
machine to it mar decompose the task of
3d object recognition into several
subtasks Mars said that in the first
subtask the visual system detects edges
or lines as shown here at this
particular point no surface have been
detected and this particular point no 3d
object has been recognized just these
pixels have been grouped into lines
based on the intensities of light at
different pixels according to Mar the
second sub task of object recognition
consists of grouping these lines into
surfaces with orientations as indicated
here so now these four lines have been
grouped into this surface with an
orientation defined by the perpendicular
to the surface and similarly these four
lines and these four lines and it third
and final phase of the object
recognition task aconitum our surfaces
are grouped into a complete 3d object at
this particular point the visual system
recognizes that this is a cube mar
theory has been very influential in
computer vision it has actually also
been influential in AI as a whole one of
the lessons we can take away from our
theory of computer vision of object
recognition is that before we get into
algorithms for addressing a task we want
to understand how a task gets decomposed
into subtasks throughout this course we
have emphasized task decomposition
repeatedly as an example when we were
talking about understanding the big task
of understanding or decomposed into a
series of small tasks where surface
level cues acted as probes into memory
and a frame was retrieved these slots
are the frames generated expectations
lexical and grammatical analysis led to
the identification of objects and
predicates that would satisfy those
expectations and if fillers were put in
problem reduction certainly is a
general-purpose method for decomposing
complex tasks into smaller tasks this
notion of task decomposition is a
powerful idea irrespective of what
algorithm we use for any of the specific
subtasks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
