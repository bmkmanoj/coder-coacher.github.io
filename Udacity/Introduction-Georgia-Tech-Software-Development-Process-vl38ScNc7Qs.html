motivate the need for very fine software
the first example I want to use is the
famous Ariane 5 and if you remember
that's a rocket that exploded
not too long after departure because of
a software error and even without going
to such dramatic examples I'm sure
you're all familiar with this kind of
situation or this one or again at this
one and here I'm not really picking on
any specific organization operating
system or software the point I want to
make is that software is buggy in fact a
federal report from a few years ago
assess that software bugs are costing
the US economy sixty billion dollars
every year in addition studies have
shown the software contains on average
one to five bugs every thousand lines of
code building 100% correct
mass-market software is just impossible
and if this is the case what can we do
what we need to do is to verify software
as much as possible in this part of the
course we will discuss how we can do
this we will discuss different
alternative ways of very fine software
systems with particular attention to the
most common type of verification which
is software testing before doing that
however let me go over some basic terms
that are commonly used and have to say
often misused in the context of software
verification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
