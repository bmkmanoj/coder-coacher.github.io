we actually we didn't transport you in
anything we're giving you the ability to
interact with an MDP and here's the MD
feed now remember I said the MDP or the
environment has States and actions the
states in this case are going to be
visualized to you in terms of this sort
of Mondrian looking picture in the
middle of the screen
Mondrian I'm gonna go with that okay and
you know it's like colors and squares
and things and the actions are the
numbers 1 through 6 and unlike in a
regular video game you don't know the
rules you don't really know how things
work you don't even know what it is
you're trying to do but what you can do
is start playing and use that experience
to start figuring out how things work ok
so it's just like grad school maybe
alright so you have to now choose
actions and I'll enter them into the MDP
and we'll see what happens and then you
can see if you can win or not ok uh 3
hmm 3 I did it nothing changed 5 I did
it nothing changed 6 huh
I'm back where I was that's true hmm 1 I
think changed to 3 that's a new state it
is interstate well so I figured
something out then tell me what it is
nope I forgot what I did steps back
I've decided that three means move to
the right ok and something moves down
but I can't remember what I said I want
to say it was two but I guess I could
try that too
yes now I need to figure out to go back
up again one happened 4 4 4 5
nothing happened six so I think that's
visually very attractive thank you cool
so I think I can know how to I think my
actions
mostly move the orange square around and
now I just need to know what it's trying
to accomplish how about two two two two
five six nothing happened 4 4 3 3 3 2 2
3 1 4 4 4 4 all right so you seem to
have at least gotten a feel for the idea
that there's four directional actions
for the orange square yeah
in fact maybe we should actually notate
them just to make it a little easier to
hold in your head okay but you do notice
that there are some actions that you
haven't quite gotten to do anything yet
yeah and now that I don't have to
remember what they are I mean sure 2 3 4
&amp;amp; 6 map exactly as you would expect them
to - down right up and left but I was
having a hard time keeping them in my
head so let's try 6 6 2 2 6 6 4 4
one nothing happened three hmm six five
oh the little yellow circle thingy Green
is good okay the green little circle
thingy shrunk oh three oh that's
interesting
two two three three three four four I
should do something now one success yes
I get it I think I even understand what
the game is
okay well let's let's show you the game
again and maybe you can explain it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
