these software phases these software
activities and can support software
development tasks in general and this is
something that where I will repeat over
and over in the class tools and
automation are fundamental in software
engineering and they're fundamental for
improving productivity not only
efficiency but also effectiveness of our
activities in the software development
process so let me go back to one of the
diagrams that I showed you before if you
remember we had this qualitative diagram
in which we were showing that one of the
issues that led to the software crisis
was the fact that developers
productivity was not able to keep up
with the software size and complexity
with the growth in the importance and
complexity of software what tools can
help us to do is to change this and
basically move this curve from this
original position up here so that it
gets closer and closer to what we need
to develop the software that we need to
build so let me discuss some examples of
how tools can improve productivity for
example if we're talking about
development think about what kind of
improvement was to go from punch cards
to modern ideas
if we're talking about languages think
about how much more productive
developers became when going from
writing machine code to writing code in
high-level languages and finally if we
talk about debugging which is a very
important and expensive activity moving
from the use of print lines to the use
of symbolic debuggers dramatically
improved the effectiveness and the
efficiency of development and these are
just some of the tools that we will
discuss in the rest of the class and
notice that we will also use the tools
in practice so we will use the tools
both for our projects and also during
the lessons and for assignments in
particular we will use three main kinds
of tools the first type is IDs and I'm
pretty sure you're familiar with IDs
these are integrated development
environments so advanced editors in
which you can write compile run and
debug and even test your code we'll also
use a version control systems systems
that allow you to save and restore and
check the differences between different
versions of the code in particular we
will be working with git we will also
look at other kinds of tools like
coverage and verification tools these
are tools that can help you during
testing and I'm a big fan of these tools
so I'm really gonna stress the
usefulness of these tools and how you
should use them in your development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
