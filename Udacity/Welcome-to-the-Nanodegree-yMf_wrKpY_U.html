Julia a project manager here at Udacity
I will be guiding you through your first
steps in learning more about DevOps
DevOps developed organically from people
who are at the forefront of developing
software for the Internet
these people came from all different
types of backgrounds some might have a
similar background to you and some might
be completely different but they all had
a single goal to improve collaboration
and efficiency throughout their
organizations DevOps is a practice that
emerge from agile development and lean
management one thing all of these
systems have in common is continuous
improvement DevOps is not just about
buying software or holding a one-day
training it's a journey that will take
time effort and commitment you'll need
to balance the needs of many different
groups within your organization as you
implement wide scale cultural changes
while it's up to you to take the first
steps we will be here to support and
guide you along the way in the process
we'll look at tools that can help you
manage some of the technical challenges
although DevOps won't magically solve
all of your problems following DevOps
practices will help your team to improve
collaboration and workflow throughout
the whole software development lifecycle
DevOps did not become popular because
somebody forced its adoption it's
popular because it works and it makes
teams and companies more successful
excited to learn more let's jump in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
