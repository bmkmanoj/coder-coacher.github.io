textile covered too many pixels we could
just make our original checkered texture
larger and larger so that about one
texel covered one pixel with
minification we like each pixel to cover
no more than one texel the GPU has built
into its special functionality that
implements an algorithm called MIT
mapping with MIT mapping the GPU
computes approximately what the Texel -
pixel ratio is if this ratio is less
than one magnification happens in the
mag filter takes effect if this ratio is
greater than 1 min efficacious is
happening this is where MIT mapping
comes in what the GPU does is determines
the ratio of texels to pixels if this
ratio gets much larger than 1 to 1 a
lower resolution version of the texture
is used instead as this ratio gets
higher and higher a lower and lower
resolution of the texture gets used
these textures can be thought of as
forming a pyramid for example say a
pixel needs the texture color instead of
taking whatever Texel happens to cover
the center of the pixel down at the
bottom level the GPU determines the
Texel to pixel ratio for this pixel to
see how high up the pyramid to go the
texture at this level of the pyramid is
then sampled since the ratio of texels
to pixels is about 1 to 1 for this lower
resolution texture the rendering looks
much better without the noise we saw
before in fact for even better quality
rendering we can set the GPU to linearly
interpolate between levels this is
called trilinear filtering say our ratio
is in between two pyramid levels we then
sample the texture above and below from
where our sample is in the pyramid and
interpolate between these two samples my
example pyramid was not drawn to scale
within the GPU the pyramid is created
and stored in powers of 2 that is if you
start with a texture that's 64 by 64 the
pyramid is formed with this texture a 32
by 32 texture a 16 by 16 texture 8 by 8
4 by 4 2 by 2 and 1 by 1 at the end this
set of textures is called the MIT matte
pyramid or the MIT map chain each
smaller texture is derived from the
larger one one technique is to simply
average the 4 texels of the larger
texture to make the smaller which can be
done in advance or by the GPU itself
there are some subtleties such as gamma
correction that can change how these
levels are formed
that's for a later lesson this is an
important point so pay attention you
want to make your textures to be powers
of two in size both in rows and columns
you will not be able to use mipmapping
if you don't GPUs generally expect
powers of two so don't disappoint them
unless you know what you're doing and
have a very good reason for doing so
give the new version of the demo a try
you can now pick mipmapping as a
filtering option for minification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
