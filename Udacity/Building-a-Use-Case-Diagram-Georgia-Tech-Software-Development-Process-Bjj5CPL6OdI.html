diagram for our example we have to add
the use cases for these different actors
for instance if we consider the student
and the register they might be both
interacting with the maintain schedule
system the register by updating the
schedule and the students by using the
schedule that has been updated by the
register as you can see different roles
for the same use case another possible
use case is the request course roster in
this case the professor will request the
roster by interacting with the system we
will continue in this way by further
refining and by further adding use cases
as we identify possible interactions of
the actors that we identified with our
system so in summary what the use case
diagram is doing is to show the actors
and their interaction with the system
through a set of use cases at this point
should be pretty clear that sure this
gives us an idea of the interactions but
we don't really know how these
interactions occur so there is one piece
that is missing which is how do we
document the use cases how do we
describe what happens and what these
interactions actually are and that's
exactly what we're going to discuss now
how to document use cases so the
behavior of a use case can be specified
by describing its flow of events and it
is important to note that the flow
events that should be described from an
actor's point of view so from the point
of view of the external entity that is
interacting with my system so the
description should detail what the
system must provide to the actor when
the use case is executed in particular
it should describe how the use case
starts and ends it should describe the
normal flow of events what is the normal
interaction and in addition to the
normal flow of events
it should also describe possibly
alternative flows of events for example
in the case in which there are multiple
ways of accomplishing one action or
performing a task and finally it should
also describe exceptional flow of events
for example assume that you're
describing a use case for withdrawing
money from an ATM you may want to
describe the normal flow event in which
I insert my card I provide my PIN and so
on an alternative one in which in
addition to withdrawing cash maybe I'll
also first ask for some information
about how much money is in my account
and finally I may want also describing a
section of flow of events in which I get
my pin wrong and therefore I'm not able
to perform the operation one more thing
I want to mention when we talk about
documenting use cases
is the fact that the description of this
information can be provided in two main
ways
in an informal way or in a formal way in
the case of an informal description we
could just have a textual description of
the flow of events in natural language
in the case of a formal structure
description we may use for example pre
and post conditions pseudocode to
indicate the steps we can also use the
sequence diagrams which is something
that we will see in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
