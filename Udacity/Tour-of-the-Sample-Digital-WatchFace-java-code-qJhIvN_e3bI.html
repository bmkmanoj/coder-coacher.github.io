sample code it's time to do a deep dive
to better understand the different parts
of making a watch face if you look at
the project in Android studio you'll see
it shares a lot in common with a regular
Android wear app in that it has a phone
project application and a wearable
project so there are built into an apk
in the same way as a wearable app you
can even bundle a watch face in with an
existing app or multiple watch faces
into the same apk like we're doing here
however one key difference is that watch
faces are actually a service there are
not activities if we look at digital
watch face service you'll see that it
extends canvas watch face service you
will also see that we define an engine
class which extends canvas watch face
service engine these classes are both
defined in the wearable support library
that you've seen earlier the first
method of interest is on create which is
called to initialize your service the
first thing we do is call set watch face
style and provide a builder of the
attributes that we want to set for our
watch face you can see that we've
selected variable size Pete cards here
we also only want Pete cards to show for
interruptive notifications and finally
we disabled the system UI time since our
watch faces during its own time
representation for us the next part of
on create is initializing resources it's
very important that you do as much of
your allocation and initialization here
as possible so setting paint styles and
loading and resizing large bitmaps
should be done here you definitely don't
want to be doing expensive operations in
the main draw code for your watch face
nor allocating and freeing objects since
that will cause the Refresh performance
to suffer the next step is the on-time
tech method this method is called an
ambient mode once every minute this is
the only time that Android wear will
call your code to update your watch face
we'll talk more about faster updates
later when you're on time tick is cold
you need to invalidate the canvas this
tells the framework that your canvas
needs to be redrawn and this is done in
the ondraw method which will be called
later the ondraw method is where all the
drawing happens for your watch face you
need to run this code very quickly since
it'll be called a lot so hopefully you
did all your prep work earlier and on
create you can see that we start by
setting our pre created calendar object
to the current system time then we start
drawing things we fill the background
with a solid color and then use the
bounds object to provide the dimensions
you should always use the bounds object
to calculate the width height or center
of the display and it'll work properly
even on devices with an inception at the
bottom this is important in the analog
watch faces where the hands must come
from the center of the display the
canvas object has many methods for
drawing draw rect here draws rectangles
draw text draws text view you can
control how this drawing is done with
the paint object provided as the last
argument these were configured in
oncreate you'll notice this use of is in
ambient mode this is used to decide
whether will render the second value or
put a.m. or PM afterwards when in
ambient mode here we have the on
properties changed method this method is
called to provide to you information
about very special display support that
you might need to implement you can see
here property burnin protection we do
not use bold font on displays that have
burning issues because the thick text
will be wider than the shifting pattern
applied to move the watch face around
you can see here we call set typeface to
implement this and here we have property
low bit ambien this tells us if the
display can only render simple colors
when in low-power mode so what else is
happening for interactive vs. ambient
mode the on ambient mode changed method
is called whenever a switch is made
between modes in the code you can see
it's changing the paint styles so they
have different colors depending on the
mood we're in we also detect if the
watch supports load bit mode if it does
we toggle the anti-aliasing flags since
that is not allowed on these watches in
ambient mode and here we call invalidate
to force a refresh after the change
otherwise we'll be stuck with the
previous display and will not match the
mode we just entered finally you'll
notice an update timer call this is
important because we need to refresh the
watch quickly when an interactive mode
but once per minute in ambient mode
let's go to the definition of em update
time handler you can see we defined a
handler earlier we call invalidate to
force a refresh and then decide if we
should schedule another update later on
if we do we set an update to occur in a
fixed number of milliseconds if we
follow the dependency we can see it is
normal update rate ms and this is 0.5
seconds so the CPU will sleep between
updates the code is written in ondraw to
draw colons for the first half of each
second giving a blinking effect if you
look at other samples like the sweep
watch face it does not use a timer and
just calls invalidate
directly from on draw this uses a lot
more CPU power but gives smoothly moving
watch hands some of the other
interesting features our support for
time zones we register a broadcast
receiver so that our service will be
notified when we change time zones this
happens more often than you think such
as when our user arrives in a new city
on an airplane you can see the code
changes the time zone of our calendar
object it then calls invalidates so that
Andhra will refresh the clock
immediately android wear automatically
propagates the time zone change that the
phone discovered to the wearable so all
you need to do is register the broadcast
receiver to find out when other changes
have been made the time zone is
retrieved here with the get default
method one other thing to note is that
you'll also need to deal with any
localization issues such as drawing the
time and date appropriately for
different languages in the same way that
you'd have to deal with this on Android
phones and tablets let's now go to on
data changed you'll notice that this
service implements a listener for
changes in data items just like we
talked about for wearable apps this is
designed to handle updates from the
configuration activities and change the
UI to reflect the desired colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
