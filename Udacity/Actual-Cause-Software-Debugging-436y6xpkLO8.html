can be misleading to think about the
window shattering we said it was the
ball that's right but it could also have
been the window maker say if the window
maker had not made this particular
window then the window would not have
shattered and if the house builder had
not built this particular house with a
window in it well the window wouldn't
have shattered either so for a single
effect there can be multiple causes and
all of these are valid according to our
earlier definition this is where the
concept of an actual cause comes in
handy an actual course assumes and
changes as little as possible but it
changes the effect if we think about the
causes we have discussed a ball
shattering the window does not change
much except for the window the window
maker not producing the window makes a
far larger different because then we
would have the house with one window
missing for quite some time which would
change a lot parts of the house would
get very wet for instance it would be
cold or hot depending on your climate if
the house maker had not built the house
the change would be even bigger so what
you want is an actual cause that assumes
and changes as little as possible which
is precisely what the ball is in here
for debugging the same hold you want to
have a course that assumes and changes
as little as possible but still produces
the effect and that's precisely what
Delta debugging gets you starting with
the general cause the entire input it
produces an actual cause namely a subset
of the input in which everything is
relevant for producing the effect here's
a quiz I invoke the glue compiler and it
crashes which of these are general
causes for the failure is it me because
no me no invocation no crash or is it
Richard Stallman the founder of the glue
project because without Stallman no glue
compiler no crash or is it oxygen
without oxygen no Richard Stallman no me
no compiler no crash probably also know
world as we know it no computers no
electricity hmm interesting Oh finally
is it a bug in the
either because new bug no crash check
all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
