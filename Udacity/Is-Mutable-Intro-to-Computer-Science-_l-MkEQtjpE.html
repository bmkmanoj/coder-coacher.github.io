try some experiments and I want to
encourage you to do all the experiments
you can think of to try to answer a
question about said and the quizzes that
we're going to have some of them in this
unit are different from the kinds of
quizzes that you had in cs101 all of
those quizzes were meant to be ones that
you could answer based on what had just
been covered but real life is not like
that most problems you face don't follow
directly from previously covered content
so many of the courses in this unit will
be different that you'll need to do some
experiments on your own maybe do some
web searches maybe read some documents
to try to figure out how to answer them
then I'll talk about how I would find
the answer to that question when I
discuss the answer not so much what the
answer is but more importantly how do
you find it so the question is is the
result of set X where X is a list a
mutable object or an immutable object
and you should remember that mutable
objects are objects whose value can
change like lists and dictionaries
immutable objects are objects whose
value doesn't change like integers and
strings so what's the result of said X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
