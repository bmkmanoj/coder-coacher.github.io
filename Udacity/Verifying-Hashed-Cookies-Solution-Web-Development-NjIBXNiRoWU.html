function first what we do is we take we
take this value H which has this format
and we split it on commas and we take
the first part of that we store that in
Val and we say if H equals make secure
Val Val return val val is is what is the
the the f part of what we passed in and
we want to make sure that if we run this
function on that value again that we get
what we passed into this function I
could have structured this differently
and looked at all of the parts of h and
then called hash store again but if we
funnel everything through make secure
Val updates of this function will be
easier going forward so because I have
the advantage of knowing what going
forward is going to look like so let's
give this a test the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to call make
secure Val on some string so we'll go
ahead and give that a run okay we've got
the string and now i'm going to copy
this and we're going to replace this
with check secure Val we're going to
pass in that string and now we should
see the output Udacity and let's see if
that's the case yes we do Udacity that
works now what happens if we if we
modify this a little bit you know we add
an extra ! and then I click run we get
nothing back because you'd asset II
didn't match the hash string likewise if
we restore our string and we change the
hash I'll just get rid of this character
and run it we still have none and I'll
add that that to back and run it again
just to make sure everything's working
and we see you dasa t ok cool nice work
let's go ahead and use these functions
in our program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
