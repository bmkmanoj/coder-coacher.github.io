involved and we have to be concerned
about transactions that is making sure
that the data that we store and retrieve
is consistent with respect to the
overall database we have to deal with
transaction processing and in particular
with what are called the acid properties
the primary concern is reliable database
access particularly when there are
multiple readers and writers that is
parts of the application reading from
the database and other parts are writing
into the database particularly on in
dressing a particular specific record
imagine that you were in a situation
maybe you are doing airline reservations
or something like that and you need to
understand the information in the
database but you also may want to update
it if you're making that reservation
okay so you have to read it examine it
change it and then write it back what
happens if another application changes
the record after you've read it but
before your changed version has been
written back so we'd like to have
database transactions that satisfy the
acid properties an acid is an acronym
the a stands for atomic that means that
your transaction these four steps
reading examining changing and written
are all treated by the system as if they
were one step with no intermediate
activities going on the C stands for
consistency preserving in a sense of
database integrity okay that is if the
database satisfied all its integrity
constraints before your transaction it
will also satisfy them after your
transaction third the letter I stands
for isolated okay and that what that
means is that other transactions can't
see into any intermediate States in the
processing of your particular
transaction and finally d stands for
durable and that means that once your
transaction commits then it's persistent
that means it it is a permanent record
that the system is 0 is aware of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
