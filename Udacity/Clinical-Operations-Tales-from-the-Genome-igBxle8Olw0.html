director of clinical operations at a
brand new company in Silicon Valley a
promising new drug has been shown to be
very effective at reducing the risk of
prostate cancer in mice but preclinical
animal studies also showed that some
mice had a mutation in a gene that
called adverse side effects now the mice
that didn't have this particular
mutation didn't have the side effects
either now you're going to begin to
design your clinical trial to test this
in humans and you discover that this
gene is conserved from mice to humans
and it's like ninety percent identical
and about three percent of humans have
the same mutation that calls the really
adverse side effects and mice so which
of the following do you think would be
the most ethical decision to design your
clinical trial and why would you include
those humans with the adverse side
effect mean tation to have a more
scientific conclusion or since you can
identify them using their genetic
information would you not include those
individuals with the adverse side
effects of it they don't have to suffer
the consequences I want you to pick one
of these answers and tell me why in the
box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
