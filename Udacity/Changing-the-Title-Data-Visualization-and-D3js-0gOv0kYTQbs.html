and do the flexibility of both d3 CSS
selectors and JavaScript there's many
right answers to this quiz to change the
title of the course all we need to do is
figure out what type of class or ID we
can select the title with in this case
I'm going to right-click an inspect
element as you can see here it's an h1
with classes H slim left hand navin othr
one ng binding I'm going to assume that
left hand nav very unique if i call it
on a header tag as you can see here
calling d3 select on h 1 dot left-hand
nav returns to me another d3 array and
if we open it up we see the element
hovering just to be absolutely sure that
we've selected the right element now
when I just mentioned we're looking for
a header tag there's a distinction
between a header tag defined as so and
the h1 h2 all the way to h6 tags you may
see and hear people talk about both so
be sure then when someone's talking
about a header tag or an h1 h2 and so
forth you know exactly which one they're
referring to to change the inner textual
content of this h1 tag I'm again going
to find my selection store in a variable
and try to autocomplete any method
defined on my selection as you can see
here I'm going to scroll down and
hopefully find something that I may
think can help as you can see here there
is an HTML which might work there's a
property method which is also a
possibility and at the bottom here we
have text let's see what text actually
does again if we run this or execute
this statement here without parentheses
we can see the inner definition of the
function as you can see here this is
actually somewhat complicated as d three
tries to be as general and applicable to
any sort of value passed in as you can
see here on my title selection
calling text with Jonathan's pretty
pictures changes the title to Jonathan's
pretty pictures and if i open up what's
returned from the dot txt method I can
see the Dom node I called it on and
hovering hovers over the correct title
