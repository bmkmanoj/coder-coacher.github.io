can almost recover the full message
everything except for the very first
block that the point of the
initialization vector is just to hide
repetition among encryptions that would
appear just looking at the first block
and the reason for this we can look at
how the encryption mode behaves we saw
that for all the blocks except for the
first one the value of CI is the
encryption of the value M I include my
key there and we saw it for the way the
encryption mode works CI is equal to the
encryption using the key K of M IX or
ci- one the exception to that is block
c0 where the that's the value of
encrypting m 0x Ord with the IV so we
didn't explain how to do decryption but
from the way the encryption was you
should be able to figure that out we can
look at this backwards so in order to
get the last message block but what we
need to do is decrypt using TK and the
input to decrypt is this last ciphertext
block so we're going backwards we're
decrypting we don't have the message
block yet to get the message block we
need to do the XOR to get message block
n minus 1 and so that means we're
exploring that with the ciphertext value
of the previous block which we already
have right remember we have to decrypt
we start with all the ciphertext blocks
so this is how we decrypt to the last
block but each block is the same to get
message block aye we need to decrypt
ciphertext block I and XOR that with the
previous ciphertext block so we can do
that for all the blocks except for we
have this exception for the last one the
encryption for the last one
use this IV to get the last message
block well what we need to do is decrypt
the last ciphertext block or the first
ciphertext block we're going backwards
now and then XOR that result with the IV
so if we lose the IV but don't lose the
key and don't lose the ciphertext
we've lost just the first block and if
the IV was selected perfectly at random
well we have no information at all about
the first block because whatever we
get out of this decryption is ex-ored
with that IV to get the message so if we
have no information about the IV we have
no information about the first message
block but we can decrypt all the other
blocks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
