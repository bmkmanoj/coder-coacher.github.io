challenging question if you've never
done this before so let me dissect it
for you first I'm going to only look at
the very first feet of again ask how
much does why grow as v-very X and you
can see as we add 20 to X from 20 to 40
or another 22 X every time X 1 goes by
20 Y goes by 100 so the fact that that
goes in over here is y divided by X that
is a 5 I hope you got that right as you
do the same thing for the X 2 variable
you find when X 2 goes / 20 my only goes
up by 50 so we divide 50 by 20 and if I
took at 2.5 now if we left it at this
and believe this is the formula and this
number over here doesn't exist then move
you predict for this value over here is
20 times 5 plus 80 times 2.5 and that is
300 so we are 200 too large so we have
to subtract minus 200 and it turns out
the way I made this table this is
actually the correct equation so you can
check any value in the table over here
and you find that this specific linear
equation exactly explains the value over
here now that's an artifact in reality
we don't have such nice situation where
I what we call a linear hyperplane
explains data so well but it gives you a
sense that the predicted variable in
this case networth could be a factor of
more than one in per variable and that
is called multivariate regression and
all you have to know about this there's
a piece of software that just does it
for you so you can actually plug data
like this into a table and out comes the
correct result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
