solution to homework 1 which is
basically just getting Google App Engine
online first thing I do is I go to
Chrome and let's see we're gonna
download then go to Google the Google
App Engine page I'm gonna assume you've
signed up to App Engine and then we
basically go to the getting started for
I'm using Python 2 7 as some of you may
have more successful 5 I'm going to use
this hello world example and we're going
to create these two files one is called
hello world PI and the other will be
called app that llamo so let's start the
first one we'll copy this I'll go to my
editor paste this and we're gonna make
this say Udacity if I recall you're dasa
T let's go ahead and save this so I have
this I've saved this file I'm gonna make
the other file and we can just take the
contents from the getting started
document here out that llamo don't put
this in a new file and we'll go ahead
and save this okay all as well and we'll
go to my terminal and I'll go to that
directory I called it unit 1 homework is
where I save these two files you can see
there they are and then to run it
locally always say as we run dev
appserver
this is the console way of running a
Google App Engine code many of you are
probably using the GUI I prefer to use
the console version makes a little bit
easier you know if the ad projects and
that sort of stuff I'm going to run it
on a different port that's what the peak
command is for because I share this
machine with other instructors and
somebody's already using the default
8080 and then we just run it in the
current directory that's what period
does ok so this starts up it complains a
little bit about some missing api's
we're not using the image API so it
doesn't matter and then we go to our
browser and we can go to localhost go on
eight eight eight eight and there we see
it hello Udacity so all is moving we can
play around of things a little bit if I
wanted to you know change the text here
I can change it save it go to Chrome
reload more exclamation marks pretty
cool now when I want to put this online
all I do is instead of using to have app
server what I use instead is update app
CFG updates and I can run it in my
career
directory and this will upload the app
I'm not actually going to run this for
you because this would overwrite my
other homeworks that are already online
that are you know you guys can use for
demos so but basically all I do is I hit
enter here and it shatters at me for a
little while and then and then we're
done so the homework was intended to be
very simple but I realized that actually
getting App Engine running on different
platforms can be troublesome and getting
the Python versions in sync can be
troublesome I hope you guys have worked
through all those things and that's it
for homework one all I wanted to do is
get this basic website online there it
is
in my local machine and if I were to go
to where I've already got it uploaded I
think I can go to Udacity it's just 253
appspot.com right uploaded it previously
and there it is hello Udacity so always
well good job if you got that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
