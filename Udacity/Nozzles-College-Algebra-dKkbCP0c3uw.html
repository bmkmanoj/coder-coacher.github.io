word problems well is figuring out what
information isn't important for the
question that we're trying to answer we
want to know how much money grants going
to make from selling nozzles all that
this is going to depend on is the price
per nozzle and how many people want to
buy nozzles that means that these
answers with 36 which has to do with the
people who want to buy wipers are
irrelevant for this question also W is
the price per wiper set not per nozzle
so this answer which depends on w can't
be correct and this one even though it
also involves an N involves a w so it
can't be right either we're only
focusing on nozzle sales here so what
are we left with 11 11 times 2n 22 and
11 n well this looks pretty good nothing
having to do explicitly with wiper sales
however these two answers 11 and 22 to
involve an N that'll mean that no matter
how many nozzles grant cells he's going
to make either just eleven dollars or
$22 I would hope that for his sake the
more nozzles he sells the more money he
makes so I'm going to say that those
answers aren't correct so now we have 11
times 2n + 11 n the key here is
remembering that each of these 11 people
want two nozzles not just one nozzle so
each person who buys two nozzles is
going to pay him not n dollars but 2n
dollars we have 11 people paying 2n
dollars so that means we need 11 x 2 n
which is this answer right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
