two types of energy kinetic energy and
potential energy kinetic energy is due
to the speed that is the length of the
velocity vector and it grows with speed
in a quadratic fashion it contains a
factor of the velocity vector of the
spacecraft the length of that vector R
squared meaning if we increase the
velocity by a factor of two we are going
to increase the kinetic energy by a
factor of four which tells us that
speeding is really dangerous there is
another factor in here the mass of the
spacecraft and then there is an
additional factor of one-half potential
energy concerns the position of the
spacecraft as we move the spacecraft
away from Earth we have to invest energy
and that's going to become potential
energy this is the distance of the
spacecraft from the center of the earth
when we fire the Rockets to get it away
from Earth we invest energy and that
energy leads to a change in potential
energy in the case of gravity it's
easiest to have potential energy being
negative all of the time and only when
the spacecraft beaches infinity its
potential energy will be zero and the
formula for that is pretty much related
to Newton's universal law of gravity
we've got the gravitational constant
we've got the product of the masses mass
of the Earth mass of the spacecraft and
in this case / the first power of the
distance if you remember and the force
we had the second power of the distance
and of course we have to have a minus
sign in front if we double the distance
we go to half that original value but
still with a minus sign if these are the
only kinds of energy in our problem and
if energy conservation holds we know the
following the sum of these two energies
has to be a constant it must not depend
on time it has to stay at its initial
value and that's something we can use to
check our nomer
good solutions when this expression does
not stay at its original value we do
know that we're in trouble note that
energy conservation does not hold in all
models in particular if we have friction
and ignore the heat produced by that
friction energy won't be conserved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
