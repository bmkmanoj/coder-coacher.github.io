values but we can take this one step
further let's modify the original syntax
for creating a struct right now we know
that a struct has the struct keyword and
then we give the name of the struct
followed by variables or constants of
any type as many as we want and these
are known as properties so I'm going to
go ahead and make a quick change to this
here's the difference with this syntax
we can see that a strut can not only
contain variables and constants but
instances of any type that means you can
have strux that contain structs that
contain Struck's essentially Struck's on
structs on structs let's say we have
this truck representing a song and
inside the struct we have property for
the song's title its length and also
properties for the artist first and last
name so as we define a struct like this
maybe we decide that we want to include
some more information about the artist
like their age in their hometown we go
ahead and add these properties like so
but this is beginning to look exactly
like the problem we had before strux
we just have a bunch of variables and
constants and they're starting to get a
little disorganized and all this related
information could continue to grow and
get more and manageable the best way to
handle this is by pulling the artists
data out of the song struct and creating
a separate struct that represents an
artist there we go now we have an artist
struct with first name last name age and
hometown and actually we could probably
get rid of this prefix because that
would be redundant now here's the
powerful part within the song struct we
can have our own property which itself
is a struct so let's do that now so now
the song struck itself contains an
artist and this is really nice and
elegant and as we'll see later expanding
this to support multiple artists is
actually a quite intuitive process as
well so how will we access the
properties of a struct within a struct
let's go ahead and see a code example to
explain first we'll create an artist
struct how about country music artist
Garth Brooks we will use the syntax
we've seen before for the first name
we've given Garth for the last name
Brooks
age 53 and hometown is Tulsa Oklahoma
and this is according to Wikipedia when
I looked it up a couple minutes ago and
now that we have our artist struct
creating a song struct becomes pretty
simple let's create a struct for his
song thunder rolls so we'll use the song
name thunder rolls which has a length of
342 and we could represent this as a
number but we're choosing to do it as a
string for right now and the last
property that this initializer needs is
an artist and lo and behold we have this
artist instance right here called Garth
so we'll use Garth and there we go we
have an instance of a song struct now to
access the information about the artists
contained within is pretty
straightforward and it uses the dot
operator again so we'll start with
thunder rolls then dot artist and if we
go and we look to see what it contains
we can see all the properties of the
artist within and if we want to take
this one step further we can use another
dot operator to access one of the
properties within artists like last name
in this case which is Brooks so I'm sure
you can start thinking of some pretty
complex and cool relationships of
structs with instructs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
