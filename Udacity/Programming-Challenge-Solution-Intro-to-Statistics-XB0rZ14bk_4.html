probability of heads given a set of
probabilities of heads and a set of
probabilities for each coin we just need
to add up the probability of heads for
each coin multiplied by the probability
it could be that coin to do that you
just use this nifty little Python
feature that lets me walk through these
lists together called the zip it just
takes two lists and gives me the first
two items then the next two items the
next two items and so on and I call the
probability of a coin coming up heads P
coin and the probability of it being
that coin P and so we just need to
multiply those two things together and
Python has a nice little sum function so
it sums up the whole thing and we would
just return that now the slightly
trickier bit is this update piece first
to make my life easier I'll just store
the current value of the probability of
heads we need this because if you'll
call the denominator of Bayes rule is
the probability of the result now if the
result is heads we want to update our
probabilities using the same basic
method of walking to through these two
lists together we want to update this by
taking the probability for the given
coin and multiplying it by the
probability that we would have gotten
that result that is P coin which is just
that the entry from coins what's the
probability of heads for that coin and
since we got heads that is the
probability of the result given that
it's the coin and we just divide it by
the total probability of it being heads
and if it's tails we just need to do the
reverse the probability of having tails
given that it's a certain coin is just
going to be one minus the probability of
it being heads again we would have to
multiply it by the probability that it's
that coin in the first place and then we
again just divide by
the total probability of it being tails
which is just one minus the probability
of being heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
