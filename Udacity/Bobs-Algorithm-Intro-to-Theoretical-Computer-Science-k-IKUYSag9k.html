to design an algorithm that will find
these large group of genes because as
I'm sure you already have noticed in
this quiz it's rather difficult to find
these large groups you start out by
finding small groups but once you try to
extend them often you will find that one
or two connections are missing and then
you have to start over again so this is
a typical problem that you would like to
use a computer to solve for you so how
can Bob approach this problem well
actually he could write an algorithm
that is very similar to the one that
Alice has used we start out by setting
the size of the largest group to zero
because we haven't found any group yet
and then again we can try all
assignments of the value zero and one to
the genes a one meaning that we're
considering the stream to be part of
this large cluster of genes that are all
connected to each other and an
assignment of 0 and 1 to the genes is
valid if all genes that have been
assigned one are connected to each other
if that is the case then the size of
that group is again the sum of the
number of genes where we have assigned a
1 and the largest group is the maximum
of the largest group we have found so
far and the size of the new group that
we have just found so the main
difference to Alice's algorithm are two
things one is it's a bit different which
type of assignment we consider as valid
and the other one is that now we're not
looking for a group of genes or
communication standards letters as small
as possible but now we are looking for a
group of genes that is as large as
possible so since the algorithm is so
similar to Alice's I think it should be
rather easy for you to figure out our
next quiz and of course that quiz is
going to be to determine the running
time of Bob's algorithm and of course I
would like you to state that in Big O
notation again so I'm going to reveal to
you that the running time is going to be
0 of some number to the power of n times
n to the power of some other number or
the same number where and n is the
number of genes in case you were
wondering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
