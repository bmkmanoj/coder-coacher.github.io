the problem this might help us think
about what we should do how many batches
of brownies could you bake if a recipe
requires one half of a cup of sugar and
you have one cup of sugar at home this
seems a little bit easier this square is
going to represent my one cup of sugar I
know when half of a cup of sugar will
make one batch of brownies so I'm going
to fill up half of my cup and make one
batch of brownies so here's a half cup
of sugar and I know I've made one batch
of brownies if I use another half a cup
of sugar I know I'll make another batch
of brownies now I've used my one whole
cup of sugar and I don't have any sugar
left at home well I made two batches of
brownies let's pair this with some math
I had one cup of sugar and I wondered
how many times did one half go into it i
knew i was able to make two batches of
brownies so one divided by a half must
be to remember when we divide by a
number we can actually multiply by the
reciprocal we've learned that from
before so I could change this to look
like 1 times 2 over 1 well remember i
could just put any number over 1 and
then multiply fractions like before 1 x
2 is 2 and 1 times 1 is 12 / 1 is just 2
let's change this problem a little bit
and see what we can find out what if
instead our recipe called for one-third
a cup of sugar I know if I use the third
cup of sugar I'll make one batch of
brownies if I use another third a cup of
sugar I'll make another batch of
brownies and if i use my last third a
cup of sugar i'll make one more batch of
brownies so let's put this with some
math I was wondering how many times is
one-third go into one so I did 1 divided
by 1 3rd I know that for every third cup
of sugar I get one batch of brownies so
I should get three batches remember when
i divide by a number it's the same thing
as multiplying by the reciprocal I could
change this to multiplication one times
three over one eye no one is just 1 over
1 so now i can multiply these fractions
together 1 times 3 is 3 and 1 times 1 is
1 i get 3 / 13 devon is three batches I
hope you're starting to see a pattern
let's see if you can figure this one out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
