step of the central dogma transcription
and we have our mRNA so the second step
of the central dogma is to turn that
mRNA into protein using a process called
translation translation relies heavily
on the molecular machinery of a
component known as a ribosome ribosomes
are the main driver of translation
ribosomes are actually able to read an
mRNA sequence by taking it in at one end
and reading the mRNA sequence all the
way through to the other end and as it
does this it takes those 20 amino acids
and reads the code determining which
amino acid belongs in a particular
position now one of the most exciting
puzzles of the 20th century was to
figure out how this code worked I mean
how is it that this genetic code that
these four letters and what combination
is it that the ribosome can read this
and add the right amino acid was it one
base one letter per amino acid if true
that would only give us four possible
combinations an a a G a C or a u and we
know that we have at least 20 amino
acids to get to if it's 2 bases per
amino acid then that would only be 16
possible combinations things like a G a
C a u g cg a GU and so forth and so on
only 16 combinations but still 20 amino
acids so just extending that logic a
little bit further what's the minimum
number of bases needed to have enough
combinations to code for at least 20
amino acids go ahead and put the number
that you think is best in this text box
