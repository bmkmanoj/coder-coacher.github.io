agent can work in a complex environment
we see a large number of perception
action as possible and you do so
relatively efficiently suppose that is 2
to the power n percepts could be mapped
into K concepts where each of this K
concept is an equivalence class for
large number of these combinations
security power n may be very very large
but K is a much smaller number so these
concepts are not equivalence classes or
this person's so now instead of indexing
my actions on the combinations of
percepts I index my actions on the
equivalence classes that alcohol
concepts and this happens all the time
you go to a doctor for example and you
may go with some signs and symptoms and
your doctor says well I have to decide
whether i will give you a blue liquid or
a red liquid assume that those are the
actions possible and the actions and our
index not really signs and symptoms or
the combinations and signs and symptoms
which are potentially very large for
human beings but it's a small number of
concepts the number of diseases which
compared to all the combinations of
signs and symptoms is much smaller
another example of this that would come
from computer programming would be that
we might have a small number of
different ways in which a computer
program can go wrong but a large number
of different percepts that tell us what
has actually gone wrong so for example
in my purse EPS I might have whether or
not i received a null pointer error
whether or not i received a memory
allocation error whether or not i
received a index is larger than the size
of an array error all of those are
different perceptive but they might map
the same underlying concept of something
has not yet been initialized so I'm
taking the number of things that I can
actually see and mapping them to a
smaller number of ways in which the
program can actually go wrong then
instead of having to map each individual
percept to some number of actions I know
that if my error is that something has
not been initialized I need to find what
hasn't been initialized there's a much
smaller number of actions involved
looking at each individual variable and
seeing where the initialization has not
taken place now we understand why
classification is such an often studied
topic in artificial intelligence almost
every school of artificial intelligence
has studied classification extensively
if there were no concept we
mapping these two to the power n
combinations of percepts r is 2 to the
power m combinations of actions then we
could think of an intelligent agent as a
one large giant table the rows of the
table are all the two to the power and
combination of percepts there will be
that many rows and the columns are to do
the power M actions given a percept I
know exactly what action to take that
they were till through that that's going
to be very large table we don't know how
to use it it will be very costly to use
it a tree we don't know how to build
such a table what classification is
doing is it is breaking that large table
into a large number of small tables and
that's the power of knowledge when you
have knowledge you can take some complex
problem and break into a large number of
smaller simpler problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
