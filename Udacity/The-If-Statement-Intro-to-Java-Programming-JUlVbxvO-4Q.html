this lesson you will learn how your
programs can make decisions let's look
at an example here you have a typical
elevator panel and yes elevators are
controlled by computers these days and
if you look at the buttons you'll notice
that there are buttons for 10 11 12 and
then goes on with 14 so there's no
button for 13 and that's of course
because many people are superstitious
and don't want to be in the thirteenth
floor of a building now contrary to
popular belief the 13th floor is not
filled with secret government offices
there actually is a 13th floor they just
call it the 14th so the software that
controls the elevator car needs to
adjust for this human foible here's how
you can do that in Java let's say floor
is the number as provided by the user 10
11 12 14 15 16 or whatever and now we
want to compute the actual floor then we
need to make a decision in Java you use
the if statement to make decisions and
you enclose the condition in parenthesis
then you use a pair of braces and inside
you put the statement of statements that
you want to have executed when this
condition is true so if the floor is
greater than 13 then we want to adjust
by subtracting 1 on the other hand if
the condition is false then we'll carry
out the actions in the else part of the
statement in which case the actual floor
number equals the floor number without
an adjustment and that's all that's true
it let's go over the important parts
again the key word if starts out the
conditional statement the condition goes
in here and is surrounded by parentheses
if the condition is true then the part
following the F is executed and if the
condition is false then the part after
the else Clause is executed all right
now it's your turn
in some Asian countries it's not the
number 13 that brings bad luck but the
number 14 and those elevators wouldn't
have a number 14 and in fact just to
play it safe
some property owners it will eliminate
both the 13 and 214 so go
and modify the program in the next
exercise so that it translates the user
selected number to the actual floor
number and no there are no hidden floors
with secret government offices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
