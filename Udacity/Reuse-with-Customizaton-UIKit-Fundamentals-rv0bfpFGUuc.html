different text fields each embellishes
text in its own way as you type our goal
is to use delegates to create many
different customized behaviors using
just one view the first turns the words
cat dog and fish into emojis the second
sets the text color to be a combination
of color words used in the text and the
third is related to a label which keeps
a character count as you type for all
three the text field views themselves
look the same they're used directly off
the shelf as written by Apple engineers
the differences in their behavior come
entirely from delegates a delegate is an
object that executes a group of methods
on behalf of another object the ability
to reuse views without needing to
subclass and modify them is an important
goal of all graphical user interface
libraries we want view classes to be
used as is and then we want control and
model classes to have the freedom to
customize those views the delegate
pattern allows for this let's look at
some examples of view reuse and
customization in the apps we use every
day here in Safari you can see a text
field that was designed specifically for
searching it has custom completion and
is often presented with the table view
of search results if we look in settings
we see a table that uses the same view
class as the search tables but they look
and feel pretty different and present
content in a different structure how
does the delegate pattern enable the
same view classes to serve such
different functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
