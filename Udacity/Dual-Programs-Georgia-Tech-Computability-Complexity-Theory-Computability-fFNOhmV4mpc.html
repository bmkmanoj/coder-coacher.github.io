a so-called dual program which is also a
linear program this definition is most
elegant when stated in terms of the
symmetric form indeed now you see why
this form gets the name symmetric as we
saw in the exercise the dual program can
be thought of as the problem of
minimizing an upper bound on the primal
program observe that for all feasible
why we have that B transpose Y is at
least y transpose ax here we've just
used this constraint here from the
primal and the non negativity of Y from
the dual in this in turn is at most C T
X by the constraints of the dual here
and the non negativity of X in the
primal in fact we just proved the weak
duality lemma which states that if X is
feasible for the primal and Y is
feasible for the dual then C TX is at
most bt y that is to say that the value
of the primal is at most the value of
the dual and this makes sense because we
built the dual as essentially an upper
bound on the primal another thing to
note here is that if your primal problem
isn't in this exact form you can always
convert it and then look at the
corresponding dual and simplify often
however it's easier just to remember
that the dual is the problem of bounding
the primal as tightly as possible for
instance if we change the primal
inequality to an equality then we can
proceed by the same argument only this
first inequality becomes an equality and
I don't have to rely on the Y being
non-negative everything else stays the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
