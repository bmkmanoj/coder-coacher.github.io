important question in switch design
which is how much buffering do routers
and switches need it's fairly well known
that routers and switches do need packet
buffers to accommodate for statistical
multiplexing but it's less clear how
much packet buffering is really
necessary
now given that queuing delay is really
the only variable part of packet delay
on the internet you'd think that we know
the answer to this question already and
for quite some time there's been some
well understood rules of thumb but it
turns out that we've recently revisited
this question and come up with some
different answers so let's first look at
the universally applied rule of thumb
now for the sake of the examples in this
lesson I'm going to use routers and
switches interchangeably because it
doesn't really matter all that matters
here is that we have a network device
that's a store and forward packet device
that has the capability of storing a
frame or a packet and then later sending
it on so let's suppose that we have a
path between a source and a destination
and the round-trip propagation delay is
2t and the capacity the bottleneck link
is C now the commonly held view is that
this router needs a buffer of 2t times C
it should be clear why this rule of
thumb exists C is the capacity of the
bottleneck link in say bits per second
and T is a time of unit second so this
works out to bits and the meaning of
this quantity is simply the number of
bits that could be outstanding along
this path at any given time it
effectively represents the maximum
amount of outstanding data that could be
on this path between the source and
destination at any time now this rule of
thumb guideline was mandated in many
backbone and edge routers for many years
it appears in RFC's and IETF
architectural guidelines and it has
major consequences for router design
simply because this can be a lot of
router memory and memory can be
expensive the other thing of course is
that the bigger these buffers not only
the bigger the cost but also the bigger
the queuing delay that could exist at
any given router and hence the more
delay that interactive traffic may
experience and the more delay
that feedback about congestion will
experience the longer these delays are
the longer it will take for the source
to hear about congestion that might
exist in the network now to understand
why this guideline is incorrect let's
first read arrive the rule of thumb a
bit more formally and then we'll
understand why it does not always apply
in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
