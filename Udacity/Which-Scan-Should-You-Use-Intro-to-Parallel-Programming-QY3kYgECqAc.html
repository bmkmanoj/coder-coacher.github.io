more data way more work than processors
in this case your implementation speed
is limited by the number of processors
because your processors are busy all the
time
so you'd prefer the implementation that
is more work efficient
conversely let's say you have more
processors than work in this case you
have plenty of processors so you're
limited instead by the number of steps
and the algorithm and you'd be willing
to do more work to get fewer steps
you've got more than enough processors
to handle the extra work so you'd pick
the implementation that is more step
efficient there are a number of
interesting parallel algorithms that
have a pattern that looks like this you
start off with a lot of work you narrow
down to not very much work and then you
widen back out to a lot of work an
example of this is the Elex scan that we
just looked at you start reducing with a
large number of items you get down to a
small number of items and then during
down sweep you widen out to a large
number of items again in this case an
advanced but good strategy is to start
off with a work efficient algorithm when
there's lots of work once you get down
to not very much work you switch to a
step efficient algorithm when you have
more processors than work and then as
you start to widen back out you switch
back to a work efficient algorithm when
you have enough work to fill the machine
again so now as a quiz we're going to
look at three different scenarios of
things that we want to scan given a
particular hardware configuration your
task is to figure out which algorithm is
best suited the serial algorithm the
step efficient hillis and steele
algorithm or the work efficient bollock
algorithm and the scenarios are you have
a 512 element vector and a machine like
a GPU that has 512 processors you have a
1 million element input vector and 512
processors or a 128 K element vector
with one processor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
