you're having with some of these robots
do you feel that the human biases of the
people who are who are building
designing these robots are actually
impacting the kind of interaction we're
having with it on the other end yeah I
think initially we had robots that were
being built to the how would you say to
the biases and desires and imagination
of the robot builders and also to the
limitations of the form factor around
certain things so some robots came out
looking female simply because you needed
to have a wider ship base to incorporate
whatever the mechanisms being used were
and other robots came out looking
something different so we started off
with purely physical mechanical
limitations but then they became
creatures of the imagination and what's
worrisome is that that starts to
perpetuate biases and stereotypes
now just as quickly as people start to
become more informed and be looking at
good design I think we also have a
negative pressure from businesses who
can already quantify our responses to
merchandising and start to use certain
genders voices and appearances based on
what they've assessed is going to give
us the most accurate incite the trigger
give them the best burger exactly and
one of the things that someone's brought
up is you know where where are the black
robots so you already have lack of
representation but I think the lack of
representation is going to continue in
really bad ways someone has expressed
really nicely and they said that
stereotypes are not a problem because
they're false they're a problem because
they're only one of the truths
and whenever you use the stereotype you
ignore all of the other truths and so
when we use those stereotype robots
we're forcing a convergence on a very
narrow set of representations that may
be true and may be effective but are
going to do away with having any of the
other true representations it can be
very off-putting for a lot of people to
write if you're not having that target
demographic you're going to feel like I
don't relate I don't like the way that
this thing is you know portraying itself
to me it's very off-putting to write
we're going to see some very clear
things around say one of the things that
I've been tracking is the use of
gendered stereotypes in work positions
so kiosk robots are tending to being
female assistant robots female
authoritative robots male now how do
women break through the glass ceiling if
we are creating a a robotic Lea
amplified world in which women are the
assistants and service providers rather
than the executives or leaders or people
with the voice of authority this will be
sending us a few steps backwards and we
won't even see it coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
