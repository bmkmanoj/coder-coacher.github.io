remind you what we're doing so we have
this for basically we're doing window
based object detection right the
training we basically get it says
obtained training data doesn't say how
you just hopefully can go to the web or
like I said you pay somebody to click on
things because you can do that these
days you define some features so you
have to figure out what it is you're
going to measure about it and then
you're going to train a classifier and
that's what's shown here so i take my
windows that gay and i dive positives
and negatives that comes from this great
big set of training examples you see
over here on the Left I've got these
cars and over on the right you've got
these non cars so it is you use those
training examples you extract the
features and then you train your car
versus non car classifier at testing
time what you do is you again you're
going to take your new image and you're
going to take this window and you're
going to slide it all over until
hopefully you end up you land over here
and you classify it as a car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
