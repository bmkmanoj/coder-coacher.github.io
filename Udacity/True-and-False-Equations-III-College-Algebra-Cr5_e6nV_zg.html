here we have log base 10 of 100 all
taken to the third power equals 3 times
log base 10 of 100 so let's see what
each side is equal to well first we need
to figure out what log base 10 of 100 is
and it's too since 100 is 10 squared
that means on the left-hand side we have
2 cubed or eight and on the right-hand
side we have 3 times 2 or 6 8 is
definitely not equal to 6 so this
equation is not true let's move on to
our second equation log base 10 of 100
cubed is equal to 3 times log base 10 of
100 on the left-hand side we can rewrite
100 as 10 squared and that means we have
log base 10 of 10 squared taken to the
third power we know from our rules for
exponents that this is just log base 10
of 10 to the sixth we need to multiply
the 2 and the 3 and that just simplifies
to six awesome what about the right-hand
side well once again we make use of the
fact that log base 10 of 100 is just 2 3
times 2 is just 6 so this equation is
true awesome and now for this last one
over here log base 10 of 100 cubed
equals 3 times log base 10 of 100 the
only difference between this equation
and this one is the use of parentheses
here around the 100 cubed however in
this case the parentheses don't actually
change the way that we're evaluating the
expression the first thing we did over
here was find what 100 cubed was equal
to and that was 10 to the sixth that
means that this is going to be equal to
what we got here just six once again the
right hand side is the same as it's been
the other two times and we know that we
got six before so look at that this time
we have two true equations wonderful
both of these show proper uses of the
product rule and in both cases the
exponent is only applying to the input
to the log expression it doesn't go
around the entire log expression which
is why this first one was not correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
