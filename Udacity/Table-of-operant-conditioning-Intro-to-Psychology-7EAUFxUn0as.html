conditioning is that reinforcement
always increases the future likelihood
of a behavior occurring and Punishment
always decreases the likelihood of
behavior occurring let's take a look at
this two-by-two table of operant
consequences notice we have a plus and a
minus you should think of this as adding
something to the environment or taking
something away do not think of the plus
and minus as good or bad but rather just
a mathematical operation so we have our
operation are we adding something or
subtracting something on the consequence
side we're going to either add a
reinforcer or remove a reinforcer let's
think of our example with Callie
when dr. Zelig gave a piece of fish to
Callie she was using that fish as a
reinforcer and it was an impetus
stimulus something that we enjoy we can
also increase behavior by removing
something aversive for example you wake
up in your alarm clock is blaring loud
that's very aversive you turn your alarm
clock off you remove that averse in this
from your environment and you're likely
to engage in that behavior again in the
future
reinforcer is always increasing behavior
let's look at Punishers in this box we
would call this positive reinforcement
because we're adding something to the
environment in this box we call it
negative reinforcement because we're
taking something away we can also use
these operations for punishment for a
Punisher if we add something aversive
after a behavior occurs we're going to
see a decrease in the likelihood of that
behavior occurring in the future we can
also remove something positive or
appetitive and also see a decrease so
for example if you touch a light switch
with a wet hand and you get shocked
you're adding pain to your environment
and you probably won't do that again in
the future
here you're playing with your video
games and you hit your brother and your
mom takes away your video games you're
losing something that you enjoy and
you're less likely to engage in that
behavior again in the future so in this
example this would be
positive punishment because you're
adding a Punisher and in this box it
would be negative punishment because
you're taking away something that is
appetitive or something that we like and
we also see a decrease in behavior
reinforcement increase punishment
decrease</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
