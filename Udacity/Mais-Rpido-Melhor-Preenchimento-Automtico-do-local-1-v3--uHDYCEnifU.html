to do cool things like draw on the map
we've been saving the best library for
last the places library the
functionality in the Google Places
library enables your application to
search for places like establishments
geographic locations or prominent points
of interest contained within a defined
area such as the bounds of a map or
around a fixed point you'll be able to
access a crazy amount of data on your
favorite McDonald's nail salons bars
police stations that sounds like a
typical night out a Emily anyway we'll
cover details like that later
our first usage of this data is much
simpler so far we've been typing in
addresses or locations in order to
search for nearby listings in our site
what if we didn't want to have to write
out the whole thing
Google's Places library has the places
autocomplete functionality which allows
the user to get back probable results
with each keystroke while entering a
location so they can find what they're
looking for faster and more accurately
essentially we know what the user is
typing before they finish typing it
let's go back into our code and update
both of these text input areas to use
autocomplete the first thing we have to
do is include another library the places
library this will allow us to use
autocomplete and also other features of
places later so we'll define two new
places autocomplete instances within our
initialized function and bind them to
our two input boxes at the simplest
level these will predict what the user
is typing with each keystroke and supply
the most likely options in a pick list
below the input box we can also add more
options to these in addition to
specifying which text input to execute
autocomplete on we can add bounds which
is a lat/long area to bias the results
towards this won't restrict the results
but it'll favour items within those
bounds we can also add a types
restriction which will restrict the
types of places we get back to for
example addresses for only precise
addresses or establishments for only
business and we can add a component
restriction to restrict the results to
within a certain
let's try biasing the zoom to area
autocomplete to within the bounds of the
map let's test it out this makes it much
easier for the user and it also makes it
much more likely that the geo coder or
distance matrix service actually finds
the location let's look at the
difference between the zoom to area one
and the distance matrix one right now
they're both supplying options for New
York City that's because we bias the
zoom to area one two within the bounds
of the map but also because even if you
don't set any bounds the API will
attempt to detect your location and
it'll automatically bias the results to
that location thus this one is trying to
find me a place in New York because I'm
currently in New York let's change the
bounds of the map and see if it makes a
difference okay I've changed the bounds
of the maps that were looking at Detroit
now the autocomplete which I bound to
the area of the map is actually looking
for places in Detroit whereas the one
where I didn't find it to anything still
knows that I'm in New York City pretty
neat if I don't want any bias I can also
specify the bounds of the whole world
let's take a break before continuing to
find out how fast autocomplete really is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
