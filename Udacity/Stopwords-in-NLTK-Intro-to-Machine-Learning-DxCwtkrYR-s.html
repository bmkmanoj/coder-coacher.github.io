going to show you how to get a list of
stop words out of a Python package
called NLT k stands for the natural
language toolkit in this demonstration
I'm going to be using the interpreter at
the end of this video there will be a
quiz and I want you to do the quiz on
your own laptop not in the Udacity web
browser so this quiz is a little bit
different so let's get started I fire up
the interpreter to get the stop words
out I have to import them from NLT Kay I
found this line of code in an example
when I went to Google looking for how to
get stop words from NLT Kay to get a
list of stop words say something like s
W equals stop words dot words and then
as a parameter to words I have to tell
it what language I'm interested in
that's English and if you're using NL CK
for the first time like I am on this
computer you'll actually get an error
because n LT K needs to have a corpus
from which it gets the stop words a
corpus is just a body of documents so in
order to fix this I have to call this
NLT K download function if to make sure
NL TK is imported first and then what we
need is the corpora
and then we hit download this will take
a few minutes and now that that's
finished I can try again ah much better
so I can go into this SW list and I can
ask what some of the stop words are so
the first one in the list is the word I
that makes sense people like to talk
about themselves a lot let's find out
what the tenth one is yours again makes
sense what I want you to do in the quiz
now is to repeat these steps that I went
through
so use your Python interpreter to
actually download the corpus and to get
the list of stop words out and here's my
question for you how many stop words are
in the list write your answer in this
