equivalence of a random access model and
the traditional Turing machine to
translate between the symbol
representation of the Turing machine and
the numbers of RAM will use a one-to-one
correspondence e note that e of the
blank symbol is 0
that way the uninitialized parts of the
tape correspond to uninitialized parts
of ram first we argue that ram can
simulate a single tape turing machine
the role of the tape played in the
turing machine will be played by the
memory will keep track of the head
position in a fixed register say r1 and
the program and the program counter will
implement the transition function here
i've written out in pseudocode what this
might look like for the simple Turing
machine shown over here which just
replaces all the ones with zeros and
then halts being in state q0 corresponds
to having the program counter point here
so the RAM will execute a sequence of
tests for what the symbol under the head
would be and it adjusts the values of
the tape and memory accordingly
sometimes just moving to the right by
changing the value in this register and
then saying hey let's return to state q0
or sometimes the right is necessary say
for this transition here and then again
we need to move the head to the right
and then transition back to state q0 and
sometimes we need to move to a new state
like when we encounter the blank symbol
and then in queue except we hope now we
argue the other way that a traditional
turing machine can simulate a ram
actually we'll create a multi tape
machine that implements a ram since
that's a little easier to conceptualize
of course anything that can be done on a
multi tape machine can be done with a
single tape as we've already seen we
will have one tape per register and each
tape will represent the numbers stored
in a corresponding register we also have
another tape that's useful for a scratch
work in some of the instructions the
ones that involve constants like ad 55
then we have two tapes corresponding to
the random access device one is just for
input and output and the other is for
simulating the contents of the memory
device during execute
storing the contents of the random
device is the more interesting part this
is done just by concatenating the index
value pairs using some standard syntax
like parentheses and commas the program
of the RAM must be simulated by the
state transitions of the Turing machine
this can be accomplished by having a
subroutine or sub Turing machine for
each instruction in the program the most
interesting of these instructions are
the ones involving memory we simulate
those by searching the tape that stores
the contents of the RAM for one of these
pairs that has the proper index and then
reading or writing the value as
appropriate if no such pair is found
then the value in the memory device must
be 0 and we can write a new pair if it's
a right instruction after the work of
the instruction is completed the effect
of incrementing the program counter is
achieved by transitioning to this state
corresponding to the start of the next
instruction that is unless the
instruction was a jump in which case
that transition is affected once the
halt instruction is executed the
contents of the tape simulating the
random access device are copied out onto
the i/o tape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
