to you memorize a certain click paths in
order to get some kind of process done
but it's not always a good idea instead
it's better to find the general area of
where you want to get something done go
there and then figure it out
let me explain what I mean the setup
page is an important place to go it's
where you go when you want to customize
your app the schema builder lets you
visualize the objects and relationships
and add fields to them it's a good place
to go to get the big picture view of
what you're building when you click on
an object you get to the object homepage
which is a good place to look at
specific records when you click on a
record you get to the record detail page
which gives you specific of information
about that record the quick access menu
gives you handy shortcuts to customizing
your application and finally there's the
page layout editor which helps you
select the fields and display them in
the order that you want them that went
pretty quickly and you're not going to
remember everything I said Salesforce
has a lot of ways to do something and if
you click around you're gonna find it if
you don't try clicking the help link or
use the discussion forms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
