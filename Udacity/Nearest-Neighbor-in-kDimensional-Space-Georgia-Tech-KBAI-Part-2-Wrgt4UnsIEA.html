calculating nuclear in distance in two
dimensions now we can generalize it to
many dimensions so here is a
generalization of the previous formula
for computing nearest neighbor and this
new formula both the case and the
problem are defined in K dimensions and
we'll find the Euclidean distance
between them in this K dimensional space
so this table summarizes Euclidean
distance between the cases and the new
problem in this multi-dimensional space
where we are dealing both with the
origin and the destination and where the
origin as well as the destination is
specified by the x and y coordinates
looking at this table we can very
quickly see that D and not B or E is the
closest case the most similar case the
new problem Q this method is called the
KNN method where NN stands here for
nearest neighbor K nearest neighbor
method this is a powerful method as
simple as it is of course it also has
limitations one limitation is that in
the real world the number of dimensions
in which I might want to compute the
distance between the new problem and all
cases might be very large a high
dimensional space in such a situation
deciding which of these stories is
closest to the new problem may not be as
simple as it appears here a second
difficulty with this method is that even
if the new problem is a very close to an
existing case that does not mean that
the existing cases solution can or
should be directly applied to the new
problem so we need both alternative
methods of retrieving cases from memory
and methods for adapting past cases to
fit the requirements of the new problem
that is called case based reasoning and
we'll discuss that in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
