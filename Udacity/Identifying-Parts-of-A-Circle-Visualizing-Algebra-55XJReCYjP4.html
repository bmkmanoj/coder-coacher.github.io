circle the number on the n is our
squared and so the square root of this
number is the radius and then if there's
a number next to the X and a number next
to the K these are the numbers that form
our Center we take their opposite sign
from the one that's in parentheses so
for example if this is negative and this
is negative then both H&amp;amp;K will be
positive whereas if there were positive
signs inside of our equations then that
means that these two values would be
negative let's check out a few examples
to see this in action here's a circle
centered at the origin with a radius of
5 notice that this equation is really
the same as this one if we subtracted or
added 0 to the x and y value we'd still
be at a center of 0 comma 0 this is our
H and this is our k i'm going to switch
between these graphs right now I only
have this one being shown as graft when
I turn this one off and turn this one on
I notice that I get the same exact graph
as before and that should make sense
because if we subtract zero from
anything it doesn't change the value
here's another circle and this one has a
center at 3 comma 3 we took our old
circle and shifted it 3 units to the
right and three units up vertically we
can even see that if we examine two of
the points on the circle this one at 05
for this circle has now been moved to 3
comma 8 for this circle we moved three
units right for the X from 0 to 3 and 3
units vertically from five to eight and
it turns out that this is true for all
the points on this circle we can examine
another point and see that it was moved
three units right and then three units
up and here's a different circle this
one's been shifted four units to the
left and then one unit up vertically and
notice too that the center of this new
circle is at negative 4 comma 1 this is
the H value and its opposite and signed
in the equation and this is the K value
which is opposite of this number in the
equation here's one final graph for this
one it's been
22 units left and two units down and if
we examine its center it's at negative 2
negative 2 notice that these two signs
are opposite than the ones in the
equation here's our H value and its
opposite which is negative 2 and here's
our K value which is opposite so
negative 2 now that you've seen the
general equation for any circle I want
you to try and figure out what are the
center's and radius for each of these
circles work carefully and don't forget
to pay attention to the minus and
addition signs good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
