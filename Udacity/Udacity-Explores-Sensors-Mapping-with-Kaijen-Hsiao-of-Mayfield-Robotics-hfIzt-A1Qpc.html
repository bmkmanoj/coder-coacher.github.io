them has to do with how he navigates and
that's the home so he has a depth sensor
in his ire transparent window belly and
he has also an IMU an inertial
measurement unit in there and he has
encoders of course in his drive wheels
and in his head degrees of freedom and
all those are used to allow him to build
a map of her home and navigate within
the home localize figure out where he is
cetera he also has capacitive touch
sensors in his head so if you pet him he
knows it he has four microphones around
his neck which allow him to you can hear
through his microphones but also he can
do speech recognition and also audio
localization so if you talk from a
certain direction because he has a whole
entire ring of microphones he knows
which direction of is he can turn
towards you he has a camera in his left
eye and that enables him to see the
world so he can recognize people and
pets and also allows you to look out
through his camera and see the world and
he can take pictures for you
but we also use that to aid in
navigation he has clip sensors in the
back rear clip sensors so that if you're
driving him around telling him then you
don't drive backwards off a cliff
and finally he has a bump sensor in
front so if he hits something he didn't
see which because the sensors are
optical there are inevitably going to be
things that he doesn't see then he can
bump into them though they hate
something physically and back up and
make his adorable animation of oh what
did I just hit so four fronts cliff
something he uses his front depth sensor
which is an entire depth sensing array
which allows him to see both low
obstacles and what others stairs in
front of him that he shouldn't go off
and also higher obstacles that are above
the level of his main laser so that he
doesn't quote finds himself on tables
and things Craig collects data for
mapping your home so when you first get
create then there's an onboarding
procedure where you're encouraged to
drive create around your home and teach
them about the various places just like
if you had a guest that you just brought
home and you would say oh this is where
the bathroom is and this is where your
room is for curry you would say things
like this is my living room and this is
my kitchen and this is a cat tree where
the cats hang out and that's an
important place that you should know
about because I want pictures from it
and so as you drive pray around teaching
him about all these places he makes a
map of your house and that map is stored
both on the robot and in the cloud
so that if for whatever gets reset etc
then he can just download it again and
know about it
he will also take data in the form of
pictures and video of your pets and your
family your loved ones and those are all
controlled by you we will never look at
those pictures unless you give us
explicit permission because you want to
healthy bug or something those are all
controlled by you you can you can
control exactly who gets to see those
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
