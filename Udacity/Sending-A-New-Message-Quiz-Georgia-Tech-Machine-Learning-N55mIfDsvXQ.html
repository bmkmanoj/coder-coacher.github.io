a message which is made up of four words
a b c and d and let's assume that all
the four letters are used equally in the
language they occur the frequency of
each letter occurring in the language is
equal so you can represent a b c and d
in binary with two bits each each like
so which means if we have a sequence
such as 0 1 0 0 1 1 the 6 bits spell out
the word be a bad so basically we
require 2 bits per symbol another way to
look at this sequence is that you need
to ask two questions to the sequence to
at least recognize one symbol so two
bits per symbol also means that you have
to ask to yes or no questions per symbol
now let's consider the second message to
be made up of the same symbols but in
this case it occurs more frequently than
B C or D D occurs more frequently than B
and C and let's assume that these are
the probabilities by which we can see a
B C or D now we can do the same thing
again we can use the same binary
representation to represent a b c and d
so again we'll end up with two bits per
symbol but can we do any better well it
occurs more frequently than others so
can we somehow use this to our benefit
and use a different bit representation
to get slightly less than two bits per
symbol think about it can you think of a
new representation that might be better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
