for our average deviation and that can't
be a good measure of how spread out
these are I would think that if we had
the same data point over and over again
that the spread if this would be zero
but here we have a lot of data points
all over the number line and there's got
to be some kind of spread there so this
can't be our measure of spread if we're
going to get zero the problem is that
the negatives are cancelling out the
positives when measuring spread we don't
care if our data values are above or
below the mean we just care how far they
are from the mean so how can we make
sure that the positive and negative
deviations don't cancel each other out
cheers all that you think could work
ignore the negative sign at least for
those with negative deviations multiply
each deviation by to square each
deviation in other words multiply each
deviation by itself or is there nothing
we can do but first this is very tricky
please think hard about this because
measuring spread is crucial to
statistics good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
