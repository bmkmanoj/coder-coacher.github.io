random regular graph it's random because
each graph is uniformly selected at
random from the set of all regular
graphs a regular graph is simply one
where each node has the same degree and
a graph and jellyfish is one where the
switches in the topology are the nodes
in contrast to the earlier data center
topology diagram we saw here is a
picture of a jellyfish random graph with
432 servers and 180 switches every node
in this graph has a fixed degree of 12
jellyfishes approach is to construct a
random graph at the top of racks which
layer every top of racks which I has
some total number of ki ports of which
it uses RI to connect to other top of
rack switches the remaining ki minus RI
ports are used to connect servers with n
racks the network then supports n times
ki minus RI servers and the network is a
random regular graph denoted as follows
formally random regular graphs are
sampled uniformly from the space of all
our regular graphs achieving such a
property is a complex graph theory
problem but there's a simple procedure
that produces a sufficiently uniform
random graph that empirically have the
desired properties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
