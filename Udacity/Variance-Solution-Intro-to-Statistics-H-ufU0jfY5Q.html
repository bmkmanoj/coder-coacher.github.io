the mean using the mean function assign
it to a new variable that I make up
called mu so this is now inside the
variance and I know the mean and here's
how I construct my new lists my end data
list i first set it to the empty list
then i go through every index in the
original data structure so Len data as
we know gives from the number of
elements range construct a list of
indices from 0 to 1 minus that then
Agatha sequentially that allows me to
index the i'th item in my data structure
now I take the item i subtract the mean
and this is a very short notation for
squaring it I could have just done the
same times itself but this is my new I
element that i append into my in data
set so by doing this with a for loop I
get a parallel data set called end data
that is data minus the mean squared now
i compute the mean of that new end data
and return it that's my veins it turns
out there is an even more elegant
version to do this in Python and it
requires a good amount of programming
skills that are probably way beyond most
beginners programming skills but he s
all goes you can do this in two lines
you can compute the mean as we've done
before with our functional means that we
programmed ourselves and here's the
tricky part we're now going to compute
the mean of a new list and we couldn't
construct this new list in a single line
that's the key thing here the wavy
constructors is we go through all data
items for X in the data and we construct
a new list out of it where the math from
constructing the new list is X minus mu
to the square so this loops for all the
data items and applies this equation to
each data item construct Sulis passes
this list on to the mean function and
returns the correct values so this is
one of the most compact ways of
programming the variance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
