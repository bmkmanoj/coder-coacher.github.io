and DRAM SRAM stands for static
random-access memory DRAM stands for
dynamic random-access memory the random
access part in both names simply refers
to the fact that we can access any
memory location by address without
needing to go through all the memory
locations so random access is as opposed
to sequential access like a tape where
you have to actually scan through the
whole tape to get somewhere with memory
we can arbitrarily access any part of
the memory without really needing to get
to it so the only difference between
SRAM and DRAM is this static or dynamic
behavior static in SRAM refers to the
fact that SRAM retains its data while
the power is supplied so as long as you
connect it to a power source it's going
to retain the data that you wrote to it
it's not going to lose it dynamic in
DRAM means that it will lose data even
while connected to a power source unless
we refresh the data
so pretty much we need to read out the
data and write it back in and keep doing
that on a regular basis otherwise DRAM
will simply lose our data note that both
of these types of memory will lose data
when the power is not supplied such as
when we turn them off so it seems like
SRAM is better we like it because we
don't have to do anything in order for
it to keep the data whereas with DRAM we
actually have to access the data and
write it back in in order for it to not
lose it so why do we want to have data
the answer is that for s Ram
several transistors are needed for each
bit of SRAM
whereas for DRAM we only need one
transistor per bit so obviously we can
get a lot more DRAM per unit area then
we can ask so s ROM is good because it
retains data but that because it's more
expensive here we have to refresh the
data to keep it alive but we can cram a
lot of these bits on a chip it turns out
there is another difference which is
SRAM is typically faster
and theorem is typically slower so we
get speed and simplicity at more cost or
we can go slower and need to work at it
but have more bits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
