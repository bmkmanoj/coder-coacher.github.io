our shopping list app to use all of
these techniques we've just learned with
templates so first thing we're gonna do
is going to get rid of this code that
we've been playing around with get rid
of this N equals n we don't need that
anymore
then we're gonna go to our shopping list
and get rid of this stuff we don't need
this anymore okay let's go back to our
browser and make sure of things okay
when we reload this you see our basic
shopping list type in food and it
appears in the URL we could type in a
different food milk and it updates that
parameter in your URL now let's go ahead
and add in the functionality that we had
before with the hidden input elements
and actually showing the list of foods
that we had added so far okay now first
thing we do is from get rid of all this
well most of this stuff let's uncomment
it for now okay so we don't need any of
this HTML junk anymore this stuff was
nasty so let's get rid of all of that
and we don't need any of this stuff and
this line can just go there okay so
we're just gonna get our food get all
get parameters food out of the URL store
them in items and then we're gonna pass
items into our template now the variable
names don't always have to match when
you're passing things into the template
but I find very often they do generally
makes your life a little easier because
then when you're thinking about you know
you're often working in a template and
in your handler it's handy to just call
things the same thing so you know you
don't have to do that translation in
your head now we had all this HTML up
here we're not going to use this anymore
so let's just go ahead and get rid of it
let's go ahead and update our shopping
list template okay so the first thing we
want to do is add in the hidden input
elements so if items for item in items
let's add our hidden input input type
equals hidden name equals food value
equals item notice we can substitute our
variable right in the middle of this
HTML here because in the template the
HTML is not special it's just it's just
a string and we can substitute anywhere
into the string that we want let's close
up our loop okay let's make sure this
part works first recall if this parts
works we should see things appear
in the URL it's always good to test as
you go in case you make a mistake you
know you know have that mistake for too
long okay milk and now if I add eggs
I see eggs and milk in the URL let's add
some more food you can see things are
starting to accumulate in the URL which
means if we look at the source that our
template is actually working and we're
adding all these hidden inputs most of
whitespace is all messed up that's not a
big deal it's basically cuz our template
includes whitespace and it's getting put
in here literally but hTML doesn't care
about extra whitespace all as well here
so far back to our template let's add
that shopping list to the bottom so
again only if we have items if items
we're gonna say we're gonna add a couple
blank lines it's not the best way to add
blank lines but it works for us okay we
do our shopping list and it's gonna be
and let's say unordered list now for
each item in items list that item close
our unordered list and our if statement
and let's indent everything and let's
let's fix our indenting okay and let's
see if this works close the source we
build this page and there behold is our
shopping list let's add some more items
cheese it appears on our list and
appears on our URL and if we view the
source of this page we can see our
hidden inputs here and we can see our
shopping list down here and if I were to
modify this URL we can see that
everything disappears likewise if we
delete it here everything goes away okay
very cool now looking at our code this
is much simpler we have our parent class
that just has our simple rendering
functions and then our main page handler
has actually gotten a lot shorter all it
does is it gets the items out of the URL
and passes that into the shopping list
template which now has the structure of
the HTML that we're actually generating
and this is a lot easier to think about
than that madness we had before with
string substitution and string
concatenation and all of that that was
very difficult to read and everything
here works you know much more smoothly
now there is one little problem that I'd
like to show you let's add some food
here now I can just autocomplete our
food because our shopping list is
learning our tastes what happens if I
really want some pizza and I put our
pizza in an h1 okay
nothing the HTML is not interpreted and
the food is just added directly to our
list or the raw HTML in this case the h1
is displayed or is HTML actually
rendered in which case our food appears
very big in our list in this particular
case once you go ahead and try yourself
and see what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
