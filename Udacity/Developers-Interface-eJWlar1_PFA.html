systems we need to know how application
developers interact with it there are
two main ways of doing this one way
keeps track of a position or cursor in
the file and as we read or write to the
file we move the cursor around the other
way allows us to treat a file as though
just a block of memory let's cover the
position based strategy first we begin
by opening the file with the open
procedure specifying how we intend to
use it with some flags notice that I'm
using the lower level system calls
rather than sees built-in procedures
like f open which sometimes use an extra
layer of buffering it's not that the
extra layer is a bad idea I just want to
interact more directly with the
operating system having open the file we
can then call read or write as we wish
right i should say over rights instead
of inserting as the cursor does by
default and most editors and as we read
and write we move the cursor through the
file if we want to move the cursor
without reading or writing we use the l
cecum in which repositions the cursor in
the file and finally when we're done
with the file we should close it so that
the file system knows we're done now
I've skipped over most of the details
here because I thought it would be a lot
more fun for you to learn them on your
own with a little programming exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
