the task at hand and you thought maybe
you had some ideas Soto tell me how can
we define you and PI in terms of Q okay
well so I guess the first thing to
observe is that you as a value right now
you are value okay yes you as a value
that's correct you turns a number a
scalar in particular where pi returns in
action yeah well you have s returns a
scalar that's right in a PI of s returns
in action very good right okay and you
know we have the definition for you up
there near the top and it's just the
reward and then sort of behaving
optimally thereafter where Q is a reward
and then taking a specific action and
act and behaving optimally thereafter so
we can sort of turn Q into you if we
always pick the best action and we know
what the best action is it's the one
that you know maximizes the value that
you're going to get from that point on
so I would say that U of S could be
defined as max over a of Q s coming
simplicity itself
mmm-hmm nicely done I have no idea how
we're gonna grade that automatically cuz
it's hard to type A's under other A's
but yeah that's exactly right that we
have the maximization over all possible
actions of the q value in that state
like that's just great mm-hmm how about
the policy so the policy would look
exactly the same the the the policy that
you want to follow anyway is the one
that maximizes your value going forward
except the difference is it's returning
an A and not an actual about you so it
should be Arg max oh so it's not exactly
the same right it's almost exactly the
same our max right so this is it's just
so trivial so it's so cute gives us
everything we need if only we had a good
way of finding Q yeah if only if only we
could find the q IQ for you and that's
going to be the essence of Q learning oh
well done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
