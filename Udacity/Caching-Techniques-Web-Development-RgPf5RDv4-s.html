approaches we've talked about and kind
of the different properties they have so
the first approach was no caching and
and this meant on every page view we
were doing a DB read and when we
submitted a new piece of art there was
no DB reads then we did this kind of
what I would describe as the naive
caching approach which was basically
have the basic cache if the cache is
empty
through the DB read and if it's not
return the result and what we'll add a
third column on the edge here called
bugs so the naive caching only does a DB
read on a cache miss and doesn't do any
reading on a submit and it's full of
bugs or at least has one bug where the
the front page would become out of out
of date that the front page becomes
stale so then we started clearing the
cache this has the same property of
doing a DB read on a page view no DB
read on a submit and no bugs then we
improve to the kind of the refreshing of
the cache and so this means we're no
longer doing any DB reads on page views
or very rarely basically only the first
time our app turns on and the cache is
empty and that first page you every
other page view after that is cached
which is a really nice property to have
and we're doing one DB read per
submission and it works now the
difference between between these two and
this one is the notion that a page view
doesn't hit the database hardly ever and
that's a really nice property to have
you should always be striving to have
the situation where a normal unlogged in
basic you know viewer of your website
doesn't touch the database and I'm going
to kind of condense that down to the
notion that simple users shouldn't touch
the database basically you know they're
just lurkers they're just reading so
they're not changing the site so they
shouldn't be touching the database
everything should be cached and ready to
go for them that makes the user
experience better because the requests
will be faster and it makes keeps your
load down because you can add many many
of those users and because they're just
bouncing off the cache you don't have to
do very much work to serve them you
don't have to actually hit the database
now there's a fourth approach that we
didn't implement yet which is the most
aggressive of all of these and I'm going
to kind of refer to this as distinct
from refresh
I'm going to call it updating the cache
and I'll and I'll talk about this
approach in just a sec and we can get to
the state we're on a page view on a
simple page view we do 0 DB reads ever
and this is slightly better than rarely
and we don't do any database reads on
submission either and it works this is a
really nice property I have now of
course we still do our database right
you notice we haven't been optimizing
rights at all because you've got to
store this you got to store the
submission at some point but you can cut
down on the database reads lower them to
both 0 by keeping your cache completely
up to date and I'll show you how we
might do that right now ok we're going
to look at this picture one more time
here we know all the pieces now the user
ASCII Chan the database in our cache
we're going to talk about a new
situation here so let's like let's
pretend our cache is already warm you
know it's got some pictures in there and
reading the front page which hits our
cache which you know returns the result
that we sent back to the user nothing
too complex there we're not hitting the
database because we're only doing reads
now what happens is when we do a
database right we're going to send that
right to the database
we're simultaneously going to send that
right to our cache as well and so this
this gets a little bit more complex
we're going to send the right to the
database and instead of immediately
rereading from the database to update
our cache or clearing our cache we're
just going to update the cache we're
going to say ok this affects the front
page so let's find that front page cache
insert our new piece of you know ASCII
art into the cache and then from then on
that follow-up request that redirect
that follow-up requests to slash is
basically going to bounce right off the
cache again and so we never did we never
did a database read during this whole
process we're just writing only the only
time we would do a database read is when
we that you know start off the app for
the first time and do that first request
or maybe we have a program that that
does that for us so no user ever does a
database read and this is actually how
we do things on reddit now every listing
you can look at is stored in its own
cache and when you submit a link or do a
vote we update all of the appropriate
caches all all the different cache keys
that may be affected so so we've kind of
introduced the trade-off here of you
know complex inserts versus database
reads unread
we actually do this we have you know
different cash key for every every
listing you might look at you know for
every sorting for every subreddit all
big cetera et cetera and when you submit
a link or you vote we have to update all
of all the possible listings that could
be affected by that action on the flip
side you know users are pummeling the
site all the time and they never read
from the database and you know so we
have complex inserts plus speed which is
nice but you know complexity is
complexity on ASCII Chan we probably
don't need to do this right now our site
just isn't at that scale that doesn't
you know a cache Stampede isn't a
realistic threat because we don't have
that many users but if we did this is
the kind of approach we'd want to take
and and so this is kind of the name of
the game when caching you know if you
want to keep this cache totally accurate
without doing database writes we're
going to have to do you know complex
code so one thing to keep in mind is the
more accurate the cache the more complex
the code and these are the decisions
you'll make as you build your website
and as you're scaling you know this is
probably the ultimate solution you want
to look to when you're kind of caching a
database you know if the solution works
