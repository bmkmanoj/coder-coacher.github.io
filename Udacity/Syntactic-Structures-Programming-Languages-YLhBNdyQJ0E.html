linguist and in his seminal 1955 work
syntactic structures he suggests that
utterances have rules syntactic rules
and they're governed by formal grammars
the problem with the wrote wrote wrote
dee dee dee bag of words above is that
they don't form a grammatical sentence
we much prefer grammatical sentences
it's easier to interpret them and figure
out what they mean we can write down
these formal grammars using a special
notation here these five lines together
are my formal grammar and each one is
what is known as a rewrite rule the
words that I've written in blue are
called non-terminals if you have one of
these things written in blue you can
rewrite it with whatever's to the right
of the arrow these words that I've
written in black never occur on the left
of any one of our rewrite rules so they
can never be replaced once you get there
you're stuck and the process terminates
we call them terminals so using these
rules if I start with sentence I can
rewrite sentence to be subject verb and
then I could rewrite that by picking any
one of the rules that has subject on the
left
let's pick students I've only replaced
subject leaving this verb non-terminal
alone but then I could replace verb with
any one of these rules and at this point
I think we're done the process
terminates because I can't replace
students or think with anything so here
I've used one two three rewrite rules to
start from sentence and end up with a
valid utterance this sort of maneuver
with all these arrows is sometimes
called a derivation because I was able
to derive students think starting from
sentence using these rewrote rules even
using this relatively simple grammar
however I have a few options here I've
shown another derivation starting with
sentence sentence goes to subject verb
verb goes to right subject goes to
teachers and I've produced another
string in
language of the grammar both students
think and also teachers write can be
produced by that grammar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
