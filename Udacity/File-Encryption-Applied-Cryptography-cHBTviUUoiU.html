symmetric ciphers and we know how to
generate a random key we're going to
talk about an application which is to
store a file securely and our goal here
is that we have this is the computer it
may look more like a stapler but it is
intended to be a computer and we have on
that computer we have some file what
we'd like to do is store that data on
the computer know that if we leave the
computer in a coffee shop and someone
captures the computer they won't be able
to read the contents in that file this
is to prevent the kind of incident one
hears about fairly frequently in the
news where someone has a list of Social
Security numbers for everyone at the DMV
at the driver's licensing office and
they leave that on their laptop and it
gets stolen and then you've got a big
worry about all that personal
information being lost probably that
kind of file shouldn't be stored on
someone's laptop in the first place but
our goal is to be able to store files
that contain sensitive information and
know that even if the computer that
they're stored on is stolen the contents
of the file will still be secure now we
don't want to just throw the file away
we want the owner of the file to still
be able to read the file and so we're
going to assume that there's some key
that the owner of the file can store in
some other place that's secure we'll
talk a little bit later how we might
want to do that but let's assume there's
a key that can be used to decrypt the
file so here's the straightforward way
to do this we're going to take our file
we'll call it m and we'll divide it into
blocks and the block size will depend on
the cipher we're using let's assume
we're using a cipher with a hundred
twenty eight bit block size which is the
size that AES uses then what we'll store
is the cipher text and each ciphertext
block is the result of encrypting using
the key K the corresponding message
block so how well does this work let's
try a quiz so the question is assuming
that ye has perfect secrecy we know this
is not true because we're reusing the
key to encrypt multiple messages and
Claude Shannon showed that this would
only be possible in the case where the
number of possible keys
must exceed or be equal to the number of
possible messages and that's not the
case here
but let's assume that for now what can
an attacker learn if they capture the
laptop and acquire C check all the
choices that are true
the choices are noting the length of M
the value of K which blocks in M are
equal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
