Mike wills and I'll be your instructor
for this course every time you visit a
web application your browser is
requesting a number of files that are
sitting on a server somewhere out there
on the Internet
more often than not that server is
running Linux therefore as you develop
and get ready to launch your own web
applications it's critical that you
understand how these servers work and
how to get your web application up and
running on one in this course you'll do
just that you'll start with a quick
introduction to Linux and you'll begin
exploring the Linux file system how our
file is organized where do they belong
I'll then introduce you to a number of
Linux security concepts managing users
how to understand the permission system
firewalls and package or software
management finally you'll get a very
basic web application up and running
using the Apache web server and a post
course SQL database server managing and
configuring servers is one of my
favorite parts of this career there's
something very powerful and knowing
you've taken a server from zero to hero
all on your own and are in full control
of its capabilities I think you'll enjoy
this experience and in the end you'll be
able to truly share your web
applications with others while having
the most intimate low-level knowledge of
how people are actually receiving and
experiencing your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
