I've made my shock absorber and I've
designed it on my 3d program and now
what do I do a hit a button and send
this to a printer or how's that really
work and so most 3d prints work off STL
files or obj files and almost any 3d
software program can export to stl or
obj so once you do that then you can
decide what kind of 3d printing is going
to work best for you or maybe it's just
what's accessible to you something like
this was built on an SLA machine which
means it printed similar to a hot glue
gun would print right where it's it's a
hot piece of material coming through a
hothead and printing up layer by layer
and building that up and where's this
one's great we're sound in the world but
yeah yeah and what's really great about
it is there's a billion ways to show
people on screen your design and your
idea but most people don't really
understand that until they can hold it
in their hands and feel it so that's
really the advent of 3d printing is what
I can take this to my boss and say look
this is going to save us so much because
of this design look at how much material
we've saved or you know this is going to
work so much better this way and that's
that's kind of glory of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
