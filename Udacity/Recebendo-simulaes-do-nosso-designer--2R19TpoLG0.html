meaningful apps come from grade
intention now the best way to surface is
intention is to build a user interface
that's easy to use and as clear value
for the quick report app why not allow
users to get a sense of earthquake
activity around the world in order to do
that we've identified certain pieces of
metadata that'll be most helpful in
understanding that activity we even came
up with a few muck late ideas for how to
display that data and to kick them up to
another level we roped in one of our UX
designers to develop a more refined
design let's take a look at the final
mock-up ok so here's the design mock of
the main list view simple and clean
right pretty cool now if we zero in here
on the list item design you'll notice on
the left that we have a colored circle
that contains the magnitude earthquake
they'll also notice the fluctuation and
color that we have here in these
different circles to reflect the change
in magnitude strength now this is the
most important piece of information
about a quake so the circle in the color
provide a good way to drop prominence to
this piece of important data now in the
center we have the general location name
with the details highlighted above it
using a slightly bolder font all caps
and lighter text now all these subtle
choices combine to help focus the user
on what's important and then lastly on
the right side we have the date and the
time formatted nicely also using a
similar stacked layout as location name
in the details some of you may be
thinking what do i do if i don't have
access to a designer now while it's
certainly advantageous to have a formal
design perspective it's also very
possible to channel some solid design on
your own it may just mean you'll have to
spend some more time iterating on a
design idea and ground your ideas around
some guidelines such as the material
design guidelines here see the
instructor notes for some additional
tips on building a great UI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
