we're going to square this leg of the
triangle add it to the square of this
leg of the triangle which is equal to d
squared alright potenuse this is really
just the Pythagorean theorem we have a
number squared plus another number
squared equals the hypotenuse squared
and what we could do is take the square
root of both sides of the equation this
would leave us with d equal to the
square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus
y2 minus y1 squared great thinking if
you got either of the equations now the
order of these variables doesn't
actually matter since we're squaring the
numbers if we wind up with a negative
value here it would become positive
since we're squaring it the same is true
for the Y values if this value is
negative and we squared it it wind up
being positive so perhaps an easier way
to think about it is just think about
the change in the X and the change in
the Y how far did we travel this way and
how far did we travel this way we'll
square both of those take their sum and
then take the square root to find the
distance this symbol right here that you
see is Delta and it's a Greek letter
that means change you may have seen this
in chemistry or in other courses and
this Delta just means change I think
it's easy to think about the change in
the X values and the change in the Y
values to find our answer this is more
simple than writing this crazy notation
memorizing the formula is not so
important as really understanding that
we're setting up a right triangle in
space when we find the distance between
two points that can always help you
