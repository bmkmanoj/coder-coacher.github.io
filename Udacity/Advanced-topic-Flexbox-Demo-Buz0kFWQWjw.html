first course I'm just well dive deep
into a little more about using flexbox
display and dishing out this is a new
way of creating very very responsible
grits and layout and it's actually
really easy so this is a dental dam will
feature is the basis of so listen that I
starting my webpage from scratch i do
not want to use this crap i do not want
to use a cutter
ah great layout structure i want to be
able to figure out how to braid my own
custom layout using plus X long and
here's the code and sleep and go throw
down here here's basically the career
here is always a the objects as you can
see here and I've use just the basic CSS
actually color because this could
clearly see what are we going to
actually align create a layout a nice
layout so basically in this case i'll
start off as I just great ideas and by
default their display call display block
they take up the whole width of the
browser and a stack on top of each other
and that's by default how everything
works now
so how I would changes from the default
is by two from lock this plane to flex
displayed it's really just one line of
code here in my container also need to
make sure that we have here is actually
crucial to do so a lot of developers use
a 1 by 1 do to continue everything else
so it allows them to control law of the
rest of the elements back here so my
continued object here element i will go
and actually confidence and say this and
now i refresh and flex so this is what
like that and you're like wait a middle
what just happened less by default
choice to put everything in instead of
like a horizontal mode it it lines up
everything in a more vertical so
basically what we've done is in my code
we were able to lay out all our disks
side-by-side set up the stack stack on
top of each other now sometimes you're
like well that's behind us up kind of
like the structure but i won't be able
to control the layout little more is
there a way to control layout and it is
called flex crap this is often in CSS
called electro absolutes the racking
feature and here we go
so basically it goes back to what we've
seen before like with less wrap actually
if the element doesn't fit on one row
actually wraps around the whole webpage
well then you can figure out what just
doesn't mean i want to be able to like
control I i want whether an
advertisement to live side-by-side so
how do we do that and he is learn blacks
and display flexes this late that's why
gives you the basic foundation in order
for you to be able to control the width
of your element so let's say okay I
won't be able two of you know green this
isn't that this is my weather app let my
habit Iseman the whole uh go
don't be side-by-side will take each
take-up of fifty percent of mine with of
my browser same thing I want my gray and
white yellow or related article am I not
really really are able to do all the
two-chair cyclists are also we will be
simply do is just be just you know this
is possible to hear just set the width
and height locked right here does
fashion in a couple of steps i'm able to
create some of the layout alright and
yes can see this is pretty fast you say
that well more like this is great but I
don't yell to have a very flexible
layout in say a person were to load this
up on them in a mole mobile device
so basically if i were to go if I want
to resize as you see I'm sizes are no
this is basically the size of all
typical mobile phone but but you won't
you don't want them to look at this tiny
whether section here at any advertising
section you actually want them to think
about ok let me just say no way for me
to go ahead and like layout everything
start on top in my bowl
what lies in my view for this way and
then i have the weather advertisements
related article on the elderly are the
great great yellow and the way of red
it's like my slide when a user is using
a better script is called me gay boys
and learn that and we shall CSS and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set I'm gonna
have all logic says like if the width is
around is greater then 360 pixels if
this is is we're going to mcc pixels i'm
going to have a degree in the red the
great yellow show my side and it with is
less than 30 or 60 pixels like this way
this way I'm gonna have all these divs
back on top of each other
what I do is I go back here 20 code and
I include the media or not you've
learned that in CSS class again reminder
it's called media at me just clean and
middle with is 361 so basically if the
middle with Teresa want i want to create
so basically if I have a big screen the
user has screen
I want the green red green yellow
% otherwise I'm gonna have all of them
stacked on top of each other because by
default you go with is one percent for
each division so let's refresh that so
if you look at this is what will
simulate how you would simply on mobile
phone 36 e and as you think about okay
this is what you will about mobile phone
and if i increase the screen we now
going to someone with a bigger screen
fix so that's basically a quick demo
like how you would like to start
thinking about using these flexbox
properties to learn about to play some
pretty robust I also very old and
elegant way so I really highly recommend

using your own layout tools because i
know we we've talked about you strapped
