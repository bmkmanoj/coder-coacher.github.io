shared belief that learning has the
power to uplift to empower and transform
lives today we have students in our reps
that come from 29 countries you come
from countries like the United States
Belarus Saudi Arabia Somalia Brazil
China Thailand Japan Macedonia we also
have our amazing partners here with Dede
IBM Amazon Google and many many others
today March 8 marks International
Women's Day and it seems fitting that
our conference should be on this day the
world is getting increasingly divided
and often in that with the women that
get left behind education is the most
important way to empower people to give
them the opportunities they need to lead
the lives they want while we may not
have deliberately picked this day per se
for the conference we did pick the venue
deliberately because the Computer
History Museum embodies everything that
Silicon Valley is all about for us it's
a very special place the museum sits
less than half a mile from the Google
campus LinkedIn Microsoft and Intuit if
you go six miles north you land at
Stanford University if you drive eight
miles south you are at the Apple
spaceship campus Udacity we sit about a
mile and a half from here it's pretty
hard to get any closer to the epicenter
of Silicon Valley the Computer History
Museum was the brainchild of a person
called Gordon Bell who founded Digital
Equipment Corporation it started out in
Boston and then moved to Silicon Valley
about a decade ago but because every
Silicon Valley company has that
proverbial garage story to it the
Computer History Museum happens to be in
a trailer at Moffett Field from
many years before it came into its
permanent existence the museum has
always recognized people for their
incredible contributions to the world
and you will see a wall of them outside
of this hall in fact the first fellow
the museum recognized for ideas that
change the world and affected humans
with the indomitable woman Grace Hopper
you'll see her photo right outside today
as you go through the museum you will
see Silicon Valley come to life right
outside the entrance is the Fairchild
Semiconductor exhibit with their
founders as you go through you will see
people who broke ground and defied
gravity create companies like yulik
packard Xerox PARC IBM Apple Atari
Google and many others and then you will
wander in to be an exhibit which has a
self-driving car that our founder
Sebastian run have something to do it
today you are the Mavericks and the
Trailblazers just like these people were
you are forging a trail of new learning
and the opportunities it brings to
affect people's lives and someday one of
you could be the next hopper the next
page the next jobs the next bell and you
might be an exhibit in some museum
somewhere in the world
we as Udacity hope to arm you with the
learning you need to get there just so
that one day when you're in one of those
museums we can say we knew them when
they were taking a nano degree
with that let me run through some
details of the day we have a packed day
with panels in the morning breakout
sessions and then a panel later on in
the afternoon and then we have an
awesome party we also have 23 companies
that are waiting to talk to you about
job opportunities so make sure you visit
them during the afternoon there are some
details
cell phones should be turned off during
the sessions the wireless access is
intersect the password being Udacity
please be social throughout the day
these are our handles share talks share
pictures share comments on everything
along with the Udacity app with that it
now gives me great pleasure to introduce
the CEO of Udacity Vishal maka Jonny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
