so you can see here my final
configuration for this chair ended up
with a 160 grand cherokee nose based on
having four metal legs I didn't give it
arms I give it a metal back and of
course the 100 grand metal seat that was
required as far as how I actually did
this though like before I started off by
writing out the initial constraints we
were given the chair has to cost less
than sixteen dollars that 100 grand
metal seat and it has a hundred grand
metal seat and that seat has the cost
ten dollars so 100 grams times ten cents
per gram means ten dollars for the seat
after this however we're already pretty
close to our price limit so the plan i'm
using might specify that when we're
getting within a certain range of our
price limit to operate under a heuristic
that calls for minimizing the cost that
heuristic in that plan might then say
find the part that can be minimized the
most next that part would be the arms
the arms had a range of 0 grams 250
grams meaning that arms are not even
required in our chair so to minimize our
costs we're going to go ahead and cut
the arms and say that our arms cost
nothing now our plan might recognize
that we're no longer quite as
constrained by our price so we're going
to choose the next most important part
of the chair which might be the legs
given some information that the plan has
about the ideal legs it might choose to
have four legs that are 10 grams each
are made of metal which gives us a cost
of four dollars based on the ten dollar
seat in the four dollar legs we now know
we have two dollars left for our back
the plan may have a heuristic that says
it's ideal to match materials or the
plan we have a heuristic that says the
metal is the optimal material to use so
it may choose metal and given two
dollars for the remaining money in a
material of metal it can derive that 20
grams is the mass available for the back
then now that all these individual
variables have been assigned we can then
see the D final mass is 160 grams as a
cost of sixteen dollars at most sixteen
dollars meets that constraint and we
have our hundred gram metal seat over
here that's good David it's important
note that they would use several
different kinds of knowledge first he
had knowledge of the generic chair he
knew about the components he knew about
the slots but not necessarily all the
fillers for the slots second he had
heuristic knowledge he used it term
heuristic recall it Tom Hiddleston's per
rule of thumb
so at heroes tech knowledge about how to
go about filling the values of some of
these slots third explicit in this is
not just a knowledge about legs and
seats and arms and so on but also how to
spear as a whole is decomposed into its
components that is one of the
fundamental roles of knowledge and
knowledge based AI it allows us to
structure the problem so the problem can
be addressed efficiently notice process
the configuration design is closely
related the method of constraint
propagation that we discuss in a
previous lesson here are some
constraints and his constraints will be
propagated downwards in the plan
