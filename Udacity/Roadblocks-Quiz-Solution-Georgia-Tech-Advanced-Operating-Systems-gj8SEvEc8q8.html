boxes here and let's talk through this
now clearly if we want to do anything in
the router we need mine from the router
vendors so this is a big challenge and
convincing the router makers that yes
please open up the network so that I can
dump some code in it and execute the
code so that is a big challenge the
second is also a big challenge and that
is if you look at the traffic on the
Internet today is just humongous there's
so much traffic on the internet and this
is the reason why routers are dumb
animals all that they do is when a
packet comes in
it's all happening in hardware they do a
table lookup to figure out given the
destination what is the next hop that I
send this packet to so the internet core
the routing fabric is operating at huge
speeds because even at the edge of the
network today we are already seeing
gigabit speeds which means that the core
of the network you have several hundreds
of gigabytes of packet processing that
needs to be done and therefore it is
important that the core of the network
be blazingly fast and software routing
is not going to be able to match the
speed that is needed in the core of the
network for packet processing so these
two choices are good choices
now does active networks make the
internet more vulnerable not really
because the Internet is already
vulnerable
perhaps it adds to it but not
particularly making it more vulnerable
than what it is already and the last
choice regarding code spoofing so long
as we make sure that the fingerprint
that we generate to associate with the
code that is going to be used for
processing the capsule when it arrives
in a node is cryptographically strong
then we can make sure that this code
spoofing does not happen so I would say
these are the two choices that apply for
this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
