concepts that have to do with the way a
software architecture evolves the first
one is architectural drift which is the
introduction of architectural design
decisions that are orthogonal to a
systems prescriptive architecture that
is they are not included in and
compassed by or implied by the
prescriptive architecture and the result
of architectural drift is that you start
from a clean architecture like the one
that I'm showing here and then you start
adding pieces without following a clear
plain like for example here we add an
additional room here but we don't really
do it in the right way so we need to add
something else to keep it stable and
then maybe we want some more room so we
add a tent and then another side of the
house it doesn't really follow the same
architecture but it doesn't matter we
just put it there because we want to
expand and maybe then we want to put
something drastic there even though it
doesn't really fit the overall design
and the overall architecture so I think
you get my point the fact that the
architecture then becomes unnecessarily
complex hard to understand and
ultimately awkward just like the one
that I'm showing here that goes from the
original building to this final
monstrosity the second concept is
architectural erosion which is the
introduction of architectural design
decisions that violate a system
prescriptive architecture so in this
case that we were introducing decisions
that were orthogonal here we're
introducing decisions that don't comply
with the prescriptive architecture and
the result of architectural erosion is
typically a poor architecture an
architecture that is going to have
problems in the future
so both architectural drift and
architectural erosion take you away in
different ways from what you think your
software architecture is or should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
