calling an end transaction at that point
all the changes that are being made to
persistent data structures have to be
written to the log segments that records
the redo logs for this application so at
this point lr vm creates a redo log in
memory of the changes that have been
made to the persistent data structures
that is this region that has been
modified it's going to be written as a
redo logs he doesn't know within that
region lr vm does not know within this
region specified by base address and the
length where exactly these data
structures are contained all it knows is
that this is the portion of the address
space that is being modified in the
critical section that's why it's so
important as a developer to make sure
that the data structures that you're
manipulating are within this region that
you have signal to lr vm lr vm is
basically thinking that there is a
contiguous set of addresses starting
here for a certain length that may have
been modified in this critical section
so the log record that it writes is
basically saying here is the start
address and here is the number of bytes
and this is the new data that goes into
this virtual address space that's what
lr vm is creating as a redo log in
memory remember that redo log is itself
a data structure of lr vm in memory we
should not confuse the redo log with the
external data segments external data
segments are the persistent versions of
the in-memory data structures now the
redo log is the changes that have been
made to the in-memory versions of the
persistent data structures that have not
yet been committed to the disk in terms
of the external data segments it's now
available at this point at the end of n
transaction it's available as a redo log
entry in the log segment which was
initialized by this application now the
semantics of this transaction is if it
commits then all these changes are now
available on persistent storage so what
the ELL RVM library has to do is not
only create the
do log record which is a data structure
in memory so far as L rvm is concerned
but it also has to flush this video logs
to the disk at the point of commit and
only after that we can assume that all
the changes that have been made in this
critical section has been persisted on
the disk so it has to flush to the disk
synchronously meaning that this end
transaction waits for this redo log to
be flushed to the disk at this point it
is on the disk however again in order to
make sure that we can have a performant
implementation of lr vm there is a more
available in the end transaction and the
moon says no flush meaning at the point
of entrance action you don't necessarily
have to block the caller for the flush
to be complete transactional semantics
would require that the process that is
executing this commit should not be
allowed to go past this point until the
synchronous i/o has completed from the
redo log into the disk but in order to
make it a more performance conscious
design if you think that power failures
are rare and the chances that your
server is going to crash is not very
high then you can go ahead and say as a
developer that at the point of entrance
action I want you to commit it by the
way you don't have to block me in other
words this mode if it says no flush it
is saying that yes I want you to commit
it to the disk but don't block me from
going further so the changes that have
been made as a redo log record would be
committed to the disk later depending on
the specification of no flush so as a
developer if I say no flush then the
redo log is not going to be
synchronously written to the disk so I
can go ahead I might do another
transaction that might write more log
records so I can reduce the number of
i/o operations in committing these log
records to the disk so that's an
opportunity that I'm exploiting by
giving this no flush mode in the end
transaction so it's an opportunity for
the application to both reduce the
number of i/o operations and also make
sure that the application is not blocked
here waiting for the synchronous right
to the disk to complete so once the
transaction is committed meaning that lr
vm has created the redo log for this
particular transaction then the undo
record is no longer needed because undo
record if you recall was created just
for the eventualities that this
transaction may not commit but now that
the transaction is committed we can
throw away the Sun to record on the
other hand instead of the end
transaction the transaction may actually
abort if it aborts then what lr vm has
to do is restore this portion of the
virtual address space of this process
from the undo record so that we have
gone back to the state before this
transaction ever happened so in other
words we're making whatever code that
the server executed as a critical
section code between begin transaction
and abort transaction to go away and we
restore the computation to its state
before this begin transaction by copying
the undo record into the portion of the
virtual address space that have been
modified through this critical section
code so that in a nutshell is how you
would use the primitives provided by lr
vm in constructing a server that has
certain persistence requirement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
