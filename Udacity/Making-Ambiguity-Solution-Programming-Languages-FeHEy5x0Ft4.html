represents some made-up language kind of
a cross between my nonno Python and
JavaScript it has a lot of keywords that
are found in a lot of languages so let's
say we add a new rule in the question we
need to answer is whether adding this
new rule to this grammar creates an
ambiguous grammar as a reminder an
ambiguous grammar is one that given a
string in that language there are two
parse trees there are two ways to
traverse the grammar and create that
strength as we'll see later this is
really bad for languages that we want to
interpret because it can result in the
situation where one string one program
one HTML document has two valid meanings
and so you can't really choose one and
that's not what we look like we use
these precise languages such as HTML and
JavaScript so that we know exactly what
we want to be displayed are the exact
actions that we want to be performed we
don't want to ambiguity computers don't
handle ambiguity very well their little
brains explode so we can sit and stare
and think about this for a while but
I'll just give you an example string
that actually shows that adding this
rule makes the grammar ambiguous guess
it's a check so let's go over that so
here i have the string and what we need
to do is show that there's two ways
using this grammar to generate the
string so one way is using the
if-then-else construct where this if
this then and this else ouch here here
and here I mean this part of the string
corresponds to the sea this one goes
here and this one is from the e right
there that's one way to do it a second
way is using the if then do these two
symbols and then the if then else here
meaning that this corresponds that s
this corresponds to that e and then we
have an if-then-else as that s so here's
two valid ways using this grammar to
generate the same strength this shows
that the grammar is ambiguous when we
add this role
let's do another let's say we add this
role B goes to a B and then Abby this is
also ambiguous say we have print for to
my goal in / in 24 so now we have two
ways to create this one way is to start
with a be from there we go to SB from
here we can do print for we can replace
the B now I forgot to add that replace
the S with the print for an alternative
way is basically do something very
similar or we start with the B let me go
to BB but this time we replace each be
with the S semicolon so that's our
second way here there are two more rules
and either these rules makes the grammar
and big us when we add the keyword int
this is the only way to get intense so
there's not going to be a second way to
generate strings with the end and the
same basic logic applies to the
parentheses as well this is the only way
I have parentheses and there's not going
to be a second way there all it does is
add parentheses on the outside of a
statement and we can do it as many times
we want but given X number of
parentheses you just supply this next
number of times not a whole lot of fancy
stuff going here the fact that they
match also is kind of a key contributor
to this if you had a parenthesis on one
side and had another roll with the other
side then you could probably hmm then
you could maybe get some ambiguity
depending on your word but that's how
this is let's go on to the last one so
this should look familiar and I believe
we went over this in lecture or
something very similar to this and this
is definitely ambiguous now come up with
one example say we have 1 + 2 + 3 we can
do this in two ways we have e goes to e
plus e goes to 1 and this eventually
goes to 2 + 3 an alternative way that we
have the two on the left hand side and
we have the three although the meaning
of a plus the associativity of addition
allows us do it in any order from the
spective of a language of strings
perspective / determining whether or not
the context-free grammar is ambiguous
the meaning of a plus is irrelevant here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
