understand the threats and
vulnerabilities of DNS let's take a look
at the DNS architecture so we have a
stump resolver which issues a query to a
caching resolver at this point we could
have a man-in-the-middle attack or an
attacker which observes a query and
forges a response if a query goes
further than the local caching resolver
say for example to an authoritative name
server an attacker could try to send a
reply back to that caching resolver
before the real reply comes back to try
to poison or corrupt the cache with
bogus DNS records for a particular name
this attack is particularly virulent and
we will look at a cache poisoning attack
in this lecture masters and slaves can
both be spoofed zone files could be
corrupted updates to the dynamic update
system could also be spoofed we will
look at some defenses to cache poisoning
including the oh x 20 defense as well as
DNS SEC which can protect against some
of these spoofing and man-in-the-middle
attacks in addition to these attacks
we'll look at an attack called DNS
reflection where the DNS can be used to
mount a large distributed
denial-of-service attack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
