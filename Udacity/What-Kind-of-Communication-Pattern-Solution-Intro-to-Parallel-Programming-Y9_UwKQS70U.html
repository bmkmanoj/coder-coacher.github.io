there's a one-to-one correspondence
between the output and the input so
that's clearly a map operation now this
next one is also a one-to-one operation
one value gets written in the output
array corresponding to every value that
gets read from the input array and you
can see that we're writing into a an
array which is represented in a major
order here and the output and in J major
order and the input so this is a
transpose operation now this next code
as I said I put a guard around write
only the odd-numbered threads are going
to execute this so that rules out a map
it's not one-to-one and that also rules
out a transpose operation which is also
one-to-one and you couldn't really call
it a stencil operation either because a
stencil operation should generate a
result for every element in the output
array and this doesn't do that now if
you look at the first one the thread is
taking the input at a given location I'm
multiplying it by PI and placing that
into a couple of different places in the
output array in fact it's incrementing a
couple of different places in the output
array so this would be a scatter
operation the thread is computing for
itself where it needs to write its
result and its final line would be a
gather you can see that every thread is
writing a single location in the output
array and it's reading from multiple
places in the input array locations that
it computes so this would be a gather
and again this looks very much like a
stencil operation since it's reading
from a local neighborhood and doing some
averaging and writing the result but I
wouldn't call it a stencil because it's
not writing into every location because
of this guard here so that's why I refer
to this as a gather rather than a
stencil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
