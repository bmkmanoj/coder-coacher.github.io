completed chorus function definition
that contains code to print out the
chorus to heart of glass but how can we
actually use this to actually use a
function inside a program and prompt
this whole block of code to run we have
to call it and a function call just
means we refer to that function by its
name in this case chorus with empty
parentheses and we follow that by a
semicolon and this looks sort of like a
call to the print line function only
print line was attached to our system
dot out screen output and most of the
functions we define in this lesson will
stand on their own so calling this
function prompts the set of code
contained in our chorus function
definition to run and this call will
print out the four lines of the course
that we expect it's important to note
that calling and defining a function are
done separately our function definition
for chorus has all this information like
the return type and name and all the
specific code that the function contains
but to actually run this code we have to
call the function separate from this
definition this is sort of like the
difference between definitions of words
in a dictionary and actually using those
words in a sentence when we need to
learn about a word and what it means we
can look it up in a dictionary we can
learn details like how the word is used
in a sentence and how it's pronounced
but then when we actually use the word
in a sentence we don't include its whole
definition we just refer to that word in
a separate text and so the dictionary is
like a function definition which gives
us the details of what our function does
and how it can be used it shows us the
code that our function contains and
tells us if it's accessible or if it
returns any data but to actually use and
execute a functions code in a separate
program we have to call it we don't
include the whole definition we just
refer to it by name so definitions
describe a function show us its internal
code and let us know how to use it and
calling it function is referring to that
function by name and we only have to
define a function once but you can call
that function as many times as you like
so now we have a function that prints
out our chorus and we can call it and
get this output and we can call it
repeatedly let's call it twice in a row
now our course will print out twice and
it's easy to repeat and
if you want to change something about
our Korres code like changing the
spelling or punctuation we can change it
inside our function definition and when
we run this code multiple times the
output will change as well but we'll
only have to change our one line of code
inside our function definition now let's
get some practice defining and calling
functions of our own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
