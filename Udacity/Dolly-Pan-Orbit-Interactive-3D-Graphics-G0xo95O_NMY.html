camera moves here's a top-down drawing
of a viewer in an object when you adjust
the field of view that zoom when you
move directly towards or away from an
object you're looking at that's darling
it's not zooming I have a zoom on my
camera does not mean if I want to make
something larger I run towards it in I
yell zoom it's so easy in computer
graphics to either zoom in or dolly in
that they're sometimes not that easy to
tell apart however they're certainly
different in their effect on the cameras
field of view and location the one
giveaway that you're dollying and not
zooming is that if new faces become
visible or disappear zooming changes the
size of the image seen but does not
change visibility all that said I'll
sometimes say zoom in when the controls
are actually dolly controls just because
most people don't know what dolly n
means the camera controls for most of
the programs in this course have the
mouse wheel and middle mouse button set
to dolly the view in and out the other
common camera moves are panning and
orbiting penning means moving left or
right as you keep the camera pointed
forward for most programs we're using
the right mouse button pans orbiting
means circling around the target
position similar to know how it is
satellite orbits the earth for those of
you into first-person shooters it's
circle strafing a target the target
location is often placed at the center
of whatever object is to be examined in
most of our programs left Mouse orbits
around a target location incidentally
all these mouse moves are just what we
happen to use there are no ironclad
standards among programs about which
mouse button does what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
