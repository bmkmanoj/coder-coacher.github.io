perspective developers write code
they're responsible for implementing
feature requests fixing bugs and so on
their incentives tend to be more feature
oriented they want to have big launches
as accomplishments building new features
might be dependent on exploring new
technologies or approaches that have not
been used before taking new risks
operations people run services they
might take care of physical servers or
run services on hosted infrastructure
they do deployment upkeep and
troubleshooting their incentives tend to
be more stability oriented anything that
requires new untested technologies or
introduces new features is a potential
problem for the stability and
performance of the system the work Ops
does is also usually invisible to the
company Ops is noticed when something
does not work not when everything works
fine the new release the developers get
praised for might cause problems in
production and its ops that gets page if
the app is unavailable to the user while
both of these perspectives are valid
sometimes they seem like opposite and
conflicting interests they of can feel
like ops is blocking their work by not
providing resources fast enough or not
being supportive of new cutting-edge
tech and ops can feel like devs are
being irresponsible and reckless and
just implement new features without
thinking of a performance and security
and there are other players in the field
as well like product management product
managers maybe even more feature
oriented than devs they may make
external promises and they might not
ever talk with traditional operation
staff if the organization has a security
team they may be even more change averse
than ops in the fear of introducing new
unknown vulnerabilities or on the other
hand they may be more willing to risk
service downtime in order to patch newly
discovered vulnerabilities quickly and
then there's business management
responsible for budgeting and buying
resources ops may have to requisition
additional resources from them and
reason why they need those resources
even if the underlying problem might be
performance of the new release so how
can you get all of these involved
parties to understand each other's
different perspectives and work towards
shared goals after all a service that's
offline doesn't have any features and
that's bad for everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
