metrics that come up in practice so
we've looked at statement coverage which
is a close relative to line coverage
we've looked at branch coverage also
called decision coverage and for most of
you out there these are the coverage
metrics that are going to matter for
everyday life now as I said before there
are many other coverage metrics and
we're going to just look at a few of
them and the reason these are
interesting is not because we're going
to go out and obsessively get 100%
coverage on our code on all of these
metrics but rather because they form
part of the answer to the question how
should we come up with good test inputs
in order to effectively find bugs in our
software so the loop coverage is very
easy it simply specifies that we execute
each loop zero times wants and more than
once the insight here is that loop
boundary conditions on extremely
frequent source of bugs and real codes
and so for example if we had this loop
in our Python code so for line in open
file that is to say we want to read
every line from the file and then
process it to get full loop coverage we
would need to test this code using a
file that contains no lines using a file
that contains just one line and using a
file that contains multiple lines now
let's look at a fairly heavyweight
coverage metric called modified
condition decision coverage or mc/dc and
if that seems like kind of a big
mouthful there's a reason for that which
is that mc/dc coverage is required for
certain kinds of avionics software that
is if you're going to write safety
critical software where if the software
fails airplanes can fall out of the sky
then one of the things you'll need to do
to show that your software is correct is
get a high degree of mc/dc coverage so
it's designed to be pretty rigorous but
still without blowing up into an
exponential number of tests mc/dc
coverage basically starts off with
branch coverage so I'm going to simplify
here a little bit but mc/dc coverage
basically starts off with branch
coverage and additionally states that
every condition involved in a decision
takes on every possible outcome
conditions are simply boolean value
variables found in tests and decisions
are just the kind of tests that we see
in an if statement or a while loop or
something like that and finally every
condition used in a decision
independently affects its outcome and so
that's kind of a mouthful this is going
to be hard to grasp unless we go through
an example so let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
