which takes a string s this would be the
HTML input and if there's HTML input s
would cause Mozilla to crash test
children fail otherwise it should return
pass we're simply going to search
whether s contains a select tag for this
we set up a simple regular expression
which says if there is some substring in
s which consists of an opening tag
select and then an arbitrary number of
characters which are not a closing tag
that is not a greater sign this is
expressed by this carrot over here
meaning not the greater sign not the
greater sign and then star meaning zero
or more instances of that and finally a
closing tag so we can have a less than
sign select then anything except for
greater than sign and finally a greater
than sign this is what makes an HTML tag
and if this occurs anywhere within our
string we return fail otherwise will you
turn pass this regular expression
requires a function from the re module
but we first need to import this so
let's see what happens if we feed in
just a regular HTML tag into the testing
function what we get is pass because
there's no Select tag in here let's
expand this a bit and now let's actually
add a select tag in here as in this
example now we see that our output
changes to fail because in here we
actually do have a select tag so this is
what our testing function does it simply
simulates the behavior of Mozilla
normally we would pass this input to
Mozilla and then see whether it crashes
or not but in order to keep things
simple we're simply having this simple
testing function which checks directly
for what is supposed to be the input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
