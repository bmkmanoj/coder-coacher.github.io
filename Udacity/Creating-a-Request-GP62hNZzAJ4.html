Swift to begin you'll want to download
the starter project for the image
request app a download links posted in
the instructor notes I've downloaded the
project already so let's run it and see
what we have the interface is extremely
simple there's just a single label in
the center and it says that an image
will load over this label if we stop the
app and go to the main storyboard we can
see there's actually an image view too
but it currently doesn't have an image
it'll be our job to get an image from
the internet and display it within this
image view now let's open the
viewcontroller.swift file we're going to
be doing all our networking code right
within its viewdidload method the first
class I want to introduce you to is
nsurl as you might have guessed this
class lets us represent a URL I'll
create an instance of it called image
URL and initialize it using a URL string
that I copied beforehand this is a URL
for a cat image that I like feel free to
use your own URL but make sure that it's
HTTP we haven't talked about HTTPS yet
but we'll see why it's important later
in this lesson now that we have a URL
the next step is making a request the
class that we'll use for this is called
NS URL session in this URL session is a
class that can manage Network requests
on our behalf we can create our own
nsurl sessions with custom settings or
we can use the shared nsurl session
which comes preloaded with default
settings the shared nsurl session is
what is known as a singleton if you've
never heard of a singleton before it's a
special kind of object that can only be
instantiated once so if I use the shared
in its URL session and this will file
and then in another file I use the
shared nsurl session I'm actually still
referring to the same object in both
files because it's a singleton and there
can only ever be one the use of
Singleton's is common when it makes
sense to only have one instance of an
object
now this distinction may not be
incredibly important to you now but I
wanted you to know what the term meant
in case you see it again anyways we
don't need to make custom nsurl sessions
so we'll just use the shared nsurl
session for now if you are interested in
creating your own custom inish Yoel
sessions then you can look at the nsurl
session configuration class it allows
you to change things like the amount of
time
you're willing to wait for a network
request before canceling it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
