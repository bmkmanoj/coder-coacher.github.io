design some espouse a particular point
of view as to how best to structure a
system such as object-oriented design
some of them are intended for a
particular class of application that is
the design of real-time systems and some
of them are structured to deal with only
a part of an application such as user
interface design all approaches to
design however include three aspects
that may be compared the design method
the design representation and how that
design is going to be validated us first
look at design method a method is a
systematic series of steps by which you
undertake to do your design and solve
your problem typically a design method
suggests a particular way of viewing the
problem with object-oriented design we
view the problem in terms of a set of
cooperating objects only later do we
assign the services or functions that
each of those objects are going to be
able to provide to the system
other methods that we may be mentioning
during the course of the term include
structure design and role based design
the design method that is chosen acts as
a discipline for the participants the
designers and ultimately the
implementers forcing them how to
organize their thoughts and an
activities in certain ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
