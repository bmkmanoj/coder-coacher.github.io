divided by root rather than to expand
the factors of a variable but not all
powers are evenly divisible by a route
we know three doesn't divide evenly into
14 we could rewrite X to the 14th as X
to the 12th times x squared we use our
product rule to split this up into two
separate cube roots and since we know
the cube root of x to the 12th equals x
to the fourth this would be our final
answer an easier way to get to this more
quickly is to use power divided by root
and to look at the remainder we know
this radical can be written as X to the
14 / 3 so when i divide the power by the
root i get 14 / 3 which equals 4
remainder to notice that the four
appears as the exponent of our factor
outside of the radical whereas the
remainder 2 is the power inside of the
radical so using this idea of the
remainder I want you to see if you can
simplify this radical use the idea of
power divided by root to figure out what
would be on the outside of the radical
and what would stay on the inside when
you think you have it put your answer
