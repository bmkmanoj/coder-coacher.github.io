statistics like those in an unsorted
list well plan a especially for
mathematically minded people might be to
sort the list first which as we say
reduces the problem to one previously
solved so that is safe we know how to
sort we can sort the list and then apply
the ideas that we had just been talking
about now we're going to be talking more
about sorting in a little while but for
now the important thing to know is that
the running time of sorting is big theta
of n log in for a list of length n this
is under the comparison model yada yada
yada but the important thing to make
note of here is that it's it's worse
than just running through the list right
you have to run through the list
repeatedly login times essentially and
that may be overkill in some cases if
you're interested in a very quick and
possibly entertaining introduction to
sorting I've got a music video on the
topic called the sorter which you can
find on youtube will try to send a link
so plan B is to try to extract this
statistic that we're looking for in
effectively one scan through the data so
big theta of N and the time that it
takes to zip through the list looking at
the values we should be able to get
certainly the men and the max turns out
we can actually get the median as well
which is a really interesting result so
let's stop start off with a very
straightforward one the mean of the list
or the average of a list this is how a
statistician might write it mu or the
mean is the sum over all the elements of
the list from 0 to n minus 1 we look up
the value we sum them all together and
then we divide by the number of values
it's just the definition of an average
and it's really straightforward to do
that in Python as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
