sorts but that doesn't mean that every
adjective is going to necessarily
contribute to this list of attributes so
it's fine to have one and then discard
it as not being relevant okay
you had single leaf you have leaf
counter we have this one sit modify sub
trees there's another call it a trick
another way of getting modifiers that
aren't directly they don't correctly
come from adjectives and that's if
you've got a prepositional phrase such
as parts of the tree or count of the
leaves you could think of tree parts
okay and leaf counts and so on so once
again the the the simple rule of saying
adjectives doesn't quite get you
although all the way where you want to
go so some of the issues that arise when
you when you try this technique okay as
we said parts of the tree doesn't appear
in in the natural language to be an
adjective however we still want to
recognize that the word part signifies
an attribute of tree same for count of
leaves and as you indicated the use of
the word long even though it's nominally
a an adjective doesn't really contribute
here in the sense of being a modifier
for one of these classes the phrase
single leaf if we think about it for a
minute has to do with the count of the
leaves this is a one of a potential
different number of counts that a leaves
could have that is there's a count
attribute and that has a value of one
okay single being seen single meaning
one similarly the phrase two subtrees
can be interpreted as a count of the
number of sub trees in the tree class
having a value of two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
