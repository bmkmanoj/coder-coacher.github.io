want to break it up into words and
punctuation and word like elements and
we use the special term token to mean
all of those in general a token can
refer to a word as string numbers
punctuation it's the smallest unit of
the output of lexical analysis remember
that's what we're currently working on
mostly tokens do not refer to white
space which is just a formal way of
referring to the spaces between words so
we're going to be focusing on lexical
analysis thing a process whereby we
break down a string like a sentence or
an utterance or a webpage into a list of
tokens one string might contain many
tokens in the same way that one sentence
might contain many words here I've
written six HTML tokens given them names
on the left and examples on the right
now the naming of tokens is a bit
arbitrary in general though tokens are
given uppercase names to help us tell
them apart from other words or variables
so here this left angle corresponds to
an angle bracket facing left presumably
quite sure how to draw that the smaller
end is to face left angle / is a left
angle bracket followed by a slash
division sign the right angle bracket
and angle bracket facing to the right
here's the angle here's the face the
equal sign is just an equal sign a
string is going to have double quotes
around it and a word is anything else
welcome to my web page punctuation like
that now it turns out that the naming of
tokens is not quite an arbitrary matter
you may think I'm as mad as a hatter now
that's a different story so we're just
going to go with these token names for
now but if you're designing a system
from the ground up you can rename them
to be anything you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
