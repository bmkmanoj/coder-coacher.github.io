quick examples when the query was an
average of an exam grade that was
authorized but the result was disclosing
you know somebody's grade which we we
didn't want that to happen so obviously
we want to have defenses against these
kind of inference attacks these defenses
actually are actually pretty hard in
general if you can submit an arbitrary
number of such queries you can always
make an inference based on the results
those queries return but there are some
things that we can do to reduce the
likelihood of somebody finding sensitive
information by using such queries with
this limited amount of effort what kind
of Defense's can we have in place so
remember the way we do these aggregate
worries that are allowed is that the
query sort of says select a set of
tuples so for example that case we had
where we looking for junior standing
we're going to pull out all the tuples
with the standing attribute value a
junior so we're going to pull out all
the tuples that match this query in some
sense and then we're going to aggregate
the exam score so one way to make sure
that inference is more difficult is that
we don't do that when the number of
tuples that are selected is too few the
idea here is when it's too few extreme
case when it's one then we know that the
average actually discloses the score
that we have but if it's a small number
of tuples the average is going to be
close to the score of every person who
is selected or whose tuples are selected
so average for a small set essentially
tells us what those values are and we
don't want to do this average query when
the number is too small well you can
think of other cases where if you asking
for some property and that selected set
of tuples is very large then that sort
of holds for everyone and if it holds
for everyone then it holds for a given
user as well so both too small and too
Lars actually lead to this inference
problem i'll let you think about the two
large part but so you should see the
aggregation is happening over a set of
trouble
and it does it include every tuple or
almost every tuple in the database or
does it include very few and depending
on the nature of the query that we have
you may say that you know we can't run
that query because of the number of
these tuples that it's going to
aggregate over so that's one way to do
that the other defense that we typically
do is saying well we can transform the
data the database and can remove all the
identifying information think about the
exam score that I was talking about
let's have we drop the student ID and
standing even if you concerned about too
few students with a certain standing and
then we just posting the exam score
without the names or the IDs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
