learning what's going to help me it's
the data the data are the first thing
that's going to help me there's somebody
else is going to help me I'm going to
bring them along in a minute so here we
have some images of pictures and as you
can see in the red circles there are
some pixels that are from say skinned
and there are pixels that are not from
skin and let's suppose I just want to
label a pixel or a little patches is
that skin or is there not skin by the
way this is a cute little thing for
those of you out there we did a bunch of
skin detection cetera and in sandy
Pentland slab and I think that starter
was involved back when he was a student
it turns out the color of skin is pretty
constant the luminance changes right so
some people you may have noticed our
darker than other people but they're
darker they just have more of the same
pigment pigment right the melanin
pigment so when you look at skin in a
color space if you remove the illuminant
it's actually possible to detect skin
for a very wide range of how dark the
skin is using the same color removing
the alumina now you have to worry about
lighting and a bunch of other things but
it makes sense great because there's
only one pigment anyway we're going back
we're looking at skin color there's a
bunch of pixels that are skin color and
a bunch of pixels or not so what am I
going to do well what I do is I'm going
to take the skin pixels all the pixels
that I somebody supervised members
supervised learning have classified as
being skinned pixels and I'm going to
build a little histogram of their
feature now the feature that we're using
here is hue hue is the essentially the
color with the amount of brightness and
saturation removed it's you know how red
greenish blueish yellowish is is the
color and what this is is this is a
little box that's essentially the
percentage to histogram that's the
percentage of pixels of the skin pixels
that have this hue and a histogram is an
approximation to the probability
distribution but notice that it's the
probability of getting that particular
Hugh given that it's skin it is not the
probability that
its skin given these hues ok this is the
remember the likelihood all right well
what do i do after I've done the skin
pixels well I do the not skin pixels I
build another graph right and in fact
what's interesting is you'll notice
there's a little bit of overlap here
right that's not too surprising there
are some effect in real life they're
actually would have been some down here
to it said or whatever because you know
there are skin colored pixels in the non
skin world ok and there are some skin
that you know people go and get tattooed
or something I don't know you know but
in general i'm not gonna have a clean
separation but i'm going to have a
distribution that hopefully has some
differences between them and again this
is the probability of getting that Hugh
given that it's not skin and it's not
the probability or the other way around
so all we have at the moment is the
probability of getting a hue given that
its skin probably give me Hugo's not
skin but what do we really want to do
well somebody gives us a picture this is
a stunning picture the Beatles actually
I've never seen this picture before well
that's not totally true i sought the
last time I gave this lecture but you
know what I mean anyway we get in a new
picture and what we want to do is we
want to label each pixel's being skinned
or not skin or more precisely we want to
know the probability that it's skin or
not skin given say some of the color so
do I have the probability that something
skin given its hue on this slide Megan
do I have it yes yes wrong no I have the
probability of a hue given that it's
skin right what do we have to do you
have all seen this company we're coming
where else do I get help from besides
the data I get a help from dr. Thomas
Bayes ok Bayes rule remember Bayes rule
we did Bayes rule now a couple of times
Bayes rule says that the probability
that it's skin given X and that's the
refer to as the posterior can be written
as a prior if I pull out some pixel and
I don't tell you anything about it
what's the probability of skin that's
the prior and I multiply that by the
likelihood p of x given that it is skin
now that we do have that remember those
histograms that's the probability of
getting a hue given that its skin so
that we have from the day
all right but the prior is added in here
and in fact if we remove since we've got
our measurement we can sort of pull that
out we did that last time for our
particle filtering actually we can say
that the probability that something is
skin given a measurement is the
likelihood or is proportional to the
likelihood times the prior which all
brings us to the question of where do
you get your prior from ok we've run
into this problem before and we told you
to go to get in your car drive to Greece
go to the Oracle get a prior well that's
one thing you could do but airfare
degrees is expensive so we have to do
something else and steve sites wrote
this bayes rule and use / abuse it was
kind of cute i kept the joke thanks
