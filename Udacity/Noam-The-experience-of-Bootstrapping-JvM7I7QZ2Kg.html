co-founder and I told him this is not
going anywhere we can't walk like that
we have full-time jobs he was walking it
and I in an advertising agency I was
walking I had actually two jobs I was
working as an analyst as a QA engineer
and I told him we can do it we're doing
our food our full-time jobs and then on
the nights were starting this startup
and we had just one guy doing the
programming and we expect him to do all
that walk and this is not going anywhere
with just contra preneur we just want to
be there but we need to commit we need
to burn the bridges behind us and not
really have plan B we need to have only
planet will doing this and no matter
what and we both gave notice the same
day and 56 days later we we got our
first investor so that was really the
moment that switched everything and I
probably if we didn't just quit our jobs
and and just go for it we probably
probably never completed the first
version because we were just like
postponing it forever and and that feel
that like fire that gets you going that
what really made a change for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
