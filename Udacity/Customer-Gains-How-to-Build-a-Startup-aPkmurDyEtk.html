understanding customers is understanding
customer gains which is a fancy way for
saying what are the benefits the
customers expect or desires so besides
the jobs they want to get done what do
they want to gain by using your product
or service so let's take a look so some
of the gains could be what would make
them happy is it saving money a saving
effort saving time and what do they
expect and what would go beyond their
expectations how would you delight these
customers is it quality more of
something less of something and is it
features that would delight them or
performance or or quality and what would
make your customers job or life easier
more services lower cost of ownership
flat or learning curve obviously this
depends about whether you're selling to
business customers or consumer customers
but you want to be able to make a list
or a column of all the gains that they
would get by using your product and some
more gains could be yeah is it social
conséquences doesn't make them look
good increase in power is it good design
is it specific or more features and how
do they measure success and failure is
it performance or cost and what would
increase their likelihood of adopting
your product or using it or using your
solution again is it about cost is about
lower risk is about better quality is it
because it's more fun you need to come
up with a series of hypotheses just make
that list now but you can't guess
forever you have to validate these
hypotheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
