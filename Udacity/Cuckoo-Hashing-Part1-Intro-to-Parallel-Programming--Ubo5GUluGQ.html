is based on a different hashing
algorithm not chaining and this hashing
algorithm is called cuckoo hashing this
is a cuckoo bird thanks Wikipedia and
it's termed a brood parasite but let's
put it into more understandable English
this bird is one of the biggest jerks in
the animal kingdom rather than take care
of its own eggs and chicks it instead
lays its eggs in another bird's nest
throwing out the other birds eggs to
make room and lets the other bird raise
its chicks see if you can detect why the
algorithm I'm about to describe is
called cuckoo hashing as I describe it
the key to this method is having
multiple hash tables instead of just one
multiple hash functions one per hash
table and those hash tables only allow
one item in each one of their buckets
there is no chaining in this algorithm
at all and the example will show we're
gonna have two hash tables and two hash
functions but the method generalizes to
more than two so here's what we're gonna
do at a high level first all the items
that we want to hash we use the first
hash function and try to hash into the
first hash table some of them will
collide and fail and by that I mean
we're going to try to write multiple
items into the same bucket but we're
only allowing one item per bucket that's
okay if n items try to write into one
hash bucket we only require that one of
them succeeds and it doesn't really
matter which one so then those that fail
we're going to take all the ones that
are leftover that failed and we're going
to use the second hash function to try
to hash into the second hash table and
so on now the cool part is what happens
next but we're gonna go take an example
here and I'm going to show you how it
works and then we'll see exactly how
this cuckoo hashing works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
