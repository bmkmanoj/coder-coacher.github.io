mac models and blp bell and la baje
Allah is one example of that that's the
Biba model anytime you talk about a
model you have to say you know what's
the nature of the labels how do you
compare them what kind of rules do you
have similar to what we had in the blp
model the Biba model actually is dual
off the blp model and this duality is
because rather than focusing on
confidentiality which is what blp
focuses on beaver focuses on integrity
integrity is defined you know somebody
being able to write or corrupt data the
interpretation here is that you know
when you say it's top secret information
it is really top secret information or
something like that or the information
indeed should be at that level so think
about sort of quality of information
rather than disclosure of information
that confidentially focuses on so it's
dual because the rules actually are
opposite of what we had in blp when you
concerned about information quality or
integrity you want to read up because
anything below you is lower you know
information with lower integrity you
don't want to read that so reads rot in
blp you have read down here you're going
to have read up in the BU model vlp you
have right up in bieber you have right
down so if you're at a certain level
while the unit integrity of the
information that you can create and then
write is either at your level or it's
less integrity than the level at which
you are so you're able to write down
again we not concerned about
confidential to your disclosure here we
concerned about information integrity
okay so let's look at an example to
clarify this a bit let's say integrity
could be you know high integrity medium
integrity or low integrity so I saying
information quality I think of your
favourite newspaper that you trust a lot
let's say you know for me it may be led
to the New York Times you know the
information that appears there is highly
likely that you know I can trust it your
supermarket tabloid let's say it's at
the other end policies to anyone
who may be a fan of those you talk about
confidentially anyone it's it's not
about controlling you know who can see
it it's controlling you know how good
the information is so here it's high
medium or low compartment could be
similar to be out with and what the
information is about relates the topics
of the document that that contains that
information so so label here so anytime
I talk about a model I said I want to
talk about what does the label look like
so you know high medium low is ordered
again totally ordered compartments
partially ordered because they are sets
and the model says low integrity
information should never flow into high
integrity documents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
