about that is if we have a group of
people and I won't try to draw a hundred
people but let's say we have for Alice
needs a pairwise key with Bob she needs
a pairwise key with Charlie and she
needs a pairwise key with Daniel that's
three keys for Alice and so that's the
number of people minus one since she
doesn't need a key with herself Bob
already has a pairwise key with Alice he
needs one with Colleen or maybe that was
Charlie and he needs one with Doug so
Bob needs to pairwise keys which is n
minus one minus one since he already has
one with Alice and he doesn't need one
with himself and that keeps going until
we get to the last person who already
has keys shared with everyone and won't
need a new key so we could compute that
in Python and this would compute the sum
of the numbers from 0 to 99 which is
4950 we could also compute this using
the formula we have n minus one plus one
that's n times n minus one over two
occurrences of that so that would be
equal to 100 x 99 / 2 which is the same
answer we got by summing all the numbers
using Python so this means the number of
keys that we need scales as the square
of the number of people so if we think
about doing this for a group of people
as large as the Internet where we say
have 10 to the 9 or a billion people we
would need 10 of 18 keys to have
pairwise keys between each pair this is
a ridiculously large number of keys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
