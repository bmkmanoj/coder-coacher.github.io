management of data and metadata it's
useful to look at the structure of a
traditional NFS server which is
centralized in a traditional centralized
NFS server what you have is the data
blocks are residing on the disks so in
the memory of the server the contents
include the metadata for the files like
the inode structures and file cache
which is files that have been brought in
from the disk are stored in the memory
in what is called the file cache so that
future requests for the same files can
be served from the memory of the server
rather than going to the disk and the
server also keeps the client caching
directly that is who on the local area
network are currently accessing files
that is the propriety of this particular
server and in a UNIX file system the
server is unconcerned about the
semantics of file sharing or in other
words the assumption is that the server
is caching for each client completely
independently and therefore if clients
happen to share a file that is
completely the problem of the clients
and the server is not concerned about
that so all of these contents that I
just described to you
metadata file cache client caching
directory all of these are in the memory
of a particular server and if this
server happens to be housing hot files
used by a lot of users that is being
served by this particular server then
that's bad news for the server in terms
of scalability because it has to worry
about the requests simultaneously coming
from lots of clients for these hot files
and so it is constrained by the
bandwidth that's available to access the
files from the disk it is constrained by
the amount of memory space it's got for
caching files and the metadata of the
files and so on
at the same time there could be an other
server that also has adequate bandwidth
to the storage and memory space but
unfortunately it may be housing cold
files and therefore there are not many
clients for this server so you can
immediately see
that this sort of centralization with
the traditional file system results in
hotspots and that's the thing that we're
trying to avoid in a distributed file
system and that's where dynamic
management comes into play
so in XFS it provides the same
functionality as a centralized NFS
server but it is distributed and the
metadata management is dynamic and that
is in a centralized file server the
mapping between the manager node for a
file and the location of the file is the
same or in other words if the file
happens to reside on the disk of this
server then this server is the guy that
is going to handle the metadata
management for this file as well on the
other hand in XFS metadata management is
dynamically distributed so let's say
that you have F 1 F 2 and F 3 of the
heart files in that case metadata
management for files F 2 and F 3 can be
done by some of them known say s3 and
this server may have the cache for the
file so in other words all the data
structures that we talked about that has
to reside in the memory of a particular
server like metadata file cache and the
caching information about who's having
the files and so on all of that can be
distributed with dynamic management of
data and metadata which is the idea in
XFS and I'll shortly explain how exactly
this dynamic management is facilitated
by the implementation of XFS so in any
systems research there is always first
the idea and then there is an
implementation so the idea in XFS is
that we want to manage the data and
metadata management dynamically and
we'll see how that is done and also what
we want to do is we don't want the cache
for the files to be only at the server
what we would like to be able to do is
if a file is accessed by several
different nodes then they're living in
the client caches of the different nodes
if a file is residing in the
- of a pure node then it makes sense
that if a new request comes for the same
file then getting that file from a peer
cache may be much more efficient than
getting it from the disk and that way we
can also conserve the total amount of
memory that's available in the servers
and use it more frugally by exploiting
the memories that are available in the
clients so that the caching of the files
can be done cooperatively among the
clients and that's the other nugget in
the technical contribution of XFS is the
cooperative client Kashi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
