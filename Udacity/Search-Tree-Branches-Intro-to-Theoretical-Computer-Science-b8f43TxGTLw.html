we can find structures like this in our
graph and here can be other connections
possibly don't have to be but we'll
ignore those for now now if we look at
this structure from a brute force
perspective there are eight different
possibilities for assigning or not
assigning these vertices here into a
vertex cover so the eight possibilities
are as follows either we can take no
vertex at all into the vertex cover and
you already know that this is going to
cause a problem and we could take all of
them into the vertex cover and then
there are six more combinations so a
brute force search tree would look at
eight possible assignments so out of
these eight assignments if you were to
design a search tree that directly
branches into these cases here there's
only five cases that would even make
sense please check which of these cases
would make sense for search tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
