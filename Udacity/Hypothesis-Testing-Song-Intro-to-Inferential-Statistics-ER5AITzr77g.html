let's say that I want to bring up this
ratio so I want more people to watch
more of the lessons so I'm going to
spice things up well unless in nine
you're going to learn how to formally
determine whether or not something had
an effect this is called hypothesis
testing and I'm thinking about writing a
song on how hypothesis testing works and
then singing it for you in the next
lesson like for example do you remember
learning the quadratic formula x equals
negative b plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a and
those are the roots of a quadratic
function some people learned it in
middle school as a song and maybe that
made learning it a lot more fun so I'm
thinking about writing a song on
hypothesis testing and by the way this
is no joke I'm seriously considering
this however I don't want to run the
risk of a song hurting rather than
helping your engagement with the course
material so maybe I'll create the next
lesson with the song but only make it
available to a random sample of 20
students and I won't force them to watch
it I'll just do the same thing I always
do just make it available every week
just like I make the other lessons
available then I'll look at this ratio
let's pretend that for this sample we
get that the mean ratio is 0.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
