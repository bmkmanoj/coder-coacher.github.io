basically found interesting points in an
image and we described them we built
these descriptors these sift descriptors
we found putative matches possible
matches between them and then we did
something like grand sack or something
like that in order to find the alignment
well we can actually do something for
recognition that's related now
essentially what we're gonna do is say
we're gonna do the same thing we're
gonna find interesting points where
these are sort of highly repeatable
points that you'll find and what we're
gonna talk about is describing the
patches around those points and then
we're gonna use the collection of those
described patches as a way of generally
characterizing the image for recognition
so as we talked about before each
location in an image so here we have
different locations in an image all
right and a bunch of different training
images and each one of these has a
descriptor that and this what these
curves are meant to show is that they
land somewhere in feature space so this
they land in the descriptors feature
space and you can imagine that you get a
collection of these so that there's a
whole bunch of descriptors in a given
image and then we're gonna make the
following assumption and we actually
made this assumption before right we
assume that when we have points that are
sort of similar in the descriptor space
that they are or nearby in the
descriptor space that those patches are
either the same patch in a new image or
a similar patch so one way of thinking
about this is it's a way of just giving
a description of a little bit of local
content in the image and so now if I get
a new picture that comes in right I can
say let me find the patches in it and
see if I find lots of the same local
patches that were in my first image and
say okay if I find a lot of those then I
would know that maybe this new picture
is the same thing maybe same category
same object as the first picture the
problem of course is that any given
picture can have thousands of patches so
a collection of different objects and
different images there could be millions
of these things
and the problem is if I come up with a
new image and I find a patch in it I
have this problem of possibly having to
search over millions of different
patches I have to do something a little
more clever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
