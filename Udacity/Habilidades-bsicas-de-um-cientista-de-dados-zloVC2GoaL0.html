data scientist needs to have substantive
expertise what does that mean well
typically it means that a data scientist
knows which questions to ask can
interpret the data well and understands
the structure of the data you can
imagine that a data scientist needs to
know about the problem they're solving
for example if you're solving an online
advertising problem you want to make
sure you understand what types of people
are coming to your website how they're
interacting with the website and what
different data means that can help you
ask the right questions like our people
falling off and not completing our ads
at a certain point in the flow or do
people complete more ads at a certain
time of day you would also then be very
familiar with how the data is stored and
structured and that could help you work
more efficiently and more effectively
this is why it's important for a data
scientist to have substantive expertise
it's important to note that data
scientists usually work in teams so it's
normal for data scientists to be
stronger in some areas and weaker and
others so even if you as a data
scientist don't have tons of substantive
expertise if you have great hacking
skills or know a lot of statistics you
can still be a valuable member of a data
science team</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
