the same tool we have been using to
validate or individual models to compare
all three of our models side-by-side the
model comparison tool so as you see on
the canvas we have all three models
already built out since we've done that
already what I'm going to do now is
Union the three model objects together
and then load those into the model
comparison report so I'm able to
determine which model actually performs
better by looking at them side-by-side
so let's bring in now a union tool to
Union the three model objects in
together then I'll bring in a model
comparison tool and load the Union
results of the model objects into the M
or model input for the model comparison
tool and the validation data set goes
into then the d.r data side let's bring
in a browse tool after the our output
and let's kick off this workflow so now
that this ran let's open up this result
output so we can go and interpret the
results what we're able to see here is
all the models side by side for their
fit and error measures so we're able to
determine each of the individual models
total accuracy with that validation data
set as well as how well each of the
models performed at trying to predict
each mode of transportation within that
validation data set the other thing
we're able to look at is the confusion
matrixes of each of the different models
with that validation data set to see if
there's any trends or biases within this
model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
