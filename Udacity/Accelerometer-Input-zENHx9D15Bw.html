flexible and intuitive way for your user
to interact with your game the
accelerometer reports the phone's
acceleration in meters per second
squared so if the phone is stationary
the only acceleration that's
experiencing is the acceleration due to
gravity which is equal to about 9.8
meters per second squared this sounded
all familiar from physics class now
regardless of the orientation used by
your game the accelerometer data is
reported as though the phone is in
portrait orientation with the positive
z-axis coming out of the screen that
means if the z axis of the accelerometer
is reading about 9.8 the phone is flat
on its back if the z-axis is reading
negative 9.8 then the phone is resting
on its face if the y axis reads 9.8 then
the phone is upright in the portrait
orientation now we've tilted the phone a
little bit and now the y axis is reading
positive if we tilt the phone this way a
little bit now the x axis is reading
positive libgdx allows you to pull for
accelerometer readings using GDX input
get accelerometer x y&amp;amp;z we can compute
the total acceleration using the good
old Pythagorean theorem down here we're
drawing those red bars you saw and this
is actually the horizontal bar notice
that the exposition of the end of that
bar is being determined by the negative
y-axis that's because we're looking at
this game in landscape mode and all of
the accelerometer readings are reported
as though the phone was in portrait mode
here is the vertical line and the end of
that line is determined by the positive
x-axis you'll get a hold of this quickly
enough but if everything is sliding
sideways in your game this is probably
why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
