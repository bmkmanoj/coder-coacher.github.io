Robin's pushing force we broke it into
an X and a y component we had to do some
trig but that was okay speaking of
breaking things down what if Robin
succeeds what if she breaks this wall
apart the force provided by the wall
well of course it has to go away and
what do we have now now we have
unbalanced forces and when I say
unbalanced what I mean is that this
force doesn't have a companion force to
the left we are now entering the world
of acceleration now how do we solve the
problem of what is this carts
acceleration going to be what we already
know that these two forces balance this
force so there's not going to be any
vertical acceleration ay y will equal
zero ax on the other hand will not equal
zero it will equal something much more
interesting and let's calculate well
it's as simple as saying F equals MA but
now the only force we're using is the
unbalanced force and that's equal to
86.6 nunes I know the mass is 10 and
when I solve I get a equals 8.66 meters
per second squared sorry I did that one
all on my own you'll have a chance to
this next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
