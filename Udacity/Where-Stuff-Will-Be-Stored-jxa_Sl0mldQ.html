allowed to save information let's look
at those three subfolders we mentioned
earlier documents this is where you save
important information iTunes will make
backups of this folder and the US will
never delete its contents caches this is
for temporary info iTunes and iCloud
will never make a backup of its contents
library is generally for any files you
don't want exposed to the user we don't
need to worry about this folder for now
but in case you were curious that's what
it is therefore the rule of thumb is
important stuff goes into documents
things that won't be necessary in the
future or easy to recreate should go
into caches in order to save something
in the sandbox we need to do two things
first find where the folder is within
the sandbox and then write your file
within that folder to achieve this we
will use the following classes and it's
file manager to get the path to the
folder within the sandbox and then
string to write or read text files or NS
data to write or read binary files
enough talk let's move to Xcode and
write some code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
