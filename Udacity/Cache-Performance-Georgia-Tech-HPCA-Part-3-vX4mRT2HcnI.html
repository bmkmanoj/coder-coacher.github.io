good cache or what are the properties of
a good cache
we want our system to have a good
average memory access time or a matte
and this is the access time to memory as
seen by the processor the a matte is
equal to the cache is hid time how
quickly can it return the data when we
do have a cache hit + how often do we
have a miss times the Miss penalty we
want the a matte to be very low the
lower the better this means that we want
the hit time to below which means we
want a small and fast cache because that
will contribute to having this below we
want a low miss rate which means we want
our cache to be large and or smart if
it's a large cache more stuff will fit
in it so we will miss less often or if
it's smart it will know better what to
keep inside so again we will have fewer
misses the miss penalty for simple
caches is simply the main memory access
time this is going to be very large
usually tens or even hundreds of
processor cycles so really when we're
designing caches we're trying to balance
the hit time in the Miss rate small and
fast versus large and intelligent and
intelligent typically means slightly
slower so some caches can be extremely
small and fast have very good hit time
but sometimes that's at expense of
having a larger miss rate some caches
will have a relatively large hit time
but extremely low miss rates so that we
can reduce the overall contribution of
main memory accesses that contribute a
lot each time we have them sometimes we
also talk about miss time which is the
overall time it takes to have a cache
miss a miss time is simply the hit time
followed by the Miss penalty because we
try to find what we have in the cache
but fail and then we still have to pay
the miss penalty we can also think about
miss time is the memory access time when
we are missing so
miss rate is one so again it will be hit
time plus the Miss penalty so another
way to write the a math expression would
be to say that it is 1 minus Miss rate
times the hit time so this is how often
do we have the hits times the time for
the hit plus how often do we have the
misses times the Miss time usually we
want to use this expression simply
because the Miss time typically includes
checking whether what we have is in the
cache followed by whatever we need to do
on a Miss so somehow every time we will
have the time it takes to hit but
sometimes we will also pay the Miss
penalty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
