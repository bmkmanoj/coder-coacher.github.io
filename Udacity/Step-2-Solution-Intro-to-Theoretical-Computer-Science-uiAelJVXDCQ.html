right from the last unit is that we need
to take some and P complete problem and
show that we can use shortest tour to
solve that problem so this one appear is
correct because as I told you a
reduction basically means that we show
that this NP complete problem here and
we still have to choose a good one kind
of fits into shortest tour so shortest
tour is at least as hard to solve as
this one up here if it were the other
way around then you would just show that
this NP complete problem is at least as
hard to solve as shortest tour but that
doesn't give you any statement about
shortest tour so this is the way we need
to do the reduction now it says some
complete NP problem here so the question
of course is which one is it going to be
and later in this unit I'm going to show
you a bunch of resources that you can
use to find suitable NP complete
problems to do your reduction because
when you have a very similar problem and
that's what you've seen with vertex
cover and independent set then the
reduction becomes much easier to do and
we saw with SAT and click for example
that if you have problems that are a bit
different then you might run into
trouble so I'll give you those resources
but here's a general rule if you don't
find an np-complete problem that is very
similar to the one where you're trying
to prove that it is np-complete then
usually it's a good idea to start with
sat because SAT is a very well in a way
very flexible and very universal NP
complete problem so that's exactly what
we're going to do here as well we're
going to try to reduce SAT to shortest
tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
