can configure the initial state of the
map in a number of ways for
documentation and all of the ways you
can configure it using XML attributes
look in the instructor notes below
but for now we'll configure a few
attributes to show something interesting
so here's the layout that you had just
created with your fragment containing
the map's fragment and this gave you the
default Google Maps that you've been
using throughout but what we're going to
do is we're going to change this so
we're going to take a look at New York
City with a flyover type view so first
of all there's going to be a number of
attributes on the fragment that we're
going to need to set and we're going to
do these using the maps namespace so we
need to tell the XML about the Maps
namespace first so I'm going to do that
up here and you see we have xml
namespace tool equals this we're going
to create a new XML namespace from map
and here are the details for the XML
namespace for map as you can see xmlns
colon map is equal to HTTP schemas
android comm slash apk slash res auto so
this will give us the map attributes
that we can now add to our fragment map
attributes will consist of things such
as the latitude and the longitude of
what you want to look at so the latitude
and longitude of the area in New York
City we're going to look at a loud now
here you can see I've added the map
camera target latitude and map camera
type camera target longitude don't worry
about the red underlines on them at the
moment now when you're looking in a map
you actually look at a map through a
virtual camera so you tell the camera
the target latitude and longitude that
it's going to look at so the latitude of
like downtown New York City is forty
point seven four eight four and the
longitude is negative seventy three
point nine eight five seven but what
this is going to do is if you remember
when you first ran the map you had a
view from high in orbit looking down on
the earth and this will do that but
it'll be looking down in New York City
but all it's going to do is shift the
camera from being high in orbit looking
down and the equator to being high in
orbit looking down in New York City so
we also want to move the camera so we
zoom down onto New York City and we'll
change a couple of things I'm gonna add
them and then talk through them one by
one
so these are the three attributes that
I've added the first is the camera
bearing the camera bearing is the
direction that the camera is looking at
with zero degrees being looking nor
180 degrees being looking south so as a
result you can see I'm looking at 112
point five degrees so I'm kind of
looking east with my camera bearing next
is going to be the camera tilt so if you
can imagine the camera when it's looking
straight down it's going to be tilted at
90 degrees but if I can change that to
65 degrees then the camera is going to
be appearing somewhat at an angle
looking down so we have a nice 3d
isometric view of the world beneath us
and then finally is the camera zoom the
larger the number the closer you are to
the surface of the earth so if you can
imagine with camera zoom zero that's
what we've had all along with the camera
is way up looking down on the earth
border camera zoom 17 I'm going down
really close to the earth and as you'll
see because I've got a camera tilt of 65
degrees I'm getting a 3d view of the
skyscrapers in New York City where the
camera zoom being 17 I'm actually lower
than the level of some of these
skyscrapers so let's run the application
and see what it looks like so now here
we see the application running on my
tablet it gives us a view of downtown
New York and I can actually scroll
around and see the city in three
dimensions so I can see some of the
skyscrapers that are cylindrical in
shape and as we had earlier on we were
actually looking at the base of the
Empire State Building and here you can
see the Empire State Building rising out
of the view of the camera because the
camera is actually lower than the height
of the building as i zoom around New
York City and I pan around we can take a
look at some of the interesting features
and some of the buildings for example
here's the United Nations headquarters
overlooking the river and here are
things like some of the islands in the
river itself and we can see the
skyscrapers on them sometimes it takes a
little while for them to show up so
you've effectively gotten all of this
for free you didn't need to set up
anything to get the 3d views or anything
like that just basically by the fact
that you're tilted the camera and you
were close enough into the earth to be
able to see the 3d views if I were to
zoom out you'll see I'm just gonna see
now a pond view of New York City without
the 3d as a zoom out you can see we were
you know facing towards the east looking
out over Long Island when i zoom in over
the city again once I get close enough
we'll start seeing the buildings and the
skyscrapers popping up and there they
are pretty simple just all of this was
done just by setting attributes on the
map fragment pretty cool right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
