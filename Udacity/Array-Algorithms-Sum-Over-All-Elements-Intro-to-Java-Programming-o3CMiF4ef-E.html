some common algorithms I'll explain to
you the problem that we want to solve
I'll explain to you the general
algorithm and then I'll leave it to you
to implement it in Java and then we'll
talk together about the implementation
let's start with the algorithm to
compute the sum of values in an
ArrayList suppose we have a bunch of
pictures that we want to arrange
horizontally the total width of all of
them depends on the sum of the widths of
all of the individual ones to compute
the sum will of course need a variable
to hold it and I'll just write it in
pseudocode here now for each element in
the array add to the sum to measure off
that element and I'm writing it in this
generic form so that you can reuse the
algorithm for other situations in our
case the element is a picture in the
ArrayList of pictures and the measure is
the width and here we're summing up the
various widths but in other situations
you may be wanting to compute the sum of
other things maybe the prices of some
articles so that's the general algorithm
now your job will be to complete code
for the specific case of summing the
width of pictures so here I've set up
the ArrayList of pictures for you here
is a statement to print the result and
your job will be to put in the Java code
for the algorithm that I just described
have a go at it and then we'll compare
notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
