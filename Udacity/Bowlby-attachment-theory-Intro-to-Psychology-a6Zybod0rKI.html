psychologist by the name of John Bowlby
developed a theory called attachment and
this was based on two observations the
first observation was made by the animal
behaviorist Konrad Lorenz and Lorenz had
seen in baby geese that whoever cared
for them became their mother that's not
all that weird until you realized that
the mother could be a human didn't have
to be a goose and this is what he called
imprinting the second observation was
made by Sigmund Freud and Freud had
observed that when mothers go away from
babies that the baby becomes really
distressed really upset and this he
called separation anxiety
so it was imprinting on the one hand and
separation anxiety on the other hand
that led John Bowlby to develop a theory
for why attachment to the caregiver is
so important in early stages of human
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
