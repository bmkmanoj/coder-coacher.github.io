distorted really the problem is that
you're not sitting close enough to the
screen it's sort of like being
overweight I could instead say I'm not
dense enough if I was denser then I'd
look thinner think of what the field of
view represents when you look at your
monitor tablet or mobile device you're a
given distance away from it the screen
itself is a certain height this forms a
real world field of view angle a window
on your screen is your window into a
virtual world say this window in the
real world has a 20 degree field of view
for your real world eye position if your
virtual world also has the same field of
view you won't perceive any distortion
objects toward the edge of the screen
might look distorted if you were to back
away from the screen but at your current
I position the field of view is perfect
the images worked a bit in projection
but your eye is seeing the screen at a
tilt that compensates for it
the formula for height for a given field
of view and distance from the screen is
height equals two times tangent of the
field of view divided by 2
don't forget to use radians times the
distance as the field of view increases
the tangent value increases and so the
height of the monitor increases what
tends to happen in video games is that
the designer cranks up the virtual
worlds field of view so that the players
can see more of what's happening around
them this can certainly lead to a more
playable game but this is also where the
distortion comes from from the fact that
the virtual field of view doesn't match
the real world field of view if you
moved your point of view so that you
were at the apex of the virtual worlds
frustum right here the virtual world
would appear undistorted of course it
might actually all be blurry at this
distance or you might get a massive
headache but that's the theory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
