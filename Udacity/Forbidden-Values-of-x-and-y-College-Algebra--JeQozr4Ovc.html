we end up with looking at the
denominator X can equals 0 2 or 1 so
I'll write those values in this box to
tell us about the domain X can't equal 0
1 or 2 great that takes care of half the
problem now on to the range let's look
at our horizontal asymptote if there is
one at all first though I need to
multiply out what's in the numerator and
the denominator so we have a form that
we can use for long division in the
numerator I'll have X cubed minus X and
in the denominator we have 2 X to the
4th minus 6 X cubed plus 4x squared
great now we can divide setting up our
long division problem I need to see how
many times 2 X to the 4th goes into X
cubed well that's just a zero times I
could carry on with my long division but
I know already that we're going to have
a horizontal asymptote at y equals 0 now
the question is is this an asymptote
that the function crosses or not to find
out let's plug in 0 for Y in our
function I know that this equation will
be satisfied if the numerator is just
equal to 0 as long as the denominator is
not undefined at whatever value of x we
need to do this so let's just set x
times x squared minus 1 equal to 0 two
of these factors X and X minus 1 are
also in the denominator so I'm going to
cross them out but we still have one
left over X plus 1 this means that at x
equals negative 1 the graph of our
function crosses through the horizontal
asymptote since the horizontal asymptote
then is not restricting our range the
range is just all the real numbers so we
can write a nun in this box awesome
that was a super complicated quiz so if
you got through it great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
