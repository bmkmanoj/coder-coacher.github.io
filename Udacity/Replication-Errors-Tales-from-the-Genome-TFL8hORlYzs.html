really screw up a coding region but
where do they come from well mutations
can come from lots of different places
but these types in particular
predominately come from replication
errors so do you mean like the DNA is
actually replicated exactly inside a
cell there's molecular machinery
responsible doing all the work for
replicating the DNA and sometimes it
makes a mistake does it fix its mistakes
it does your body does a good job at
fixing mistakes but even after fixing
all those mistakes it still misses some
and you have a mutation rate of about
one in every 300 million letters I like
those odds that doesn't sound that bad
it's true doesn't sound too bad until
you consider that there are three
billion letters in the human genome and
you've got six billion counting both
copies in every cell so that turns out
at about 60 new mutations every time a
cell divides that really does build up
it does build up over time but those
mutations are great new source of
variation for new alleles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
