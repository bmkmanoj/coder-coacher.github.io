we use our genetic code we see that the
first codon is TAC so I'm going to look
here you a C and that's tyrosine which
we symbolize with why I'm going to take
the next one ctg see you G which would
be loosing or l and then I'm going to
take the last one which is jejeje and
look for ji ji ji glycine which is
symbolized with the G so the answer is
yl g now what I hope none of you got
tricked by is the fact that I gave you
the DNA sequence not the RNA sequence
this is a coding region of DNA that will
eventually be transcribed into the mRNA
that it the same positions will say UAC
see you ji ji ji ji and so on and we'll
have these three codons but remember
when the coding region is copied into
the RNA intermediate the mRNA the thigh
means or the T's are replaced by use and
that's why our genetic code uses use is
because technically the code that's
being translated is not the DNA but the
RNA that's being turned into protein the
RNA is the intermediate and the DNA is
where that RNA came from so although i
give you the original DNA sequence you
should be able to figure out the protein
by simply replacing the thigh means with
yourselves Ortiz with use and then
reading the codons and that format
translating it from the genetic code
into the protein sequence that you would
get right here so in this case in the
ABO gene from position 793 to position
80 one of the genetic code the coding
region of the gene we would get three
amino acids from three codons totaling
nine nucleotides tyrosine or why L for
leucine and G for glycine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
