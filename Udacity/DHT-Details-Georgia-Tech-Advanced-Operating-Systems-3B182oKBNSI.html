the DHT technology the first name space
that the DHT technology has to deal with
is the key space namespace so the way
name space is managed is if you have
content to disseminate you generate a
unique key for that content by using
some algorithm like sha-1 which
generates a hundred and sixty bit key
the number of bits in the key or the
signature is big enough that they will
not be collision even if different
content are using the same algorithm to
generate this key so that is how you
create a unique signature for a
particular content using sha-1 the
second namespace we have to deal with is
a node space so here what we are doing
is we are creating an sha-1 hash of IP
addresses of nodes that want to share
content so let's say that me and my
buddies form a social network and all
our IP addresses we are going to use
this algorithm to encode them into this
160 bit node ID so now we've got two
namespaces one is the key space
namespace and the node space namespace
and both of them are derived using the
same algorithmic technique let's say so
in this case we have created a key for
the content so that there's a unique
signature for a particular content
similarly we've created a node ID from
the IP address which is again a unique
signature for a particular IP address
the objective is if I have a key I want
to store that key in a node ID n such
that the key is very close to the node
ID n ideally if you're lucky the key is
exactly equal to end but you know it's
not possible to guarantee that this hash
and this hash will result in exactly the
same value so long as it is close enough
like in the previous example I showed
you that if I generated a hash 149 I
stored it in a node 150 which is close
enough to the hash that I created so the
API for manipulate
the distributed hash table data
structure would be put key and get key
so put key will take two arguments the
key and the value value can be anything
that you want to associate with that in
the previous example I said the value
may be the IP address of the content
that is associated with the particular
key and gate key takes one argument
namely the key and returns the value
that is associated with that key value
pair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
