of your interactive debugger you're
stepping through the program you're
looking at the variables
you're stepping and stepping and
stepping you're setting up breakpoints
trying to figure out what's going on and
now time passes you sit in front of your
screen you dig through the code step by
step by step by step and you watch
individual variables appear and
disappear time passes it's late so you
order a pizza maybe a cup of coffee you
keep on watching at the screen have some
more coffee and just keep on stepping
and stepping through your program as
time goes by it's pretty late already
and you keep on concentrating stepping
you are so close that's when the phone
rings brain brain brain who's on the
phone who's on the phone well simple
it's a significant other asking you when
on earth are you planning to come home
you are in a lose-lose situation you
either lose your concentration or you
lose your significant other you have 30
seconds left
until you lose all the concentration you
have so carefully build up you have 30
seconds to decide what to do I know a
fair amount of programmers who when
faced with such a problem have taken the
only right decision and I think that
debugging is the number one divorce
ground for programmers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
