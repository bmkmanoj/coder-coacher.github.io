the numerator and denominator by the
conjugate of this denominator the
conjugate of root 2 plus root 5 is root
2 minus root 5 we distribute the 6 to
each of these terms to get 6 root 2
minus 6 root 5 next we use our
difference of squares factoring pattern
to do a squared minus B squared we
square root 2 to get to and we square
root 5 to get 5 next we subtract in our
denominator to get a denominator of
negative 3 and here's we want to be
careful when we simplify we can divide
negative 3 into this term and this term
6 divided by negative 3 is negative 2
and negative 6 divided by negative 3 is
positive 2 this is how we get our answer
of negative 2 root 2 plus 2 root 5
another way to think about it is to
factor a negative 3 from each of these
terms if we factor our negative 3 from
this first term will be left with
negative 2 times root 2 and we factor
out negative 3 from this term will be
left with 2 root 5 we can check this
really quickly by distributing this
negative 3 to each of these terms will
wind up with our numerator from before
now that we have a common factor of
negative 3 in the numerator and the
denominator we can simplify these
reduced to 1 which leaves us with just
our numerator negative 2 root 2 plus 2
root 5 and now there are a couple of
ways to write this answer you could have
factored a negative 2 out to get this
answer or you could have factored a
positive 2 out either of these is
correct nice algebraic thinking if you
got any of these answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
