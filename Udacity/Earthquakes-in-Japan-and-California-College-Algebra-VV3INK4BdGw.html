problem we're going to look at two
earthquakes one of them happened in
Japan in 2011 this earthquake had a
magnitude of 9.0 the other growth quake
we're going to talk about happened in
California it was in 1857 and it had a
magnitude of 7.9 this is the largest
known earthquake in California now what
do these numbers actually mean well
let's talk about the equation for the
magnitude of an earthquake let's say
that r is the magnitude of an earthquake
on the Richter scale then for our we
have the equation R equals log base 10
of I over s here I is the intensity of
the earthquake and s is equal to some
constant it's supposed to be the
intensity of some sort of standard
earthquake which just has a fixed value
we don't need to know this value though
since will be eliminating it from our
equations eventually so here once again
is our information about our two
earthquakes how does this information
fall into an equation of this sort well
we know that r is the magnitude that
means that over here for Japan will have
nine point 0 equals log base 10 of j / s
I'm just going to use the letter j
instead of I to show that this is the
intensity of the Japanese earthquake for
California it will have something very
similar we're just going to instead have
an r-value of 7.9 and I'll use the
letter C to represent the intensity of
this quake see for California now notice
that in both of these log equations we
have a fraction as the input to the log
what we're going to want to do first is
to split each of these up into two
separate logs since otherwise we're not
going to be able to get rid of the S so
which property do we need to use in
order to do that should we use the
product property the quotient property
the power property or the change of base
property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
