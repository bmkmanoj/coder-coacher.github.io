getting sick of writing out a million
and one so I'm just going to do 11 now
okay so you see when we run this we get
what's called a generator object and
says Gen X / and that's some memory
location okay so we've created a
generator object let's see what we can
do with it let's actually make an
assignment here so now G is this
generator object and basically all it
means to be a generator object is that
this object can be iterated over which
basically means we can call this next
function on it so if I call next on G
hit enter i get 0 that's 0 squared yes I
would expect now if I do it again one
which is 1 squared and so on until i get
to 10 which is the last number in my
range and then of course stop iteration
as you saw in class but next isn't the
only function that does this sort of
iteration so let's reassign G because
now that we've gotten to the stop
iteration G is sort of spent so we've
reassigned it and let's take the sum of
G and some performs the iteration for us
we could also do a for loop and that
does exactly what we'd expect so how
else can we get one of these generator
objects besides using a generator
expression well we can define a function
and this function gin squares does the
exact same thing is our previous
generator expression so note this yield
statement this is interesting this is
what makes this a generator function and
not a normal function of course if we
call Jen squares right now we'll see
that this is a function but the reason
why I behaves differently is because of
this yield statement and basically the
main difference between you in return is
that when a generator reaches a yield
statement it suspends execution and
remembers the state of all local
variables and that's really important
this memory of the local variables
allows it to pick up where it left off
when we call for example next on it
again so we have our generator function
how can we get a generator object out of
that well we just have to call the
function let's call it with an argument
of I don't know let's say 11 there we go
there's our generator object just like
before we can call next here we get 0
Essex
did if I call next one more time what do
you think the output will be do you
think the app will be 0 14 or 121</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
