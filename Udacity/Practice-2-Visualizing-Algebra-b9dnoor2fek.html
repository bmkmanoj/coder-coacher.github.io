is negative infinity to negative 1 Union
4 to infinity how did you do did you get
it right if so great work let's see how
we got that once again I'm going to
solve these inequalities independently
and i'm going to start skipping a step
or two when i'm solving this inequality
i want to subtract 3x from both sides
which gives me 3x plus 5 is less than 2
subtracting 5 from both sides gives me
3x is less than negative 3 divide both
sides by 3 and i get x is less than
negative 1 when i solve this inequality
i'm going to skip the steps where i'm
showing what I'm adding or subtracting
to each side of the equation in other
words here i want to subtract x from
both sides when i subtract X from 2x I'm
simply left with X plus 7 on the left
side and when i subtract x from the
right side x minus x is 0 so i get x
plus 7 is 11 and when i subtract seven
from both sides i get x is greater than
11-7 which is for i have x is less than
negative 1 or x is greater than 4 let's
see what that looks like on a number
line when i graph the solution of x is
less than negative 1 on the number line
I have a parentheses it's less than and
I know it's going to the left because
it's less than similarly X is greater
than 4 we put a parenthesis at four and
since it's greater than we're going to
the right the solution on the number
line makes it really easy to write in
interval notation since this arrow is
going off to negative infinity we start
at negative infinity and we have to stop
at negative 1 since it's an or we have a
union and then we start up again at four
and the arrow is going to positive
infinity let's go ahead and try one more
compound inequality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
