and cannot e between frames and use the
the the shin tomasi way of finding
features small displacements but what if
there are large displacements what if
things have moved a lot because they're
moving quickly well one thing we do is
we do know that we can build a
descriptor remember the sift descriptor
so that if you found a matching point
I'd be able to say yeah I'm pretty sure
that's a match but the question was how
would I decide where to find it so when
we were doing the ransack method of
finding those panoramas you remember we
essentially compared all of these with
all of those found the putative matches
selected a bunch and then tried to find
something that would gave us a
consistent model so you're doing a lot
of work in order to try to globally find
all of these kinds of things for
tracking what we want is well first of
all we typically want real-time methods
because we want this thing to operate as
things are moving along and in
particular we we want this notion of a
coherent tracked result right so we're
not going to try to match everything and
one frame to everything another and then
do it again and then do it again and do
it again and do it see so you just saw
my head rotating around I hope you
paying attention so the idea is that you
have this smooth coherent trajectory and
that's what we want to do for tracking
and in order to do that we have to worry
about the dynamics that is how are
things moving how are they changing so
when we do tracking with dynamics the
key idea is we've got some sort of model
of the motion and maybe we're updating
that model like the velocity of the
acceleration but using that model we
want to predict where the objects will
be in the next frame and then we're
going to look around that area okay and
that prediction will allow us to
restrict where we're doing the search
and the other thing is if we have a
noisy detection that is our ability to
know where this thing is is not perfect
we should actually get a better overall
estimate because we're combining a
prediction with the measurement so
that's the idea of tracking with
dynamics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
