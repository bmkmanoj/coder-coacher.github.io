patterns that are typical when
developing their social and
communication skills if you recall from
our lesson on development here we see
that these children do not reach the
same milestone markers in the areas of
social skills and communication as
you're typically developing children
some of the symptoms or signs of AAS
include making little eye contact
failing to respond to other people
tending to look and listen less to
people and to their environment and
responding unusually when other people
show signs of anger distress or
affection children with ASD seem not to
respond appropriately as defined by
prevailing social norms - emotional cues
and human social interactions in
addition some children with ASD also
engaged in repetitive actions that are
termed stereo Tippie or stereotyped
behaviors stereotyped behavior can be
defined as persistent mechanical
repetition of speech or movement or
ritualistic movements like hand flapping
or Rocking the number of individuals
diagnosed with ASD has increased
throughout the years and currently rates
are approximately 60 per 1000 births why
do you think there's been an increase in
the number of children being diagnosed
with ASD think about it for a moment and
