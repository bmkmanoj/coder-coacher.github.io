and in fact the null hypothesis is
correct but one problem with ANOVA is
that we can only tell if at least one
pair is significantly different that's
what makes our statistic big we have one
statistic that's either big or small if
we get a small statistic we know that
the within-subject variability is large
relative to the between-subject
variability and none of the means are
significantly different from each other
in that case we would accept the null
hypothesis but if we get a large
statistic the opposite is true the
between-subject variability is large
relative to the within-subject
variability in other words we might have
some samples and the means are different
from each other relative to each
variability but then we know that at
least one pair of means is significantly
different so we accept the alternative
hypothesis but we don't know which means
are causing this large between subject
variability this means that when we're
doing anova if we get a large test
statistic and reject the null there's an
extra step that involves seeing which
means are different from each other
these follow-up tests are generally
called multiple comparison tests and
you'll learn about these in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
