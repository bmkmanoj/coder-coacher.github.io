there's been a lot of new ideas that
have come into CUDA between the time you
launched five or six years ago and today
so you know what are maybe the two or
three coolest ideas that you think have
come in since the time you launched well
certainly we've added a lot of support
for managing concurrency there's no
shortage of parallelism in these in
these codes that people want to move to
the GPU so we've added support for can
better support for concurrency for
streams
we've even moved some of that from which
started out software support actually is
now baked into the hardware with the
Kepler and the hyper cue it those are
pieces of silicon they're actually
inspired by some of the stuff we were
doing in software originally with a 2.0
other stuff we've been doing is
integrating closer with the memory
hierarchy in cuda 4.0 we did the uva
work which is unifying the virtual
address space of the entire machine such
that they this was work we did sort of
tightly integrating with the operating
system such that a pointer by pointer
value the system can know if memory is
living on the cpu or living on the GPU
so there's no separate memory spaces
anymore you can simply do reference a
pointer it goes to the right machine a
right CPU or GPU or your Pierce GPU make
that made Multi GPU programming way
easier then then we had before eautiful
I mean as a professor I think usually
what I say is the most common error is
accessing memory on the wrong side of
the machine Thank You D resident seeing
a GPU pointer and it's really on the CPU
that's certainly very helpful going out
and doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
