can be the last one at some combination
of the above criteria because there's
always counter examples if you just take
a single one of them so for example a
software does something that the user
doesn't want if the software enforces
copyright protection well some people
might call that malware actually but
there are of course cases where software
does something that the user doesn't
want and it's still for a good purpose
software that deletes files no way
because you can delete files on your
computer using the normal delete command
and that is not malware gathering
information from a computer not as a
standalone criterion because they may be
software that you actually want to
gather information from your computer
disrupting other programs well sounds
like malware but on the other hand if
for example you have a anti-malware
program that disrupts malware that will
definitely disrupt or hopefully disrupt
the computer virus that is trying to
infect your system doesn't have to be
malware just because it interrupts other
programs installed without asking well
with most software having automated
updates I don't think that classifies as
malware alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
