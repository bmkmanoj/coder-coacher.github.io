within your browser some editors like
brackets come with live editing built-in
in brackets you press a button that will
launch a new instance of your browser
with your updates already live sublime
text doesn't have it built in but the de
cana plugin gets pretty close however it
supports CSS in SCSS live editing but
not HTML chrome devtools has a
relatively little-known feature called
workspaces that allows you to ditch the
editor all together and work directly in
the browser you can make changes to your
CSS right in the Styles panel and have
them persist the same goes for
JavaScript there's a link in the
instructors notes listing all the steps
you need to take to set up workspaces on
your computer the fundamental flaw with
live editing in your editor is that it
isn't aware of your build process so be
mindful of that browser sync allows us
to have live editing that is assisted by
our build tool improving upon the two
methods we showed you before for this to
work we can reuse something we've
already learned about and that's the
watch tasks that currently watches our
SAS for changes in compiles them into
CSS browser sync works by creating or
practicing a local web server which
serves and tracks your files for changes
best of all it's free open source and is
compatible with most node.js based build
tools including gulp so let's go ahead
and set it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
