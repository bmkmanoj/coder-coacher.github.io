of scaling an image in two dimensions
which basically means I have an image
here and I want to generate another
image and in this case this image is
twice as big again we have simple sort
of things here in terms of how when I
get X Prime and Y prime from X&amp;amp;Y now
let's think about what would be in the
matrix M basically the way I want to do
scaling would be is simple right I would
just multiply each component by a fixed
scalar and uniform scaling would
basically be when the same scalars
applied to both X and Y's the difference
of course is if they're not the same you
would get a different aspect ratio so
let's say if I multiply the all of the
X's by one I would get the same width
but if I multiply all the Y's by two I
would get a different height so then
similarly you know that different aspect
ratios would come in so uniform scaling
would only be when I apply the same
constant both ways if I apply different
months in x and y directions that would
actually allow me to now have different
aspect ratios so what does that mean in
terms of our matrix here basically that
means is now we would replace the M
matrix by nothing else but two scalars
on the diagonal a which would actually
impact the scaling in the X direction
and B which would impact the scaling in
the Y direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
