counting chromosomes that are just
disorganized like this we know now that
there are 46 chromosomes in here
somewhere
but obviously trying to see which one is
which can be difficult so what we want
to do is what scientists do which is try
to find them and line them up in order
of biggest to smallest
and I'm actually going to give you a
little taste of that here and I'm
actually going to try to organize them
by literally cutting and pasting them
one by one okay so this was my very
amateur job at trying to organize these
chromosomes in order from biggest to
smallest you can see it there are some
imperfections here I probably didn't get
it right because this isn't my job this
isn't something I do on a regular basis
but let's take a look at how scientist
actually would put them in a row okay so
here's what it looks like if a
professional scientist who worked with
chromosomes and knows what they're doing
here if they cut and paste them and
organize them they'll get ordered in
this way so I want you to pay really
close attention to all the chromosomes
that you see here and see if there's any
kind of pattern that stands out to you
what I want you to tell me is if you see
any pattern that stands out and all of
these chromosomes when they're ordered
in this fashion from biggest to smallest
try to think of an answer one or
two-word response if possible and put it
in the text box here don't worry so much
about getting this question right or
wrong just try to look for any pattern
that you see and then put it in the text
box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
