my name is David Joyner and I'm thrilled
to bring you this course when we started
this program back in 2014 I would have
wondered if a course like this was
actually possible most of our online
courses are built around their lectures
and while conversations and discussions
do happen they usually aren't
foundational to the course but when this
course is taught on campus there are no
lectures it's all discussions
conversations activities project
presentations there's nothing really
that we can pre prepare and so I would
have wondered if a course like this
would translate to the online
environment and in fact that was one of
the main criticisms that some people had
of this program people said that you
can't have a real master's program
without a lot of interaction between
teachers and students but you can't have
that interaction online and so they
wondered if you we can actually have an
effective online master's program but
then we started to actually deliver our
courses and we found something
interesting not only could we have
discussions online that we're as good as
we have in-person but oftentimes they
were actually better the structure of
the online interface gave students a lot
of power to propose and guide their own
discussions and students respond to that
ownership by really making the classes
better so it's really because of y'all
that this class is here y'all showed us
that we could have a class like this in
an online program in this class we're
gonna try and push that envelope even
further we're going to try and build an
entire class around those kinds of
interactions and conversations and
discussions without any pre-prepared
lecture material we're going to build
the entire class around the project and
really try and build something that's a
useful contribution to the educational
technology field we're looking forward
to seeing what you come up with and
we're really excited to get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
