of Reddit I stored passwords in
clear-text because when I was writing
write it I didn't think anybody would
actually use it let alone a lot of
people so as we grew I had this little
bird in my ear telling me you know this
was bad you should fix this you should
hash these passwords I knew better but I
didn't because we actually got some
benefit out of clear text passwords when
spammers would come to Reddit they would
create thousands of counts but they
would use the same password for every
account so I was able to catch these
huge webs of spammers now the downside
of this is if somebody had stolen my
laptop I'd be in trouble and sure enough
somebody stole my laptop and it had all
of reddit's usernames and clear text
passwords on it and I got in a lot of
trouble over that now this would have
been an easy fix and it turns out you
know after that it wasn't easy fix we
just went through and hashed all the
passwords like we should have but it's
very important that you as a developer
take care of your users data because
they use the same password on lots of
sites they probably don't really know
better and you know it's easier for them
to be lazy than for you to be lazy
because you can solve it for everybody
so always hashed your passwords take
care of user stuff and you won't regret
it like I did once upon a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
