an hour or six fifths hours to complete
that work together and converting that
to minutes it would take them 72 minutes
total time to complete the work or one
hour and 12 minutes great work found
these two numbers we want to take our
equation and solve for x we know that
this fraction represents the amount of
work that they both can complete in one
hours time so X represents the amount of
time it takes for them to do all of that
work or to complete the entire job so we
can solve this equation by multiplying
through by the LCD which is 6x we simply
multiply these denominators together
since the greatest common factor among
them is one we simplify this to 3x this
2 to x and this fraction 26 we add like
terms on the left to get 5x equals 6 and
finally we divide both sides by 5 to get
x equals 6 fifth we know six fifths ours
is the same thing as 1 hour and
one-fifth of an hour and thinking all
the way back to fractions in our clock
we know when fifth of an hour is really
12 minutes now if you didn't know this
off the top of your head you could have
simply divided 60 minutes which is one
hour by five to get 12 minutes we know
an hour to 60 minutes so all together
this would make 72 minutes of time so
this is how we know that the two of you
can solve all the problems in 72 minutes
or six fifths hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
