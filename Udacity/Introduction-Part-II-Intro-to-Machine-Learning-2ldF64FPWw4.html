Valley at Google machine learning is all
over Silicon Valley here at Google
they're using machine learning for
obviously for search for ranking the
little pages that you can see for speech
recognition for language translation and
of course for self-driving cars one of
my favorite examples is a little bit
more trivial than that but I think it's
really fun there's a company in Silicon
Valley that I actually tell it what
clothes I like and then it will figure
out what my tastes are and it'll sell me
new clothes so I don't ever have to go
shopping it's machine doing I look it is
a machine learning so how long did he
have to train it it's really good I
didn't have to train it that long Wow so
is it 10% oh that's it I think they're
probably there should be here we go so
machinery was today it's the day age of
big data here and there's no company
within a ten-mile radius that would use
big data including Udacity to optimize
its products so that's what we'll be
learning about in this class there's all
kinds of interesting examples here we
will go in great depth into a few
questions in this class but you should
always be thinking about interesting
problems that you'd like to solve and
how machine learning can help you out
there and look if you do a great job we
do our best to find your job here in
Silicon Valley</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
