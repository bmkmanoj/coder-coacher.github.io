ability to quickly and seamlessly add
your web app to their home screen making
it easy to launch and return to your app
the best part chrome handles most of the
heavy lifting for you prompting the user
to add your web app to their home screen
is a powerful feature before showing the
add to homescreen banner chrome looks
for several heuristics to ensure a great
user experience it needs to use service
workers to provide an offline experience
apps that are added to the home screen
should be fast and always available no
offline asaurus it needs to have a web
manifest file to define what to launch
and how to launch it and it needs to
have an engaged user currently that
means to navigations within at least
five minutes but that will change in the
future when these heuristics are met
chrome will show the add to homescreen
banner across the bottom of the page
we've set the bar high because it's
important when users see the add to
homescreen banner they know that the app
that they're going to be adding will be
reliable fast and engaging in some cases
you might want to defer or even cancel
the banner until a more convenient time
for example an e-commerce company might
want to defer it until the user is in a
checkout flow and they've completed the
transaction check the link in the
instructor notes for more details on how
you can add analytics to the prompt and
understand how users are responding to
the banner for testing you can disable
the engagement checks by enabling the
bypass app banner engagement checks in
chrome and restarting the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
