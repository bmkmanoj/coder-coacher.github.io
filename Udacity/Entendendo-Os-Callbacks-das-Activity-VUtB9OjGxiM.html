states in the activity lifecycle how do
you tell the system that you want to
know about certain transitions so for
example you probably only want to show
an animation on the screen if the user
is actively looking at your activity and
you want to stop that animation as soon
as the screen is not visible anymore
well similar to clique handling the
system will signal to you that a life
cycle transition is happening via a
method call back and each of the
transitions gets its own callback
so using these callbacks it gives you as
a developer an opportunity to intervene
and execute statements so things like
restoring or saving any data or even
cleaning up references that you no
longer need at the moments that you need
them so here I am in the numbers
activity and you may have noticed that
we've been writing the majority of our
code in the activities on create method
so this is a callback that the system
executes once it has created your
activity and thus by overriding the
method in your class definition you're
able to specify what you want to happen
during that stage also this is where we
inflate our layout XML resources obtain
references to the view that we want to
manipulate and initialize any other
crucial objects that our app relies on
to function now in the Android developer
documentation if we look at the activity
class it shows all the system callbacks
for the various states of activity
lifecycle so you can override any of
these methods within your activity class
if you want to execute some code when
the activity transitions into a
particular State</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
