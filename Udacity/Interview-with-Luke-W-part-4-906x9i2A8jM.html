my career I've used lots of different
things all the way from eye tracking to
usability to quantitative analysis but I
think the most important thing is to be
iterative and to be in a process of
learning the worst case scenario you can
get to is what I call the sort of
culture of delivery which is your whole
processes are aligned to one ship date
and we redesign checkout okay what's the
next project that we shipped that that's
done
all right that's a culture of delivery a
culture of learning is hey we're gonna
try this
oh let's see what we can learn before we
actually build it oh we started to build
it let's prototype and make it better
and better
hey we launched it what happened let's
measure we should tweak that let's keep
measuring let's keep learning when you
do that then you find all these
opportunities for optimization and for
insights that you wouldn't have if all
you're doing is getting to that launch
and then moving on to the next launch
after that so internally here I have a
number of different teams that look at
both sides of the equation we do rapid
iterative prototyping up front so we'll
build a little prototype will put users
through it and we'll learn do they
understand our intent can they actually
act on what we're trying to allow them
to do and then after launch we'll go and
track the metrics and sometimes with the
metrics you'll see oh that's weird
why is that going on and then the next
natural step is to actually go talk to
people there's a case study that Expedia
published a long time ago which was
fascinating to me because they had a
checkout flow standard thing right you
have booked the trip and you're going
through it and they had this optional
field called company right above billing
information and for whatever reason
people would enter their company and
then start putting in the address of
their company below company which kind
of makes sense right but what happened
is they would get these billing errors
because they put in a billing address
that is not the billing address of their
credit card instead it's their company
that they work for this was an optional
field so Expedia removed it and
instantly they got 12 million more in
profit a year overnight just from
dropping this one optional field and
until you actually see somebody go
through the flow how would you ever
guess why there's so many errors you
have to talk to a couple people
oh they think it's their company's
address that's why we're getting all
these building errors it's not like bad
credit cards or what have you so that
combination of the quantitative data hmm
lots of errors in billing addresses and
qualitative why let's talk to them
really lets you fix the product and make
it work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
