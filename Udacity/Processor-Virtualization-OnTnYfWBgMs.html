supported protection levels can be used
we can start explaining how
virtualization techniques can be
developed that achieved our goal to
efficiently at New native speeds allow
execution of virtual machines on top of
these basically identical virtual
platforms first gift instructions are
executed directly by the hardware that's
important thing to know the virtual
machine monitor does not interfere with
every single instruction that is issued
by the guest operating system or its
applications for that matter what this
means is that just like the OS doesn't
interfere on every single instruction
and memory access here the hypervisor
does not interpose itself on every
single operation and every single memory
access performed by the guest as long as
the guest operating system in its
applications operate within the
resources that were allocated to them by
the hypervisor then everything is safe
the instructions in those cases will
operate at hardware speeds and this will
lead to efficiency of the virtualization
solution whenever a privileged
instruction gets accessed then the
processor causes a trap and Control is
automatically switched to the most
privileged level so to the hypervisor at
this point the hypervisor can determine
whether the operation is to be allowed
or not if the operation is an illegal
operation and it shouldn't be allowed
then the hypervisor can perform some
action like to terminate the VM if the
operation is should be allowed however
it's illegal operation in that case
their hypervisor should perform their
necessary emulation so that the guest
operating system is under the impression
that it actually does have control over
the hardware so from the guest
perspective it should seem as if the
hardware did exactly what was expected
to do given the instruction in reality
however it was the hypervisor that
intervened that potentially executed
slightly different set of operations in
order to achieve that emulation this
trap and emulate mechanism
is a key method and wage virtualization
solutions rely in order to achieve
efficient CPU virtualization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
