machines and I think we learned quite a
bit here that's right at the end of
naive Bayes we started a list of all the
different things that we should be
thinking about when picking an algorithm
we've learned a lot about support vector
machines that now we can add on to that
list
yes they work really well in complicated
domains where there's a clear margin of
separation and they don't perform so
well in very large data sets because the
training time able to be cubic in the
size of the data set and also don't work
well with lots and lots of noise so in
the class of a overlapping you have to
count independence that's well a naive
Bayes classifier would be better so
again it comes back to the data set that
you have and the features that you have
available you have a really big data set
if you have lots and lots of features
SVM's right out of the box might be very
slow and they might be prone to
overfitting to some of the noise in your
data okay yeah so just test it out on
the testing set see how it performs and
then you're ready to go exactly so I
think we're ready to go on to the next
lesson awesome great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
