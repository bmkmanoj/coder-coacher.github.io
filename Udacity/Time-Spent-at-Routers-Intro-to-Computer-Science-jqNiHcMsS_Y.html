calculate the time the data spends at
routers on its trip between two points
and the tracer we're going to take is
between me here in Birmingham England
and mid Sweden University now because
I'm using Windows my trace route is tra
C ERT instead of the whole word trace
route which was what Dave used on the
Mac and also on Linux this trace route
goes doesn't go directly to Sweden it
actually goes via the Netherlands and
Denmark so there we have NL Netherlands
DK denmark SE sweden and finally it's at
mid sweden university and it takes about
75 milliseconds and we're going to use
that value trace route and remember that
that's the round-trip time from
Birmingham England two suns file in
sweden takes 75 milliseconds now in
order to do this calculation we're going
to no need to know the distance so the
one-way distance from Birmingham to
sun's well now this isn't a direct
distance it's a distance via the
Netherlands and Denmark just like the
traceroute talk and it's about two and a
half thousand kilometres what you're
also going to need to know is the speed
of light and that's what we take the
speed the data travels at in optical
fibre and that's about two thirds of
speed of light which is two hundred
thousand kilometers per second and
that's the speed that you're going to
need for the data between the routers so
what I would like to know is what is the
total time
vent at the writers and if you'd like to
enter your data your answer sorry in the
box here one more thing you might need
to know is that there are a thousand
milliseconds in one second and please
make sure that your answer is given in
milliseconds and you can give it to the
nearest whole number or any number of
decimal places that you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
