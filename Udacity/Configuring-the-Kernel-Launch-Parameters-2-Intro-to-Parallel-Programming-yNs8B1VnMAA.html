can do looks like this square of three
parameters the first is the
dimensionality of the grid of blocks
that has be x times B Y times BZ blocks
each one of those blocks is specified by
this parameter the block of threads that
has t x times t y times TZ threads in it
and recall that this has a maximum size
finally there's a third argument the
defaults to 0 if you don't use it and
we're not going to cover it specifically
today it's the amount of shared memory
in bytes allocated per thread block so
with this one kernel call you can launch
an enormous number of threads let's all
remember with great power comes great
responsibility
so launch your kernels wisely one more
important thing about blocks and threads
recall from our square kernel that each
thread knows its thread idea within a
block it actually knows many things
first is threaded X as we've seen which
thread it is within the block so here we
have a block each thread say this thread
here knows its index in each of the x y
and z dimensions and we can access those
as thread at xx threaded x dot y and dot
Z we also know blocked in the size of a
block so how many threads are there in
this block along the x dimension the Y
dimension and potentially the Z
dimension and so we know those two
things for a block we know the analogous
things for a grid so block index for
instance is which block mi n within the
grid again XY and Z and grid them will
tell us the size of the grid how many
blocks there are in the x dimension the
Y dimension and the Z dimension what I
want you to take home from this little
discussion is only the following it's
convenient to have multi-dimensional
grids and blocks when your problem has
multiple dimensions CUDA implements this
natively and efficiently when you call
threaded xx or blocked my that's a very
efficient thing within CUDA since we're
doing image processing in this course
you should be counting on defining a lot
of 2 dimensional grids and blocks so
let's wrap up with a little quiz let's
say I launch the following kernel kernel
with two parameters dim 3/8 comma 4
comma 2 and M 3 16 comma
sixteen how many blocks will this call
launch how many threads per block and
how many total threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
