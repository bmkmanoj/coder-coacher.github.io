we boiled it down to another almost like
another recursive kind of another
iteration into our kind of induction now
we have another situation in which we're
dealing with two more kind of contiguous
at this point that because we've pasted
them together and we're asking to see
the same question okay so it is another
well-founded induction because we shrunk
the lengths of the things that we're
comparing recursively in in logic this
would look like X is the value at
position 1 of X does not equal the value
in position one and why that's our
condition here and there what we had
before about the position X so there
exists a j j is greater than 1 j is less
than the length of Y where X of 1 equals
y of J and it must be the case that
there's a permutation between the tail
of X leaving out the first element and
the results of pasting together why from
one up to j minus one with the result
with the third segment which was from j
plus 1 through the end of end of y and
the little funny symbol with looks like
a cap here is pasting together and the
real name for that is concatenation we
can concatenate two vectors together
using this operator and if those
conditions all hold then we'll then what
we're defining X in fact to be a
permutation of why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
