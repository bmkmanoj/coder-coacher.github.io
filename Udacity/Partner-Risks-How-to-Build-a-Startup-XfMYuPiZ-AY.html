wonderful boy what could go wrong with
us let's take a look at partnership
risks now everybody talks about all the
great things that happen partnerships
and large companies partner all the time
let me start with the large company
partnership risks one of the greatest
partnership disasters probably ever not
only in the twenty-first century
probably including the 20th was when
Boeing was building the 787 their new
jet airplane made out of carbon fiber
and not only was it a unique technology
advanced but at the same time they
decided to do something that no other
airline manufacturer had ever done what
they decided to do was instead of Boeing
now building all the parts they were
gonna outsource all the manufacturing
risk to a series of partners spread
around the world and while Boeing's
unions and and and machinist argued no
no there was 50 years of expertise on
how to build these components Boeing
because of other pressures both
financial and Union decided that it
would be a much smarter strategic move
to have people building the center
fuselage in Italy and the tail fin
somewhere else and the stabilizers
somewhere else in them forward fuselage
by another vendor until all of a sudden
their supply chain was scattered around
the world and at least half these parts
being made by people who've never made
airplane components it looked great on
paper it was gonna save them enormous
manufacturing costs it turned out to be
the worst business decision of the 21st
century because it was made by
accountants and not by engineers turns
out their partners delayed the program
by about three or four years because
there was a tremendous amount of rework
parts didn't fit parts didn't work and
this wasn't your living room furniture
these weren't devices that were gonna
carry hundreds of people in the air and
there was no margin for error
turns out Boeing actually had a go
buyback a good number of these
manufacturers and bring back their
expertise and oversight which they
assumed wouldn't be necessary so I just
used this as an example not to bash
Boeing but to understand that even the
smartest companies sometimes make
partnership decisions that
look good on a spreadsheet but at the
end of the day partnerships are not
driven by spreadsheets they're driven by
technical competence customer needs and
the ability to deliver a final finished
quality product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
