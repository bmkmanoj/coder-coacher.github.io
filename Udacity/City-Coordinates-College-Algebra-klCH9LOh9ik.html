to the expo he's curious about how far
his plane is traveling though he's not
super familiar with the geography around
the city where the expo is it's called
something like you de City maybe it's
called Udacity hmm I don't know however
he does know that you dasa t is about
700 miles north of some other city that
he knows a bit more about and thats it
hes only 200 miles east of his town to
help him visualize the most efficient
path for the plane to take grant was a
draw a picture but a picture that's a
bit more exact than the silly 1i drawn
right here if we say that grants
hometown is looking at the origin on
some coordinate plane and we split our
coordinate plane up into chunks of
square miles which are the coordinates
of Udacity be and the coordinates of the
other city be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
