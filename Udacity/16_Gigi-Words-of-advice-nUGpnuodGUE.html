I wanted entrepreneurs it's a great
question because at the end of the day
and intrapreneur is filled of
contradictions and and when I the people
that are really those there's great
great entrepreneur that I'm looking for
they're very strange people because
let's take a few of these contradictions
to start with these are people that are
you know what we go alpha dogs they run
they stop they break for no one they
know what to do at any given point on
the other hand they're never that good
if they can't take advice but it's
pretty much in contradiction because
these people that just run forward
they're usually not the one to take
advice well great entrepreneurs are when
you look at it there preneur they're
people that are very smart so they
understand that the chances of a
start-up to succeed are roughly one out
of 20 because that's the statistics on
the other hand the great ones never
believe that they're going to be the
ones failing they know that they're
going to be on succeeding again they're
creating their own reality and the third
thing is that these entrepreneurs are
they wake up in the morning and they
know one hundred percent that they're
going in the right direction by the
afternoon they can pivot the company
because they rented to a new piece of
data that force them to change their
view but they will wake up the next
morning again being one hundred percent
sure that they're running in the right
direction which is a totally different
direction than yesterday and so these
qualities are basically the main quality
that i look in entrepreneurs when i find
the ones that are like that these are
the one hour meetings right these are
the one hour meetings went after that i
say hey you know that's a perfect
personality fit to be an entrepreneur I
don't care what your field you know you
may pivot row like here 20 times but I
want to be part of that journey because
that's a person that that's going to
succeed that's an entrepreneur that has
every everything it takes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
