customers for the web mobile channels
now if you remember we started here on
the Left we didn't earn than paid media
we got customers acquired them and
activated them we've kept them trying to
keep churn to a minimum and now we're
going to grow customers with a series of
activities just like in the physical
channel
can we upsell can we next sell can we
cross sell one can get referrals that
will get us a viral group one of the
most important metrics to think about
now that we have an end-to-end funnel is
something called lifetime value and a
lifetime value LTV is not your lifetime
put your customer's lifetime how much
will they spend with you and your
company from the beginning to the very
end and this is kind of an interesting
idea because most startups and most
founders are focused on how do I get
them to activate here but for you to be
a successful company and actually
thinking about how much you could spend
on them over here you need to understand
can I get them to spend more and more
over time and how to keep them longer
and longer by reducing churn so one of
the interesting equations for every
startup is that lifetime value needs to
be greater than customer acquisition
cost seems intuitively obvious but what
you want to make sure is the amount of
money you're collecting over here is
bigger than the customer acquisition
cost you remember the amount of money
you're spending from here to here that
was the customer acquisition cost CAC
here so lifetime value needs to be
greater than customer acquisition cost
and as you get more familiar with your
company and start talking to investors
the real interesting thing is what is
this ratio for example in SAS software
some investors think that numbers should
be three to one in telecom it might be
something else but the key idea is you
are now not just focused on the initial
purchase but you're focused on the
lifetime value if you have the world's
most perfect business model investors
would love to see this number much
bigger than this number and so what you
want
they look for is a well-balanced model
that takes into account how much you
need to acquire customers but how much
ultimately you will extract from them
over the lifetime what's the lifetime
that really is up to you and your
investors and how many years you
calculate lifetime value some use three
years some use five that's a question
that you and your investors will discuss
this acquisition cost versus the
lifetime value discussion really is a
balancing act so what are some of the
balancing acts well in the customer
acquisition cost if all of a sudden you
could get a viral loop going well that
decreases your cost of acquisition if in
fact your conversion rate between
acquisition activation could be
increased again it decreases your
customer acquisition cost if you could
do in physical channels telesales or
inside sales versus having a direct
sales force again your CAC declines the
idea is what can you do to make this
very efficient and therefore also on the
lifetime value how do you reduce churn
and attrition and keeping customers do
you have scalable pricing are you
cross-selling and upselling a lot can
you expand your product line and again
are you getting a viral loop and
referral loop from happy and satisfied
customers telling others word-of-mouth
and so this is a balancing game and for
first-time entrepreneurs who are focused
here it's really important to think
about customer acquisition cost and
lifetime value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
