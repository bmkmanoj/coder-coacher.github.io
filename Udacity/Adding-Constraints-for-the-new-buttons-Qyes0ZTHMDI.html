recording label in stop button stay in
the correct position and size at all
times much like the original record
button we need to add constraints these
two interface elements first we have to
think about what we want which is three
UI elements one beneath the other
centered on screen they should always be
in the center regardless if we're
running the app on a small iPhone or the
new iPad pro we already have a recording
button centered on the main UI view of
our view controller so we can anchor the
other two views off the recording button
let's start with the recording label the
recording label is this one here that
says tap to record with it selected
let's control drag diagonally to the
record button the menu that comes up is
contact sensitive to the direction of
the drag if you just do a straight up
and down or left to right drag you only
get a subset of the constraint options
with the shift key held down select the
vertical spacing and centered
horizontally then click add constraints
this means that we want to maintain the
vertical spacing from the recording
button to this label and then we want
the label to be centered horizontally to
the record button so how does out a
layout know where the label needs to be
on screen it checks to see where the
record button is and place this label
based on that using the two constraints
that you've just set up if you're
remembering back to earlier how I
mentioned that there are two constraints
needed for each axis 2 for the x and 2
for the Y your correct
however the label much like the UI
button has an intrinsic size so auto
layout can figure out the height and
width of the label based on the text and
font of the label so all we need to
provide is where to place it along the X
and y axis in other words just one
constraint for the X and one constraint
for the Y let's set up the constraints
of the stop recording button against the
tab to record label once more drag the
agony from the stop recording button to
the tap to record label with the shift
key pressed down select vertical spacing
and center horizontally then click add
constraints we should be able to see six
constraints under the constraints
section of the
document outline your number here inside
these constraints may vary a little bit
from 20 to 21 to 23 and they may be a
little different in mine and that's okay
they're based on where you placed your
UI elements in the storyboards when you
drag them in let's see if this worked
click run or press command R and you
should see the pitch-perfect app running
on the iOS simulator let's try a
different screen orientations to see if
they stay centered we can see here that
they stay centered at the landscape and
we'd see the same if we switch to
different iOS simulators such as the
iPad air we should see here there are
three buttons are always centered on
screen remember it may seem frustrating
now but that's okay you're just learning
and this is likely one of the first
times you've tried Auto layout keep at
it and they'll become second nature in
no time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
