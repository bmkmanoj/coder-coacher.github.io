branding and marks it gives you the
right to prevent others from using
confusingly similar mat marks and logos
it lasts as long as you use the mark the
more you use it the stronger your
protection and there are country by
country loss that kind of define
trademark and it's optional to register
it but it has significant advantages if
it's approved copyright and just gives
you the right to prevent others from
copying or distributing or making
derivatives of your work and you could
copyright more than just technology it's
what we do for songs books movies etc it
lasts practically forever but doesn't
prevent independent development someone
else could do something independently
and come up with something quite similar
you could register it is optional but
it's required to sue for infringement
and sometimes you see copyright labelled
on the bottom of something with a little
C with a circle that means somebody is
claiming that this is their original
work and suggesting that you need their
license or permission to make a copy
trade secrets as we talked about you
want to keep that secret and it has an
economic value no registration is
required it's basically how safe do you
think your idea is going to be inside
your company protected with armed guards
and a vault it can last for as long as
you take reasonable steps contracts
again it's everything that's in the
contract no registration process you
have what her protection is defined in
the contract now patents are interesting
a patent is a government is giving you a
monopoly by preventing others from
making using or selling your invention
even if the others infringement was
innocent or accidental and this has to
be a non-obvious invention it has to
last over the protection lasts for about
fifteen to twenty years and there's a
whole application and examination
process and it's worth you getting up to
date and understanding about patents
early on very rough rule of thumb is if
you're in web - oh you probably
shouldn't be spending a lot of time on
patents though there are exceptions if
you're in life sciences and the other
extreme you shouldn't leave your bedroom
without a patent counsel walking you out
there are some rules of thumb for each
industry and each market and you really
need to spend at least an hour before
you
start your company understanding what
rules apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
