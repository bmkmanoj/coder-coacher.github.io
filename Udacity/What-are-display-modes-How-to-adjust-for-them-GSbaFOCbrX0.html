modes interactive and ambient your watch
face design should take these modes into
account when the user moves their wrists
to glance at their watch or if the user
touches it the screen goes into
interactive mode your design can use
full color with fluid animation along
with the background image or gradient in
this mode and you can press the side
button to go back into ambient mode or
it'll timeout by itself ambient mode
helps the device conserve power your
watch face design needs to include a
separate design for ambient mode how
similar or different it is is up to you
your watch face can use some color such
as that red there on screens that
support it as long as it's still obvious
that the device is in ambient mode in
this mode the screen is only updated
once every minute so you should not show
the second hands that we saw moving
around earlier your watch face will
spend most of its time in ambient mode
see should thoughtfully designed for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
