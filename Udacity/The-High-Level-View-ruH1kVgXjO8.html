outlining the outline of the lesson is
just a short document that gives a
high-level sequence of a lesson and if
you know how to use Google Docs you know
how to write an outline but writing a
good outline is more difficult and this
lesson is really about choosing the
right sequence of steps to achieve your
learning objective for this lesson that
sequence will be we're going to start
with a preparatory activity meant to get
you thinking about what makes things
easy or hard next you'll do a brief
reading on what's called cognitive load
theory will you learn how educators
think about difficulty after that you'll
do an exercise where you use this
cognitive load theory to actually
analyze the strengths and weaknesses in
a segment of a Udacity lesson next we'll
go even deeper into some educational
lingo as you do some reading on
information processing theory which will
give you some insight into how the brain
processes and encodes new information
next you'll actually apply information
processing theory by fixing some of the
weaknesses you identified in the Udacity
lesson in step 3 then you'll use these
two new theories cognitive load theory
and information processing theory to
deconstruct your own expertise for the
learning objective you chose in the
previous lesson finally you'll actually
create an outline which will be a
sequence of five to ten steps that will
actually let your learner go from novice
towards the expertise you articulated in
your learning objective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
