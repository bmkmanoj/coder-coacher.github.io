organizational concepts and the
relationship of concepts with each other
we already come across this when we were
talking about background knowledge in
the previous lesson on incremental
concept learning so we had a break and a
wedge they were both subclasses of a
block in general the organizational
concepts can be much more complex so
here is a set of concepts that you're
probably all familiar with we have
different kind of animals water breaks
in vertebrates whatever is themselves
can be of different kinds reptiles birds
mammals and so on and here are birds
which can be of different kinds eCos
bluebirds and penguins like we saw in
the previous slide in general the
organization of these concepts can be a
little bit more complicated so this is a
conceptual hierarchy that I expect all
of your family with the animals of
weirdest kinds water Brits and
invertebrates for example and water base
themselves can be or different kind
reptiles birds mammals and birds can be
of different kinds for example egos
bluebirds and penguins so these are
classes and these are subclasses and
super classes now the advantage of this
kind of conceptual organization is that
I can start going in a top-down way
establishing and refining each category
so you see an animal and you're trying
to decide whether it animal is a blue
bird or eagle or a penguin and you may
start initially by saying well is it a
water break then is it a bird and if it
is a bird then is it an eagle a bluebird
or penguin when you and I do processing
of this kind it might happen so fast if
we might not be aware of it but when we
are trying to build an air agent we have
to make that processing very very
explicit even among humans imagine for
example what happens when the scientist
discovers a new kind of species then the
scientists begin from the top and say
well is it a water bridge should I wait
exactly should industry should I put
this species is it a bird is it closer
to eagle should I put it closer to a
bluebird and so on so classification of
this kind often has a top-down
established refine establish refine
connected to it so one of the benefits
of this established and refined approach
is it helps us figure out which
variables we need to actually key in on
and focus on so for example we saw
earlier that Eagles are large but
bluebirds are small so birds can come in
different sizes so if we're trying to
establish whether something is a bird a
reptile or a mammal
we know that mammals also come in
different sizes like tiny mice or large
elephants so size does it really impact
our decision whether it's a reptile bird
or mammal but once we've established
it's a bird and we're trying to decide
between eagle and Bluebird for example
we know that size actually can be
something that helps us differentiate
between these two so now we'll pay
attention to size as a variable that
matters so note that there's several
things going on here on one side it is
knowledge of these different classes but
there's also organization of these
different classes in a hierarchy of a
particular kind this organization is
very powerful in some ways if knowledge
is power so is organization organization
two is power this organization provides
power because this organization tells
you what the controller processing
should be establish one node refine it
established at node refine it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
