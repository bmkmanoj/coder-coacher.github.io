increase the length of the shortest
augmenting path by at least two we are
now ready to bound the number of phases
specifically the number of phases used
by Hopcroft carp is ordered square root
of V note that the trivial bound saying
that there can be only one phase /
possible augmenting path length isn't
good enough that would still leave us
with an order V bound in reality we will
have a phase for length 1 for length 3
probably for length 5 maybe not for
length 7 and so forth but as we consider
greater and greater possible phase
lengths the ones for which we will
actually have augmenting phases gets
sparser and sparser the key argument
will be that after roughly square root
of v phases the path length will be at
least square root of v and that then
will imply that we only have square root
of v phases left to fill out the
argument will let m prime be the
matching found by hopcroft carp and will
let em be the matching after the ceiling
of the square root of v phases because
each phase increase the shortest
augmenting path by to the length of the
shortest augmenting path in m is at
least twice the square root of v plus 1
and hence no path in the symmetric
difference between m and M prime that is
augmenting 4m can have shorter length
this implies that there are most the
size of V divided by this shortest path
length augmenting paths for em in the
symmetric difference here we just run
out of vertices there aren't enough left
to fill out any more paths than this
then if there can be only so many
augmenting paths in the difference then
M can't be too far away from M Prime
certainly at most the square root of V
hence m will only be augmented square
root of V more times meaning that there
can't be more than the square root of V
more phases we have square root of V
phases to make all the augmenting paths
long enough so that there can be only
square root of V possible more
augmentations and that completes it
there overall them we've just shown that
hopcroft carp finds a maximum
matching in time order e times the
square root of V we only had square root
of the phases and each phase because of
the clever way we were able to reuse the
level graph only ends up using order e
time and this result is actually the
best known</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
