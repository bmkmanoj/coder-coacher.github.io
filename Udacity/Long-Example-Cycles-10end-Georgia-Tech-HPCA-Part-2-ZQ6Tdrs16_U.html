instruction will be able to dispatch
this is our ad and it's gonna execute in
cycles 10 and 11 so in cycle 12 is going
to try to write its result so in cycle
11 nothing really happens
other than the execution of these two
instructions but in cycle 12 what's
going to happen is this instruction is
going to broadcast this result so we
will mark that in broadcast the result
we will find the register that matches a
t2 which is f6 and overwrite the value
of f6
with the new value which is the minus
nine point six plus minus two point five
so it's gonna be minus twelve point one
so this is the value of 82 and now we're
gonna earn rename this to make future
accesses read the new f6 and no
instructions was waiting for note that
this was the last instruction in our
sequence so nobody was really waiting
for this result but this instruction is
done now so we can free this reservation
station now nothing will really happen
until cycle 17 in cycle 17 this multiply
is finally gonna broadcast its result
we're multiplying two point five times
two point five and then you know - and
that value goes into F 0 so f 0 is gonna
become whatever that result is we're not
gonna even try to compute that it's
gonna be unrelated here it's gonna put
that value over here and now the divide
is finally ready to go and we're gonna
free this reservation station so finally
in cycle 18 the divide is ready to go
it's been dispatched add 40 cycles so
it's gonna be in cycle 58 that we
finally produce that result so nothing
really happens until cycle 58 at which
point this value is broadcast register
f10 gets to grab that value we aren't
renamed this we free this reservation
station we look at who is waiting for it
but nobody is and that concludes our
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
