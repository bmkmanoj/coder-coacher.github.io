hand however there's a huge variety of
phenomena that are governed by the laws
of physics for simple tasks such as a
bouncing ball keyframing can suffice
here's a key framing timeline 3d studio
max in the process of setting up an
animation like this what if we wanted to
have the bouncing ball keep bouncing key
framing by hand becomes a challenge
since there's no simple repetition for
these phenomenon we turn to simulation
to generate the animations here's
another example a set of bodies
attracted to each other by gravitational
forces for the bouncing ball we could
have perhaps written a little program
that would create the keyframes for us
here the motions are complex in are
calculated frame to frame on the fly
many other phenomena can be simulated in
real time here's an example of a spring
system these three demos were all
created in glow script a system that's
even higher level than 3gs simulating
friction is an area that can be
challenging but critical if you want to
get anywhere a blowing wind has drag and
lift constraints cloth has stretch
constraints this is a relatively simple
system that can be solved in real time
as you can see simulations can be
affected by the users actions as a
simple example in this demo you can turn
the wind on and off at a ball and so on
these are not simply pre-stored canned
animations but our interactive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
