very simple to do exactly this here's
our list from the example and we want to
know where 84 will fall what position 84
will be in in the sorted list all we
need to do is count we start off with
this possible variable set to 0 we loop
through all the values in the list and
for each one we say well is it smaller
than the value we're asking about if so
we increment the position sort of bumps
it one space to the right in the sorted
list and then when we're done we just
return that position so in this list 84
will be in position 10 so we're going to
use this idea now to to do something a
little more clever so let's imagine
we've got some list and has some value V
in it we know now how we can actually
figure out where V will go in a sorted
list let's actually put it there let's
actually put that value in the list at
that position Jenna 12 will generate a
new list l prime and we're going to put
in that list it's going to be a
permutation of these values we're going
to shuffle around these values but we're
going to put V in its final resting
place as it were the final sorted
position and make sure that to its left
are all things less than V and to it's
right or all things greater than V and
apart from that we don't care what the
order inside is so it's kind of a
partially sorted list and we call this
partitioning around V so what I'd like
you to do is write is modify the Python
code that we're just looking at to take
a list L and a value V and return a new
list l prime that has the property that
v is in its final sword place everything
to the left of it is to the left of it
and everything to the right of it is to
the right of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
