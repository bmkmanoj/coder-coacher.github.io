actually measure the center surrounded
pneus of a ganglion cell while it's
working okay I wouldn't recommend doing
this to you or to anybody else you have
any care for whatsoever but basically
the way you do recordings is here's a
schematic of a neuron so it has
dendrites we're here they receive inputs
from the synapses and when the inputs
are correct it will generate a spike of
firing down here and then these
terminals impact the next nerves that
it's in contact with and if you were to
put an electrode right over here you
would occasionally see these spikes and
neural coding we tend to refer to as the
more spikes per second is a higher level
so we've gone essentially from analog to
digital right in an analog system the
amount of the voltage tells you how high
it is or how low it is in a digital
system there's something discreet that
tells us okay you know there's 15 ones
and two zeros that's a higher number
than all zeros or etc well in the in the
neural system the way we do is we look
at how how often is the neuron firing
and you can actually go ahead and do
this this is a picture of a micropipette
an electrode getting ready to record
from a neuron so you do these with
neurons that are still living right this
is why I said you wouldn't want to do
this to anybody you cared for all right
and what you can do is you can then put
different kinds of stimuli at different
locations in the eye and see what
happens all right and if you do that you
can find areas so here we have when it's
just black this neuron doesn't do things
very much okay but when it's white in
the middle okay and black out here all
right and what this is all by the way
this is time going this way so this is
when the the spot was turned on you can
see when it goes from the back row this
is called the background activity when
it goes from the background when it
turns on this thing starts firing crazy
and then you turn it off and it stops
again okay fine but what's then cool is
if I then turn on
a really bright spot okay nothing
happens it stays just like my background
and in fact if I want to turn the cell
off even more i turn on just the outside
and I make the middle black and hear
what you can see is it actually just
shut down the background all together
and then when it turn the thing off it
wakes back up again and then returns
back to its normal so this is a non cell
okay that is its center is positive
exact opposite cell here is negative
okay and both are found in the in the
retina the other thing that's found in
the retina are ganglion cells whose size
in terms of their response is different
so there are ones for very small for
medium and larger and your system is
actually tuned to have more of a
particular size and that tuning is what
gives you this phenomena so again this
is going to be a function of how your
monitor is calibrated all right but the
contrast sensitivity function so for me
so what this is is this is a sinusoid
where the frequency gets goes up this
way and contrast goes up as you get
further down alright and the question is
where can you see the bars and for me I
can see the bar is kind of like like
that okay so the question is why can't I
see this stuff here but I can see this
stuff there for the same level of
contrast the answer is my retina has
more and a better tuned receptors at
this size frequency then at this size
frequency this phenomenon that you're
seeing is a function of what goes on
inside your eyeball and that can be
graphed out looking like this two things
interesting about this graph first is
this is a function of frequency and here
they use different luminance levels so
they make it brighter and brighter and
it's sort of how sensitive you are and
then something and for the PETA folks
amongst you please ignore this you'll
notice that the human data and the
macaque macaque is a type of monkey
are very very similar now this is done
of course without doing anything to
anybody right you just ask them what do
you see etc but what this data show is
that the vision system the retinal
vision system of the macaque monkey is
really quite similar to the human so if
you were to do experiments on primates
measuring physiological things remember
those electrodes we have reasonably that
we learn there is the same would apply
also to the human system so when you
have psychophysical experiments like
this it shows you the similarity between
human and macaque</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
