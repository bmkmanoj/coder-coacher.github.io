actually where a lot of the magic
happens with d3 this first block binds
our data to our SVG elements now this is
one of the most confusing parts of d3
for newcomers to the library we first
access the SVG chart element find every
possible group tag they may be in there
and the group tag can be thought of as
analogous to the div tag in HTML it has
no visual display but serves to group
and organize content that may be
contained within it we then bind data
passing in the data there our draw
function receives to the dot data
function which binds it to the group's
dot enter actually returns a sub
selection of the call to dot data which
represents every datum that has not
already been placed on the page in this
case in the first call to dot data there
are no elements on the page which have
bounded to them so da enter actually
contains one element for every point in
our data dot app ng instructs the
browser that for every point in the
enter selection append a G element to
the chart and then for each of those
group elements we want to transform them
according to this function now there's a
lot going on there I want to unpack it a
little bit though we'll get much more
into the details of what's happening
with dot data and enter in later lessons
and also learn about other types of
selections that aren't necessarily dot
enter from a very high level this code
basically says look into my SVG find
whatever G tags there are there if there
are 0 G tags the select all will be an
empty selection attach data to our
selection and dot enter basically says
for every point that's in our data which
doesn't have a corresponding element in
the initial selection in this case since
our initial selection was empty because
there weren't any G tags yet dot enter
again contains
element for every point in our data
dependence trucks d3 and for every one
of these new group elements change the
transform attribute which is unique to
SVG according to whatever gets returned
from this function again if that wasn't
perfectly clear we'll get more into
those details and specifics and later
lessons I just want to show you what it
looks like and how to create a
data-driven chart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
