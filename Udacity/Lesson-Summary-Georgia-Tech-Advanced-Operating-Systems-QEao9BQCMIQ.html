discussing the model of a parallel
machine and in this lesson what we're
going to start doing is talking about
synchronization algorithms that goes
into the guts of any parallel operating
systems that are supporting
multi-threaded applications and as we
discuss these synchronization algorithms
watch out for attackers code that I
mentioned in the previous lesson on
sharing in shared memory multiprocessors
that is going to be very very key in
terms of understanding the scalability
of the synchronization algorithms
synchronization primitives are a key for
parallel programming in your first
project you implemented a threads
library which provides the mutual
exclusion lock let's talk about locks
what exactly is a lock well you know in
the metaphor that you know about in real
life lock is something that protects
something that is precious and in the
context of parallel programming if you
have multiple threads executing and they
share some data structure it is
important that the threads don't mess up
each other's work and a lock is
something that allows a thread to make
sure that when it is accessing some
particular piece of shared data it is
not in to being being interfered with by
some other thread that's the purpose of
a lock so the idea would be that a
thread would acquire a lock and once it
acquires the lock it knows that it can
access this data that it shares with
potentially other threads I'm showing
only two threads here but potentially in
a multi-threaded program you can have
lot more threads that are sharing a data
structure and once t1 knows that it has
access to this data structure then it
can do whatever it wants with it and
then once it is done with whatever it
wants to do with this data it can
release the lock so that's sort of the
idea behind a lock and locks come in two
flavors one is what we'll call an
exclusive lock or a mutual exclusion
lock and this is exactly the one that
you implemented in your first project
and the idea is as the name suggests
actually exclusive lot means that it can
be used by at one thread at a time
that's the idea and here's a silly
example of two children playing and you
know they had to take turns in order to
hit this ball and obviously you don't
want both of them hitting the ball at
the same time not good for the game and
not good for the safety of the children
either that's in the same thing that
applies to the mutual exclusion lock
that we use in parallel programming the
idea is that a thread that wants to
modify data it has to make sure that
when it is modifying the data nobody
else is going to be accessing that
particular data structure and therefore
it is going to get a mutual exclusion
lock it knows that nobody else is going
to be messing with it then it can modify
the data and then release a lock and
similarly if another thread wants to
read the data and once the assurance
that nobody is going to be modifying
this data while it is reading it it can
get an exclusive lock access the data
read it and then release it that's the
idea behind mutually exclusive lock you
can also have a shared lock now what
that means is that this lock is
something that allows multiple threads
to access the data at the same time well
under what conditions would that be
meaningful well here is a an analogy
again if there's a newspaper and
multiple people want to read the
newspaper at the same time perfectly
fine to do that right that's the same
sort of thing that happens often in
parallel programming that you have a
database and and there are records in
the database that multiple threads want
to inspect but they want to make sure
that while they're inspecting it the
data itself is not going to be changed
so a shared lock is something that
allows multiple readers to access some
data with the assurance that nobody else
is going to be modifying the data so
these are two different types of locks
that you might have that might be useful
in developing multi-threaded shared
memory programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
