precisely measure each type of
variability we already decided that
we're going to use the ground mean and
use the same idea as standard deviation
to measure the spread of these sample
means we'll find each square deviation
from the mean and in this case we're
going to multiply each squared deviation
by the sample size each squared
deviation is equivalent to the area of
each of these squares and then we'll
multiply this area by the respective
sample size here K represents the number
of samples that means we'll have K
sample means and then we'll add them all
up in this lesson though we're assuming
that all samples have the same size so
we can get rid of the K and it's just a
constant across all samples that means
that we can write the numerator between
group variability like this and then we
divide by the degrees of freedom when we
say formal way of measuring something
that means we get one number if we add
up each square deviation of each sample
mean from the ground mean multiply this
by the sample size and then divide by
the degrees of freedom we get one number
that describes between group variability
we need to do the same for within group
variability and we'll do something
similar to the way we measured between
group variability we'll take the sum of
squares for each individual sample from
the mean of each sample and then we
divide by the degrees of freedom what do
you think the degrees of freedom is in
this case let's say that we have three
samples more than one option may be
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
