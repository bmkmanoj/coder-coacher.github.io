chen hun and i'm your TA for the class
today i will be walking you through
problem set number one and for problem
set number one our goal is to cover an
image from color to black and white so
to convert a image from color to black
and white when first have to understand
how color digital images are represented
the most common format is to specify how
much red green and blue is presented at
each pixel each color is quote a channel
0 means that color is fully absent or as
255 means that color is fully saturated
therefore if at a pixel all three
channels red green and blue are zero
means that pixel is black like such or
if all three channels red green and blue
are 255 that pixel is fully white just
like the background of the slide so how
are pixels represented in CUDA so in
CUDA code each pixel is represented as a
unsigned char for struct this structure
has four unsigned char components named
X Y Z and W X is your red channel Y is
your green Channel Z is your blue
Channel and W is your alpha Channel the
fourth component char W here is reserved
for the Alpha Channel which carries the
transparency information we will ignore
this component through our homework as
this does not pertain to transforming
that image from color to greyscale so
how do we convert a color image to a
black and white image so one possibility
was simply to take the average of all
the three colour channels so for example
at r2 G to be the channels R stands for
red G stands for green and B stands for
blue and simply divide by three but it
turns out that our I've stone respond to
all colors the
equally we're more sensitive to the
color green than red and more sensitive
to the color red than the color blue so
taking into account our varying
sensitivities to the different color
channels we are going to use this
following formula instead so we are
going to multiply the color channel red
by 0.2 99 we are going to multiply the
color channel green by 0.5 a 7 and we
are going to multiply the color channel
blue by 0.1 1/4 so let's look at problem
set number 1 and let's look at the code
that you will actually have to write for
this assignment so for problem set
number 1 you have two drops that you
have to do so for the first part your
job is to fill in this RGB a to
grayscale function we will pass you in
an array of you chart for which
represents the pixel in the color image
and your job is to convert each pixel in
this 2d array into an intensity value
that you will write back to this 1d
array Co great image and you will follow
the formula that we talked about in the
previous slide as seen here in part to
the kernels already filled in for you
but with incorrect dimensions and
Spotty's empty so your job for part two
is to fill in the body of the kernel and
to correct the dimension of block size
and grid size we have included reference
code that performs the same calculation
in Syria on the CPU for your reference
and if you have any questions or if you
run into any problems feel free to post
on the forums and I'll be there to help
you so lastly I would like to thank Eric
Olson of royal caliber and Mike Roberts
for their fantastic job with writing the
homeworks they have also written the
script this video today as well so thank
you Eric and Mike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
