with B R and P I'll show you right now
let's uh let's make this all be one line
again okay so I update this and we have
one line if we can put a br tag in the
middle of this we don't actually have to
have the line breaks in our HTML so when
I click update we get our line break no
matter how the HTML is formatted so we
can format this however we want put all
of these spaces in here and when we
update this it'll always come out the
same there's an example all this white
space turns into turns into one single
space all of these new lines here turn
into one single space you know this text
space is really yeah you get the idea
okay why do we have two different ways
of making new lines why do we have a br
tag and a P tag the answer is because
the br tag is what we call in line and
the P tag is what we call block now so
what the br tag was actually doing was
just ending a line so when we have some
text and we put a br in the middle of it
it just basically says the line ends
here and this guy wraps to the next line
the P tag works differently the P tag
actually makes an invisible box so when
we have HTML looks like this this
creates an actual box so instead of this
rendering text blank line what this is
actually rendering is something sort of
like this you've got two lines of text
and there's actually this invisible box
around text and that's what the P tag
does is it makes this invisible box and
this invisible box can actually have
height and it can have with where inline
elements are just text so it the example
over here would be more like this so
it's just two lines of text and there's
really just a little new line here
there's nothing nothing fancy going on
and the difference between inline and
block elements will come up a fair
amount later in this course and it's
just it's important to know that there's
a distinction and they have kind of a
different behavior so far all of the
elements we've learned other than P or
inline elements so inline elements are B
even image is an inline element and we
saw how before our little Hipmunk image
appeared right in the middle of the text
that's because it's inline and so far
the only black element we've learned is
the P element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
