we're going to build a little web
application that uses cookies to keep
track of how many times you visited a
website and I'll show you you know how
to use cookies in App Engine and some
some things we need to keep in keep in
mind so this is the kind of template
I've been working from for App Engine
stuff first thing I want to do is is
just set the content type to text so
we'd have to deal with HTML for right
now okay so I've added this line here
that gets a cookie called visits the way
this works is we look at the request
object which is always on self the
request object will have a a cookies
object which is a convenience thing that
App Engine did for us it parsed our HTTP
headers and it threw all of the cookies
into this dictionary like object and we
can call get on it which is you know
distinct from this get of course this is
a function we call in dictionaries to
check to see if a key is in the
dictionary and if it is we get the value
of that key and if it's not we get the
default which will set to zero what I
want to do is I want to print through
our user how many times we visited the
site okay so I added this line to just
write to the user you've been here
percent s times remember our string
substitution and we'll print visits
there so let's go ahead and give this a
test in our browser I've loaded my page
and it says I've been here zero times
and if I reload the page over and over
it still says zero times because we're
not doing any counting we're just
printing the number zero over and over
so let's go ahead and store how many
times we've been to the site in a cookie
so the way we do this first we're going
to take the visit no more visits we have
and we're going to increment it by one
visits plus equals one and then we're
going to store the number of visits in
this cookie called visits so the next
time we come back we'll get it the way
we set a cookie and App Engine is we
just set the set cookie header okay so I
added two more lines here visits plus
equals 1 which will increment the visits
counts that we got from a cookie and
then we're going to set the cookie so
the way we do that is on the response
object there's a headers object you know
just like when we set the content type
and now we want to run a call add header
we could treat it like a dictionary but
add header here is special because
remember you can have multiple headers
with the same name and so if you use the
dictionary syntax you'd overwrite the
the header so in this case we're gonna
use add header that's what we're going
to use for cookies here so we're gonna
use the setcookie header and I'm just
going to use I'm not going to worry
about domain and path right now that's
not what we're trying to experiment with
here and we're going to say visits
equals percent s and include our visits
parameter all right so let's see if that
works
we're in our browser and you know when I
and I've reloaded the page and so we see
I've been here one time and I reload the
page again oh and we see an error and
this makes sense need a string int found
on visits plus R equals one let's let's
go talk about that cookies
you know the browser doesn't care what
datatype our cookie is you know here we
just said it's you know it's basically
this this the string it's this blob of
data and here I'm treating it like an
integer so let's let's go ahead and
update this code to make this work
properly with strings okay so we've
improved our code a little bit here I
changed our default zero to the string
zero and so that this next line will
work without exceptions if visits that
is digit remember that checks to see if
visits is made up of only only digits in
which case we can safely convert it to
an integer and we add one to it so we
increment visits every time otherwise we
just set visits to zero and that's what
we print okay so let's give this a whirl
so now we've got our page here and I
reload it the arrow went away and we can
see this counting up pretty neat huh so
that count is stored in a cookie in this
browser the server has no idea what the
count is so let's go ahead and add some
functionality to further my agenda now
what we want to do is let's let's do
something with this cookie value let's
say we want to reward users who've been
to our website a hundred times with a
special message of thanks so let's let's
do it like let's let's make some changes
here we'll say if visits is greater than
100 self dot right you are the best ever
and for everybody else we'll just tell
them how many times they've been here
let's see this in action
actually so we want to we want to do it
on hundred but let's go ahead and test
it on ten so we don't have to reload the
page 100 times just to make sure this
works okay so I'm going to save this and
we're gonna go to our browser and give
it a shot conveniently I'm at nine times
we reload
ten times aha greater than ten after I
reloaded it switched to you are the best
ever great we feel very good let's go
back to our code and change that time to
100 so change there 10 to 100 go back to
our browser we keep reloading again okay
so we really want to see our our special
message but it's going to take us a
while to get there we're not to sit here
and reload the page actually let's make
this a hundred thousand okay we're never
going to get there we're going to have
to be a super loyal user to get up to
that amount so what I'd like you to do
is think about how we might cheat the
system a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
