that I just mentioned what we want to
ask is the question can virtualization
help we've seen how virtualization is a
powerful technique for hosting multiple
operating system images on the same
Hardware without a significant loss of
performance in the context of a single
processor now the question is can this
idea be extended to a multiprocessor and
this is the thought experiment that was
carried out at Stanford in the cellular
disco project cellular disco combines
the idea of virtualization and the needs
for scalability of parallel operating
system commensurate with the underlying
hardware so there is a thin
virtualization layer which is the
cellular disco layer and the cellular
disco layer manages the hardware
resources namely CPU the i/o devices
memory management and so on now the most
hairy part in dealing with any operating
system is the i/o management even in a
desktop environment on a PC environment
most of the code is really third party
code that is device driver code that is
sitting inside the operating system and
so that is the thing that is one of the
harry potter managing the i/o subsystem
so in this thought experiment what
cellular disco does is to show by
construction that you can alleviate some
of the pain points and building an
operating system especially with respect
to i/o management so I'm going to focus
on just the i/o management part and on
how I 0 is handled with the cellular
disco sitting in the middle between the
virtual machine that is sitting on top
and the physical Hardware sitting at the
bottom so this particular thought
experiment was conducted on and a
machine called the origin 2000 from SGI
if it 32 node the machine and that was
the shared memory multiprocessor on
which this thought experiment was
conducted and the operating system is a
flavor of unix operating system called
eric's that's the host operating system
running on
of the origin 2000 the VMM layer
cellular disco sits in between the guest
operating system and the host operating
system and the way virtualization is
done is a standard virtual machine trick
and that is trap and emulate and what
they have done is shown by construction
that it is possible to do this and do
this efficiently and let's just walk
through what happens on an i/o request
the guest operating system makes an i/o
request and this results in a trap into
the VMM layer cellular disco cellular
disco rewrites this request as coming
from it rather than from the guest
operating system and makes the actual
i/o request this is the virtual request
coming from the guest operating system
so this is the actual i/o request that
is passed down to the host operating
system I ricks in this case and the
idexx operating system does his own
thing that whatever the device driver is
going to do and carries out that
operation and once that operation has
been scheduled it might indicate that
yes i have scheduled it let's say it's a
DMA operation so it might say that yes
have scheduled it sends it up to the the
host Alex operating system and the host
idx operating system passes it to
cellular disco passes it to the guest
operating system so this is the path of
dispatching and i/o request now what
happens when the i/o request actually
completes this is where the trick comes
in of trap and emulate because cellular
disco has made it appear that this
request is really coming from it it is
installed when it gave this i/o request
it installed in it the place that needs
to be called in the VMM layer so when
the completion in trip comes in normally
in any vanilla operating system
completion interrupt will go to go to
the host operating system but cellular
disco has faked it by when it passed the
request to say that when a completion
request comes in call me that's what was
the magic that was done in the forward
path
and therefore the completion request
happens it really calls the VMM layer
and the VMM layer does what it needs to
do and makes it appear as though it's a
normal interrupt coming from the device
back to the host Alex operating system
and the host Alex operating system in
turn passes it back to cellular disco
and then on to the guest operating
system so this is the trick by which it
does the trap and emulate for dealing
with every IO subsystem so there's no
need to change any part of the i/o
subsystem in the host operating system
everything is being managed by this
trick of trap and emulate that is
happening in the cellular disco layer so
the standard virtual machine trick of
trap and emulate is being used
extensively in providing the services
that you need in a guest operating
system that is running on a
multiprocessor so the start experiment
was this was really to show by
construction how to do this idea of
developing an operating system for a new
hardware without completely rewriting
the operating system by exploiting the
facilities and then there may be there
already in the host operating system
once again this should remind you of
another thing that we have seen before
when we discussed operating system
structures and that is lead case showing
by construction that a microkernel
design can be as efficient as a
monolithic design similar to that what
these folks have done is the
construction they have shown that a
virtual machine monitor can manage the
resources of a multiprocessor as well as
a native operating system and they
showed it by construction this cellular
disco runs as a multi-threaded colonel
process on top of the host operating
system Alex in this case and the other
thing that they have shown by
construction is that the overhead of
doing it this way providing the services
that is needed for the guest operating
system through this cellular disco
virtualization layer can be kept
efficient keep the overhead low and the
virtualization can be efficient and
there
shown that it can be done within ten
percent for many applications that run
on the guest operating system so that's
the proof of the pudding is of course in
the eating and so what they've shown is
that the virtualization overhead can be
kept low by really showing how
applications can be run in the guest
operating system and through the
services provided by the VMM layer
cellular disco they show that the drop
in performance can be kept fairly low</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
