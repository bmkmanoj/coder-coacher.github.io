understood as computers communicating
across the Internet we define the client
as the computer that wants information
and the server as the computer that has
information that can be shared with
clients this means that a client has to
initiate communication to request
information while the server constantly
stays listening for any clients to
communicate with it and responds with
the data that the client requested let's
briefly discuss some of the important
concepts in order to better understand
how this actually happens so we know
that clients and servers can communicate
with each other but how do we know that
they're all speaking the same language
well protocols are like the grammatical
rules that we use to make sure all
machines on the internet are
communicating in the same way there are
several protocols that computers on the
internet adhere to the most common three
of the transmission protocol or TCP the
Internet Protocol IP and the hypertext
transfer protocol or HTTP the
transmission control protocol or TCP
enables information to be broken into
small packets and sent between clients
and servers if a packet is lost
somewhere along the way the sender and
receiver have a way of figuring out
which of the packets is missing and
request that they be recent the
counterpart to TCP is UDP user Datagram
protocol which is good for streaming
content like music or video similar to
postal addresses IP addresses allow
messages to be properly routed to all
participants on the Internet for
simplicity's sake we can assume that
every device in the internet gets an IP
address that is either statically or
dynamically assigned by the Internet
service provider here's the IP address
of my laptop and here's the IP address
for google when i type google com into
my browser my computer first figures out
the IP address of google by looking it
up in a domain name server or DNS think
of dns as a big online phone book that
finds the IP addresses of web urls once
dns gives my computer the IP address it
uses that edges to initiate
communication with the server for google
since multiple applications using the
internet can run on one machine
operating systems use ports to designate
channels of communication on the same ip
address placing the colon after an IP
address with another number indicates
that we want to communicate on a
specific port on the device using that
IP address on most machines port numbers
can range from 0
to 65536 the first 10,000 ports are
oftentimes reserved by the operating
system for specific use port 80 is the
most common port for web servers so most
websites we use every day are hitting
port 80 when they reach a server 8080 is
also a common port for web
communications when client and server
applications are on the same machine we
indicate this with the term local host
localhost also has a special IP address
of 127 001 whenever we type localhost
are the special IP address into a
browser or web application the operating
system knows to look for this resource
locally and not go out to the internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
