structure across the course it's not
centralized in one place like the bus so
not all requests have to go to the same
part of the directory each slice of the
directory will serve a set of blocks
where a slice of the directory is the
part of the directory that is next to a
particular core and that means that
different blocks will be served by
slices that are in different places and
that's how we achieve a higher bandwidth
because really each slice could operate
independently because it serves at this
joint set of blocks what does a slice do
it has one entry for each block served
by that slice and the entry for a block
tracks which caches in the system have
this block in a non invalid State of
course because the block in an invalid
state is like it's not in that cache at
all and the order of access is for a
particular block is determined by the
home slice for that block that's the
slice of the directory that has the
entry for this block we call that the
home slice of the directory so pretty
much accesses would go to the same block
are almost serialized in how they can
access their entry and the order in
which that happens is the order in which
the accesses are officially said to
happen note that with the directory
protocol the cash is still have the same
States they did with snooping is just
now when we send a request to read or
write that request no longer goes on a
bus it gets sent via our network to the
directory so we can have many requests
traveling to that individual slices and
then the directory figures out what to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
