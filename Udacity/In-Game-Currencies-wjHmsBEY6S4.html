currency you can use to purchase in-app
items soft currency and hard currency
soft currency is easy to get and is
often used to pay for consumables
whereas hard currency is more difficult
to get n is used to get rare items or
entitlements soft currency is easy to
get because it's very grind a bowl and
grind double just means that you can
play parts of the game like levels or
mini games over and over again to
accumulate soft currency so the more
time you spend playing a game the more
soft currency you slowly accumulate one
example of this is fruit ninjas star
fruit currency players accumulate star
fruit over time as they play the game
and once they save up enough they can
use these star fruits to buy consumables
like bomb deflects or game power-ups
hard currency is between real money and
soft currency it's difficult to earn and
can also usually be bought with real
money like we mentioned before it's
often used to pay for entitlements or
other rare items in fruit ninja golden
apples are hard currency you can only
earn them by paying real money for them
or by watching offer wall ads these
apples are used to unlock levels and
tournament challenges so if you want a
fun multiplayer challenge you'll have to
pay hard currency for that entitlement
let's look at some other examples of
in-game currencies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
