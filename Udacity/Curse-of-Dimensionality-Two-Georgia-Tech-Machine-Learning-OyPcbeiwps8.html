little line segment okay and let's say
I've got ten little points that I could
put down on this line segment and I want
them all to represent some part of this
line all right
that's kind of K nearest neighbor e ish
so I put a little X here I put one here
and I put one here one here one here
here here here here here is a 10 3 6 9 a
10 10 okay and let's pretend I did the
right thing here and I have them kind of
uniformly distributed across the line
segment so that means each one of these
points is sort of owning an equal size
sub segment of the segments that make
sense yeah so so it's representing it in
a sense that that point when you're
trying to estimate values of other
places on the line it's going to default
as the nearest neighbor to being that
point so there's a very small little
neighborhood of the red line segment
that is covered by each of the green X's
that's exactly right and in fact each
one of these green axis represents how
much of this segment each of the green
X's covers 1/10 that's exactly right
you cover 1/10 all right Michael so
let's say that I move from a line
segment now to a two-dimensional space
so a little square segment if that's the
right technical term and I've taken my
little 10 X's and I put them down here
before well so here's something you'll
notice you'll notice that each one of
these X's is going to still end up
representing one tenth of all of this
space but you'll also notice that the
tip that is representing is now you know
really really really really big
I see so one way of putting it is you
know if you think about the farthest
point as opposed to the furthest point
which would be incorrect the farthest
point that this particular first X over
here is representing it's got some
distance here over here the farthest
point from this X the distance is very
very far away so a question would be how
could I make it so that each of the X's
I put down represents the same
amount of I don't know diameter or
distance as the X's in this line segment
over here so what do you think I'd have
to do I feel like you need to fill up
the square with X's yeah that's exactly
right so let's do that so filling them
up Michael as you suggested you'll
notice that at least if we pretend that
I drew this right each of these X's is
now going to end up being the nearest
neighbor for a little square like this
and the diameter of these little squares
are going to be the same as the diameter
of these little line segments okay I
agree for some definition of the word
but diameter yes and for some definition
of I drew them straight okay so how many
of these X's are there Michael can you
tell you wanna count I'm gonna multiply
cuz it looks like you did 10 by 10 maybe
100 there'll be 100 so each one now
holds a hundredth of the space and I
went from needing 10 points to of course
100 points in order to cover the same
amount of space all right so that
definitely seems like the mild rebuke of
dimensionality yes but doesn't seem that
bad
okay well what happens if I now move
into three dimensions so now if I want
to cover the same amount of you know
diameter space for you know sufficient
definition of dynamic I'm going to have
to do a bunch of copying and pasting
that I'm not willing to do so you know
there'll be more X's here and you know
that the X is here and the beam
experiment
you know I'm not going to do this
whatever bit and you'll get X's
everywhere and you'll notice I need a
lot more X's than I had before and by
the way I'm just showing you the outside
of this little cube there are actually
X's on the inside as well that you can't
see how many X's do you think I have I
don't think it drew any X's you're just
like scribbling on the side of the cube
these are X's you're doing so well for a
while and then just lost it entirely
well wouldn't you lose it if you had to
drag 1,000 X's no because I would use
computers to help me but yes yes it is
very frustrating to have to have that
many X's and but in particular in this
case we're talking about data points in
a nearest neighbor method and that boy
that does seem like a big growth from
and 200,000 in fact the growth is
exponential right so if we went into
four dimensions which I I'm not going to
draw then we would need not a thousand
but 10,000 points and in five dimensions
we would need 100,000 points and six
dimensions we would need a million
points and so on and so forth
so something like 10 to the D where D is
the number of dimensions Wow right so
this is really problematic right if I
won in my little nearest neighbor method
to be able to say well I want to make
certain that the neighborhood remains
small as I add dimensions I'm going to
need to grow the number of points that I
have in my training set exponentially
that's really bad and by the way this
isn't just an issue of K and n this is
true in general don't think about this
now as nearest neighbors in the sense of
K n but think of it as points that are
representing or covering the space and
if you want to represent the same sort
of hyper volume of space as you add
dimensions you're going to have to get
exponentially more points in order to do
that and coverage is necessary to do
learning so the curse of dimensionality
is not just apply to K n it is a curse
of dimensionality for ML period you mean
for me yes
the curse of michael Lippmann ality ye
okay and that seems really problematic
because it's very natural to just keep
throwing dimensions into a machine
learning problem like it's having
trouble learning let me give it a few
more dimensions so to give it hints but
really what you're doing is just giving
it a larger and larger volume to fill
yeah and it can't fill it unless you
give it more and more data so you're
better off giving more data than you are
giving more dimensions swings mm-hmm
there's an entire series of lessons that
we will get to eventually that that
deals with this issue the issue of
dimensionality finding the right
dimensionality yeah that would be a
useful thing it would but it's far off
in the future it's like infinitely far
in the future so I worry about that in a
few weeks okay okay all right so there
you go Michael cursor dimensionality is
real and it's a real problem where did
that term come from it's a cool term I
think it came from what's-his-name
a bellman Oh bellman like the dynamic
programming guy yeah the dynamic
programming guy
the bellman of bellman equation guy
which we haven't gotten to yet in the
course which we haven't gotten to in the
course but we will get to in the course
because it's central so it looks like
actually bellman central to a lot of
things Wow sometimes it gives us
equations it helps us but sometimes he
gives us curses curses bellman foiled
