always applied element-wise let's start
with simple multiplication operation
here we define a simple array so that we
can easily track the changes this will
multiply each element by - let's check
the output when using arithmetic
operation a new array is created and the
values are stored in that array so our
original array a still holds the same
values and this is our new array which
we get after multiplying array a by 2
observe that it is element wise
multiplication
let's try division here we use the
division operation to divide each
element of array a by 2 let's check the
output observe that when you divide 1 by
2 you get a value 0 over here instead of
0.5
this is because both the array and the
divisor are integers
if we would do 2.0 instead of 2 you will
get float values keep this point in mind
before performing division in general
that is int divided by int will give you
an integer output to get float values
you need at least the numerator or the
denominator to be a float value
let's check the output observe that we
could successfully get a floating-point
value instead of 0
how about arithmetic operation using two
arrays we will start with addition we
create another array V with these values
now let's just add a and B using the
plus operator as mentioned this is
element wise this is a new array a plus
B one important thing to note here is
that the shape of a and B should be
similar before the operation a plus B
else it will throw error similar to the
addition you can perform subtraction now
let's move ahead with multiplying two
arrays this is interesting because
unlike other many matrix languages
multiplication operator when used with
two array will not give you matrix
product but will do element wise
multiplication that is element at
position zero zero in array a is
multiplied only with the element at
position zero zero in V let's print the
multiplication of matrix a and B can you
observe elementwise multiplication but
the next question would be what about
matrix multiplication how do you achieve
that like for everything numpy has a
function it has functioned called dot
which performs matrix multiplication
similar to multiplication division of
two arrays can be performed just include
division operators between the two
arrays
let's check the output as seen before
since array a and B are integers we get
the final array in the form of integers
as well if you want to see floating
values convert one of the arrays to
float well that's all for now keep
practicing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
