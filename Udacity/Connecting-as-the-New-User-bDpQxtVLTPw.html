go ahead and connect to our server as
that user I've opened a new terminal
here and this terminal is on my local
machine
I have not connected to the server yet I
can connect to the server using this
command ssh student 1 2700 1 P 22 22
let's break this command down a little
bit we've been connecting to our server
using vagrant SSH which is just a
shortcut for all of this SSH is the
application we use to remotely connect
to the server and 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1
is the IP address we want to connect to
this is a standard IP address that
always means localhost or the same
computer I am currently on the student
at is the user we want to log in as we
want to log in as student at this IP
address
finally the dash P 2222 flag tells us to
connect using port 22 22 when vagrants
set up our virtual machine it
automatically set up this port on our
local machine to forward to the virtual
machine after hitting enter you may be
asked an authenticity verification
question just hit yes and then you're
asked for the users password enter that
and you'll be logged in as the student</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
