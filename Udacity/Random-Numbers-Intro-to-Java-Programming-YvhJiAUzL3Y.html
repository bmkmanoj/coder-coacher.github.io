that simulate some activity such as
customers in a supermarket cars and
erode particles in the physical system
and in such simulations you want to have
a degree of randomness just to model how
the real world works for example some
random time might elapse until the next
customer arrives or the customer might
buy a random number of articles so let
me show you how to generate random
numbers in Java if you construct an
object of the random class and then you
can ask it to give you another integer
you have to give it an upper limit and
you get an integer between 0 and n minus
1 you can also generate a random
floating point number and then you
always get a number that's at least 0
but less than 1 let me show you the
random number generator in bluej let's
make an object by going to the Tools
menu use library class and here in the
class field we type in Java dot util dot
random and hit the enter key select this
constructor and here we have a random
number generator let's ask it for next
double and we get 0.05 and change that
looks pretty random next time when we
ask it we get a different random number
0.19 and so on for integers we'll pick
this method over here we asked for an
upper bound and now get a number that's
between 0 and 999 in this case I get 781
when I do it again I get a different
number of course every once in a while I
might get the same number twice it's
random now I'll let you play with this
we want to simulate a die so that we get
random numbers 1 between 1 and 6 or
actually we might as well model a die
with an arbitrary number of sides and
your job is to implement the cast method
so that every time that it's called it
returns a different number between 1 and
the number of sides of the die there's
just a catch you're going to have to
call the next int method which naturally
gives you numbers between 0 and n minus
1 you want numbers from 1 to n and I'll
leave it to you to figure out how to
change one to the other has a
construction parameter for debugging
it's handy to give the random number
generator what's called a seed and as
as you see the generator with a
particular value then it gives always
the same stream of seemingly random
numbers here we're using a fixed seed so
that you and I get the same answers and
practical applications people do all
sorts of things for seeding such as
using the time of day or when true
randomness is desired they actually have
a white noise generator attached to
their computer and sample it so go ahead
and implement the cast method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
