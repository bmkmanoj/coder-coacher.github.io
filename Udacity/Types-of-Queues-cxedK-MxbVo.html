serial or synchronous skills and
concurrent or asynchronous cues serial
Keys behave as explained earlier every
closure gets to run when it reaches the
end of the queue on the other hand
concurrent or asynchronous cues have
several threads that pick up closures at
any point of the queue for running these
are harder to control and we won't be
using them an app can have several cues
but not all cues are created equal there
is a very special one called
the main queue this is the queue that
handles the UI of your app as well as
any of your code that doesn't explicitly
ask to run in a background queue it is
vital that you never run code that
blocks on this queue what does it mean
to block blocking is when your code
takes a human perceivable amount of time
to execute and prevents your app from
continuing until it's done
you can do this either by doing
something computationally expensive such
as applying a filter to a video or a big
image however the most common way of
blocking is by using the network say you
wrote some code to make a network
request on the main queue then none of
your UI could update until the network
request finishes we cannot allow this to
happen if you do block the main queue
your UI will be sluggish and your app
will provide a terrible user experience
Adam will likely be rejected from the
App Store we won't have any of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
