the final exam this is basically
building on everything you've learned in
this class it's just a another cohesive
project and what I'm going to ask you to
do is build a wiki for those of you who
don't know what a wiki is I will give
you a demo it should look something like
this
here's the front page of the wiki a wiki
is just a website where any page can be
edited so for example if I were to click
Edit on this page we see the HTML for
this page and I can add some text it's
at a blank line so I just added some
text in this text box and I click Save
and then we save the page and then it
has this text in here now one of the
things that's cool about a wiki or at
least and this one that we want you to
build is you can go to any URL in this
case slash new page which doesn't exist
yet and if the URL does not exist it'll
redirect you to another URL in my case
I'm using slash underscore edit and then
the page name where you can edit some
content in here and if you were to click
Save it would take you to that URL so in
my case slash new page with the content
and of course you can edit this content
let's add a link to the front page so we
just use the anchor tag with an href to
slash which is the front page and if we
click save we can see that it renders
that HTML I typed it as a link and if I
were to click on this link it'll take me
to the front page which is the slash so
we'll go through the specific
requirements and the instructor comments
but the important thing the first thing
is if you type in a URL that doesn't
exist
you go to an edit page and if you type
in two if you type in a URL that does
exist it renders the content of that
page and you can edit the content of
that page if you want now I've been
logged in this whole time
you should have user accounts integrated
in this so if I were to click logout
here it keeps me on the same page so
what this did is that that did just like
we did in unit 4 it cleared my user
cookie and then just redirected me to
the page that I came from and I can view
any page locked out and I can view the
front page as well but I can't edit any
page you see the Edit link is gone now
we can't grade how things look very well
so we're not going to bother doing that
but we will try to submit an edit form
while being logged out and that should
fail now I will log back in now you know
it's the same signup form we've been
using all along actually in the version
I put online I'll probably clean this up
a little bit before I do that because
it's been bugging me
code but this is actually the exact same
code we've been using the whole time
I'll log in as my user and you can see
now I have a new edit link so that's the
gist of the you know the main wiki of
course instead of clicking login I could
also click signup to create a new user
and this is the same form we've been
using for this entire class you know the
the the errors and whatnot if I were to
try to create a user that already exists
I'd give that that error let's log in as
a different user space to click Submit
and I'm logged in as best to that is the
main test that I would ask you to do log
in log out you've already done that
editing a page you know it's basically a
simple form submission and some fancy
redirecting there again well in the
structure comments will include more
specifically how to do that when you
have that working submit the URL here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
