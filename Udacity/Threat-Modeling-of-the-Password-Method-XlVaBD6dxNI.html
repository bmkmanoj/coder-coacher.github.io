security of your system somebody who's
not authorized is trying to access your
sensitive data how can they attack if
what they're asked to attack or what
allowed to attack is the authentication
part of whatever security you have in
your system so authentication is how you
start so the target of that hacker here
is going to be how you authenticate in
particular what they're going to try to
do is defeat the authentication system
so eva is going to try to be successful
in authenticating herself as Alice in
that case you would have successfully
compromised the authentication method so
we're going to do this threat modeling
saying well what can they do what can
the bad guy or that hacker do well I
just sort of talked about the password
method so remember the password method
is something you know and we all know
what passwords are so let's say you know
passwords are being used by users to log
into a system what kind of threats do we
need to be concerned about well it's a
secret that's shared between you and the
system while someone can try to guess
that secret so one thread is it or not
having good passwords that can be easily
guessed by attackers that's one threat
we have to be concerned about
authentication that is based on
passwords so this is kind of interesting
it really is not talking about how can
you be a user guess their password or
steal the token but it's talking about
impersonating a real login program so
think about you come in and we talk
about passwords you provide your
password to the system how do you know
you're really talking to the system how
do you know it's not a program that is
impersonating the system all it has to
do depending on what system you have it
has to display login Colin or something
like that for you to provide a login ID
or login name and then it has to display
password colon so you can type your
password or whatever the interface that
you have this is a Trojan horse this is
a program that is impersonating the
system at the other end
then what this program is able to do is
as you type your password it will be
able to steal it now what's the last one
we're talking with someone trying to
steal your password isn't it if your
computer is infected in particular if
it's infected with malicious software
that called keyloggers they able to
capture the keys that you praise you're
going to provide your password by
pressing a bunch of keys so keylogger
grabs your password okay so if you're
doing a password method bad guy has to
get hold of your password so they can
become you they can guess it they can
steal it either using a piece of
software that fools you into believing
that you're giving your password to the
operating system or it could run as the
real login program is running and steal
these keys that you press or the
characters that you press that make up
your password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
