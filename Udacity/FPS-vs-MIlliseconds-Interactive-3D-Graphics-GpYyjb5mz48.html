way to talk about an application as a
whole if an application runs at 10
frames per second on one system and 20
frames per second on another we can
truthfully say the second system is
about twice as fast in this instance
however graphics programmers themselves
have been moving towards using the
inverse of frames per second
milliseconds per frame there are a
number of good reasons for this
the most important is that milliseconds
give you a solid number for use in
comparison of different algorithms if
you talk about an algorithms
implementation in terms of milliseconds
per frame you can then treat the effect
on speed as a single number this user
interface is costing us five
milliseconds per frame is a useful fact
in its own right this user interface
slows us down by 10 frames per second is
not all that helpful since we don't know
what the frame rate was before reading
individual parts of the rendering
process by frames per second doesn't
make a lot of sense since it's the sum
of the costs that's important you can
add millisecond costs together to see
how much a frame will typically take
games for example will often have a
budget say of thirty three point three
milliseconds per frame which means 30
frames per second if different effects
cost various amounts of time it's easier
to add these up and see if we're over
budget if an application aims for 60
frames per second the budgets halved
another reason to avoid frames per
second is that they're difficult to work
with mathematically so of course that's
what I'm going to ask you to do to get a
feel for this sort of problem you
measure your application say it's a
walkthrough of a building here are the
rates you find 25 frames per second for
100 frames 50 frames per second for the
next hundred frames 25 frames per second
for the next hundred frames and then 10
frames per second for the last hundred
frames of your benchmark what is the
average speed of the application in
frames per second I'll give you a hint
simply averaging the frames per second
values is not going to work think about
how many frames are rendered in how many
seconds pass during the entire benchmark
you might want to translate this problem
to thinking about miles per hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
