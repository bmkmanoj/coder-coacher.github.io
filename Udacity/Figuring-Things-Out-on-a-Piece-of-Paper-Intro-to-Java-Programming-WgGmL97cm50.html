the car class but if you have another
look at the drive method remember that
we didn't update the gas in tank
variable that computation is a little
bit trickier let's first figure it out
on a sheet of paper so let's say we
drive a hundred miles
how much gas does that take well of
course that depends on the fuel
efficiency let's assume there we have a
car with great mileage fifty miles per
gallon well then the gas consumed is 100
miles divided by the fuel efficiency or
true gallons right 50 miles for one
gallon 50 miles for another gallon for a
total of 100 miles that's something that
we can easily program in Java and here
is the formula let's put that into our
code of course that just tells us how
much gas was consumed during the drive
we still need to update the instance
variable let's do that here it is we
reduce gas and tank by the amount of gas
that was consumed and we need to set
this variable here for now we'll just
use the value of 50 miles per gallon
will later see how we can make every car
have its own fuel efficiency now how do
we know that we did this right this
would be a good opportunity for a tester
program and that's what I want you to do
next right a tester that constructs a
new car fill the car with gas drive the
car show the gas level after the drive
and most importantly print the expected
value that's what makes it a tester go
ahead do that in the coding environment
and then we'll compare notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
