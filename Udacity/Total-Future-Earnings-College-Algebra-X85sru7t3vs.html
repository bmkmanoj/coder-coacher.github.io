for the amount of money that grant would
earn if all of his original orders had
gone through was equal to 87 w plus 72 n
but this was before any orders have been
cancelled and in the last quiz we just
found out how much money grant would
have earned from the orders that are now
cancelled and that was just equal to 3w
plus 12n dollars a couple of quizzes ago
we also found an equation for Grant's
total future earnings taking these
cancelled orders into account of course
was a pretty general equation that
didn't have any variables and numbers in
it yet we said that his total future
earnings will be equal to the money from
all of the original orders minus the
money he would have made from the orders
that are now cancelled so let's combine
all this information using substitution
into a single equation for Grant's total
future earnings so which of these
expressions down here would correctly
replace the question mark to come up
with an equation for Grant's total
future earnings taking the cost of each
wiper and nozzle into account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
