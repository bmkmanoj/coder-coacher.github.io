different devices is to make an app for
each device and platform as they become
available and adopted by users this is
typically meant a new project for each
and every device developed and supported
independently for most of us we actually
think of the experience on any of these
devices as part of a single whole
experience for the user with our service
approaching each as a separate project
as well it's just the wrong way to go
about it instead you're going to want to
think about having a view into your
service from every device that makes
sense this is really the definition of
ubiquitous computing where your service
is available anywhere and everywhere
each view into your service will differ
slightly depending on the features
available and what the user needs in
that context but taken as a whole these
views lead to a single seamless
experience for the user across their
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
