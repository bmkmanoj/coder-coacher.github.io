with aria-live to fine-tune what is
communicated to the user when the live
region changes are a atomic indicates
whether the entire region should be
considered as a whole when communicating
updates for example if we couldn't use a
date input we might want to create a
date which it consisting of a step of
each of day month and year with
aria-live equals polite and aria atomic
equals true on the container node if the
user used the month stepper to change
the month value alone the full contents
of the date widget would be read out the
value for aria atomic may be true or
false with false being the default this
means that you don't need to explicitly
specify when Aria atomic is false
Aria irrelevant indicates what types of
changes should be presented to the user
there are three distinct options which
may be used separately or as a token
list additions removals and text an aria
relevant value of additions means that
any element being added to the live
region is significant for example
appending a span to a log of chat
messages would mean that the span would
be announced to the user
assuming that Aria atomic was false an
aria relevant value of text implies that
text content being added to any
descendent node is relevant regardless
of whether a new element is actually
added for example changing the text
content of our alert bar would trigger
an announcement even though we haven't
actually added a descendent element and
an aria relevant value of removals
implies that moving any text or any
descendant element should trigger an
announcement the default value for Aria
relevant is additions text meaning that
adding either a descendent element or
adding text content through some other
mechanism is significant this is the
most common situation so it's really
necessary to specify Aria relevant
explicitly there's also an all option
which is shorthand for additions
removals text meaning that literally any
change is significant finally
are you busy lets us notify assistive
technology that it should temporarily
ignore changes to this element such as
when things are loading say after a
temporary connectivity lapse
once everything is back in place are a
busy should be set to false</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
