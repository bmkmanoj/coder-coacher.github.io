of matches in the first professional
human go player against a AI player just
playing at the professional level and to
sort of help you get into that we're
going to teach you guys how to play go
the rules of go are actually fairly
simple there's only a handful of rules
this game is actually played between two
players one of them is going to play
with the black stones and one person is
going to play with the white stones and
they're going to alternate so first turn
is the black players turn and on each
players turn they're going to place one
stone on the board the first role of
game is each turn somebody takes a stone
and places it on the board and it
alternates the game ends when each
player decides that their position is
good enough and they both pass in
succession that's just the general
gameplay that's the general flow of the
game
the next thing to remember is how stones
are captured so stones are placed on the
intersections of the board in each of
these intersections is touching for
additional intersections these are
called the liberties of a stone and when
the liberties are all taken up by pieces
of the opposing color so when the fourth
stone is played then the opposing stone
is captured it's taken as a hostage and
it will count as points against the
opposing player at the end of the game
however when you have stones of the same
color they share their liberties so a
stone like this this black stone here is
connected to its partner here and they
both share liberties of course if all of
these liberties are taken then the two
black stones are captured and so the
idea of the game is to try and make sure
that your stones are in a good formation
so that they live so that they are able
to get you territory the person has the
most territory wins so what is this
concept of territory well territory is
actually the
out of the board that you are holding
down so for example we might have an
area of the board that looks something
like this
well in this situation it's very
unlikely that the black player is going
to be able to play within this area
and be able to make any opportunity of
living this is considered White's
territory at the end of the game they're
going to score points according to the
number of intersections on the board
that they have in their possession so in
this case they're going to have three by
four so this is going to give the white
player 12 points at the end of the game
tally all of those together and then
subtract the number of hostages that the
black player took and that will be their
score for the game normally there is a
rule in place that because the black
player starts first they have an
advantage because they have an extra
stone on the board pretty much all the
time and so the white player is going to
get a few points seven-and-a-half points
added to their score as compensation
let's talk a little bit about the
complexity of this game one stone at a
time on this 19 by 19 grid that's a lot
of things to worry about
humans have you know the ability to look
at images and process them quickly and
have an intuition about how territories
look and how sort of the game feels in
chess for example computers previously
have done exhaustive searches and chess
it's fairly easy because you have 16
pieces that you can move and they can
only move a certain limited number of
ways for go on average you're going to
have 200 different locations per move
and that can be a lot it explodes
exponentially and quickly if you try to
do any kind of exhaustive search and
some computers have to do some very
smart things very smart heuristics in
order to be able to compete on the same
level as a human and that's exactly
what's going to be put to the test this
week
