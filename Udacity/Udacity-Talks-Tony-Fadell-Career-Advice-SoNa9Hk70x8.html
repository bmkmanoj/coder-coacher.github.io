covee advice you've ever received from a
mentor in your life you always have to
continually learn so for like nano
degrees if you're in your well employed
you should be doing nano degrees because
you have to constantly learn so that was
the first thing my mentor told me the
second thing is know when to say no now
that must be hard it's very how did you
learn how to say no well I learned it
from Steve Jobs there's so many things
you could be doing and his job was to
say no to so many things and yes to only
those things that really mattered so you
have to really be able to focus your
ever effort your passion your emotion
your energy on those things because you
can only do something so well if you
focus what is the advice for someone
over 50 years old to transition into new
technologies if you've had success and
you've shown success and learning along
the ways of success out of failure
they're going to see that and they're
going to see your passion because it's
no different than running to when you
were 20 years old when you when you
didn't know anything right so if you
have a career and you just say I'm
switching careers I'm changing it but
you're taking this wealth of knowledge
into a new domain the thing with
employers is that they always want
multidisciplinary people yeah they want
people from all kinds of different
backgrounds to bring it there so if they
see oh my god you have this wealth of
knowledge from this other thing that's
going to help me with whatever i'm
creating and you wanted to learn this
too they're going i want to learn from
you your your experience and you're
going to learn from me this new
experience you want to learn if it's a
if it's a if it's a two-way street of
learner's both parties or both parties
are succeed together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
