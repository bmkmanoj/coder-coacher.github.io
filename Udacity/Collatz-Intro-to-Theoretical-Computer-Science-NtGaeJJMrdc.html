more formally as the Colette's series
named after the german mathematician
Luda collets and it behaves somewhat
erratic as I think you've seen with a
program sometimes it will terminate very
quickly for certain values of I and
sometimes actually it will behave super
erratic and it will go up and down and
up and down until it finally terminates
now here's the thing it has been
conjectured that this algorithm here
will terminate for any value of I but so
far nobody has been able to prove that
so if we were given an integer for this
function here for which the Khaled's
hypothesis that this algorithm here
always terminates has not been verified
then that would indeed be undecidable
now truth be told it would have to be a
very large integer because the Khaled's
hypothesis has been verified for large
numbers indeed nevertheless once the
integers out of this range we have no
way of deciding whether this algorithm
would terminate or not the only thing we
can do is run it so the Cullens problem
or Colette's hypothesis is an open
mathematical problem and of course as
you know it's not the only open
mathematical problem so we could have
other mathematical problems as well
but I want to show you something so if
we had an algorithm that solves the
halting problem so if we indeed had this
algorithm halt what we could then do for
example is write the following program
for I equals 1 to say 10 to the power of
100 then run the Kaulitz rules for I so
we start with I equals 1 then we go to I
equals 2 and so on and then we feed this
problem into the halting algorithm and
now if the halting algorithm says yes
then this means that the Kaulitz
hypothesis is true for any number from 1
to 10 to the power of 100 and if it says
no then it means that there is some
number for which the Kaulitz hypothesis
is not true which means that this part
here would go into an infinite loop and
then we can easily check this for larger
and larger and larger numbers an
algorithm that would be able to solve
the halting problem would actually be
able to solve almost any open
mathematical problem there is out there
any mathematical problem that can be
formulated as an algorithm could be
decided by an algorithm that solves the
halting problem so this would almost be
a kind of omniscient algorithm which
also provides an intuition why this
whole
algorithm here cannot possibly exist it
would just simply be too powerful it
could answer almost any mathematical
question that we can think of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
