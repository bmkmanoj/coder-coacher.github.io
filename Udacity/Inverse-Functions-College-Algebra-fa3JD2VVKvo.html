functions we've been talking about has a
special name they are inverse functions
of one another as I said before just
looking at these equations we might not
have any idea right off the bat that
these functions are inverses to help
make that more clear immediately there's
a special notation we can use let's say
that we have a function that we're
calling f then if f has an inverse we
can write that in verse like this f with
a little negative one up here to the
right now we have to be super careful
when we use this notation this does not
I repeat does not mean 1 over F the
negative one here is not an exponent we
read this as f inverse not up to the
negative one to make sure that we're
keeping everything straight now let's
suppose that F in this case is f of X
equals 3x minus one right away we can
plug in values for X to figure out
different points on the line I'll just
pick out a few for right now we have 0
comma negative 1 1 comma 2 and negative
one comma negative 4 we don't know the
equation for the inverse of F quite yet
but we do know that we can denote it
like this and we actually know quite a
bit more information about this because
of these points here based on the
information we have about the function f
well points do we know will lie on f
inverse below each of these points that
lie on F please write the corresponding
points on F inverse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
