compute statistical results we report
those results in something called a
results section so I'm going to outline
a little bit what goes into results
sections the first thing we put in our
results sections are descriptive
statistics for example the mean and
standard deviation the descriptive
statistics represent the heart of our
study this tells us exactly what
happened in our study and should always
be reported and we can report those in
three ways we could report them in text
in other words we put them right in in
between our words in our results section
we can put them in graphs such as a bar
graph or we can put them in tables next
we want to report our inferential
statistics and this is either a
hypothesis test or our confidence
interval or sometimes both so in
reporting a hypothesis test you want to
give the reader the following and pieces
of information you want to tell the
reader what kind of test did you conduct
for example a one sample t-test next you
want to give the actual value of the
test statistic for example the value of
T then you provide the degrees of
freedom of the test not the formula but
the actual number that comes from the
formula you also want to give the reader
the p-value specifically the exact
p-value if possible next if applicable
give the direction of the test for
example is it a one tailed test or a
two-tailed test and always provide the
alpha level always let the reader know
what alpha level you used to make your
decisions for many disciplines we use
APA style to report the results of our
hypothesis tests APA stands for American
Psychological Association the APA has a
whole guide on writing research papers
and one of the parts of that guide tells
us how to write our inferential
statistical results I'm going to give
you a little brief introduction to APA
style for statistics as it relates to
the t-test so here's a generic outline
of how to present the results of a
t-test in APA style first we put the
test statistic name that in this case
it's T next to that we put the degrees
of freedom in parentheses we put an
equal sign then we provide the T value
rounded to two decimal places with a
comma then we give the p-value again
rounded to two decimal places there are
some exception to this rule but for the
most part this is how you do it
and then we put another comma and we
tell the direction of the test where
there's one-tailed or two-tailed I'll
give you a more concrete example and a
little bit imagine a situation in which
we have a t-value with 24 degrees of
freedom equals negative 2.5 oh if we're
doing it by hand we only know whether
the p-value is less than or greater than
point zero five and we have one tailed
test this is how you'd write it out if
we used a computer to get these results
we'd end up with an exact p-value and
the exact one-tailed p-value for this
situation rounded to two decimal places
is point zero one so in that case we
could actually put P equals point zero
