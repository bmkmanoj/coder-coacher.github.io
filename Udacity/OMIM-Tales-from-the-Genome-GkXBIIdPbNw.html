frequent in sub-saharan Africa is
because the allele makes a person
partially resistant to malaria which is
endemic to the region now if we move to
another geography like North America
where there isn't a prevalence of
malaria we've now changed the selection
pressure and the sickle cell allele is
diluted out over time so that it occurs
at a much lower frequency you recall
from just a couple of exercises back
that the homozygous sickle cell allele
condition only happens about 1 in 5,000
people in north america in the united
states whereas roughly 1 in 50 in
certain parts of sub-saharan africa are
affected by sickle cell anemia this has
everything to do with the heterozygote
having an advantage in malaria strick in
africa so obviously understanding how
and why certain alleles exists and calls
traits in a population is a detailed
adventure that requires a lot of
investigation there's actually a great
website out there to help it's called
omim or online Mendelian inheritance in
man omim is a database that catalogs all
the known diseases with a genetic
component and when possible links them
to the relevant genes in the human
genome and provides references for
further research and tools for genomic
analysis of a catalog gene you can see
here the entry for sickle-cell anemia
which has a very large page that has a
huge description of the disease tons of
published research about it and eating
is a detailed description of the alleles
that cause the various phenotypes so we
can pick any disease that you know that
has a genetic component like cystic
fibrosis and you can search and find
information about the disease as well as
the genetic variations that are known to
cause it if you're curious about other
diseases you should check them out in
the omim database there will be a link
to it in the instructors notes of this
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
