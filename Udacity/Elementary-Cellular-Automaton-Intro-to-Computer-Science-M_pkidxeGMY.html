how we take an input string which in
this case is dot dot X dot dot dot dot
and we change it according to some rules
now the rules are look at three
characters in the string and change the
middle one according to the rules that
we have here don't worry about the
numbers for the moment I'll come to
those later so for this particular 3 we
have dot dot X now X says change the
middle element so that it's an X so on
the next string the new string that
position is going to be an X the
position before it dot dot dot well dot
dot becomes a dot in the middle now at
the end we want to link round so this
dot here has to its left a dot until
it's right a dot so we have dot dot dot
again and dot dot says change the middle
to adopt now I'm moving along the next
one we have to fill in is dot X dot dot
X dot says change the middle to an X X
dot dot X dot change the middle to an X
dot dot again middle is a dot dot dot
dot middle is a dot dot dot and then the
first one is the last one here so dot
dot dot again is a dot now that
completes one change of the string and
we're going to repeat that again
so that's the first generation this is
the second generation now normally when
you do this you'd start at the beginning
of the string but just to explain it it
was easier to show you one in the middle
so this time we'll do it from the
beginning of the string so looking at
the line above we see that the first
element in the string has adopt to its
left and adopt to its right so it's dot
dot dot so that's a dot now we have dot
dot X and dot dot X that's number two
here give
me an X dot X X is an X X X X is a dot X
X dot y dot X dot is an X dot dot dot is
a dot and dot dot dot is also a dot and
we can continue like that
and so after five generations we have
the string dot dot X X dot X X and you
see we have quite an interesting pattern
building up now we can do this for lots
of different choices of these dots and
X's in blue on the second line in fact
we can do it in 256 different ways and
in order to decide what pattern we're
going to use what rules rather we can
give this rule a number now wherever
I've got an X on the bottom row I'm
going to add up those numbers so 2 plus
4 plus 8 plus 16 and that gives me 30 so
this here uses pattern 30 now instead of
pattern 30 we could choose a different
pattern let's say we choose pattern 69
now 69 is equal to now we have to look
at these numbers above and work out how
to make 69 add to those numbers
well 128 doesn't go into 69 so we don't
need any of those 64 does so we want a
64 we don't want any 32 we don't want
any 16s nor 8 but we do need four we
don't need two and we do need one so 64
plus four plus 169 so that means that we
want one so that means we're going to
replace dot dot the middle element by an
X no twos we do have a four we don't
have an eight we don't have 16 we don't
have 32 we do have 64 and we don't have
128 so we could start off with the same
input as before
which was dot dot X dot dot dot dot so
when we have a dot at the beginning its
neighbor on the left is a dot and its
neighbor on the right is a dark we have
dot dot dot and that's replaced with an
X dot dot again is an X dot dot X is
adopt remember we're looking down here
dot X dot that's number four is an X X
dot dot dot dot dot dot is an X dot dot
dot is an X and dot dot dot is an X as
well so that's line 1 continuing with
the same thing I'll fill in a few more
lines so that we can see what happens
with the pattern and now I come to line
6 I see that I'm getting exactly the
same as I had in line five which means
line seven will also be exactly the same
now some of the values give you these
patterns that just become stable others
are just chaotic and so there's lots of
different things going on that can be
quite interesting to look at now to come
to the actual code what I'm asking you
to do is to take as input a string which
is a string of dots and X's a pattern
number which is between 0 and 255 and
you're going to have to use that to work
out where the dots and X's go you will
be supplied with this information here
in other words the numbers that
correspond to the X X I which is the
pattern that you look up and finally a
number of generations and that's a
positive integer 1 2 3 4 and so on and
your output should be the generation or
the string at that generation n so for
instance if the input string was as we
have here the pattern was 69 and the
Jenna
raishin was 5 you would return dot X dot
X dot X dot X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
