lot of there's there's a lot of stuff
that goes on from the time that you guys
get that raw data and you sort of do
your quality control your QC check
before you know I see it on my 23andme
profile page I mean is is all of that
just sort of computational biology at
that point who's looking at that data
who's organizing it what's sort of going
on there yeah it really becomes a
computational biology problem once we
get the data from the hub and that's
really where 23andme concentrates most
of our staff here are computational
biologists or software engineers that's
really where we're best so the next
major component there is called calling
that's turning the data that we get from
the lab into the AA's AG's or gee-gees
that you can download and your raw data
or produce the reports you see on our
website and that's kind of an involved
process but it in essence relies on
looking at these XY plots and making
sure that everything is where we expect
it to be and so the final results that
we get back seem to look so so curated
and so so official I mean how much of
the computational sort of side of this
is sort of deriving you know what does
this letter mean I mean how do you I
mean are you guys doing all the
literature and and selecting things and
how are those decisions made in general
so we really have a pretty big content
team at 23andme
they're the ones who scour the
literature look at what's going on in
the current science of genetics and find
out this mutation or this variant causes
this disease and it's a new discovery
then they would write up what they think
about that try to put it in language
that makes sense to our users and if it
meets our scientific criteria it goes
out to the website it is all automated
it can take time just to process the
data through through to the website but
the actual process of
taking your data calling all of the
variants and all of that is quite quick
you can think of the website is being in
two parts there's the part where we just
look at the calls that you have for
disease and the report just links that
call to the results so for example we
could say you are a carrier cystic
fibrosis because you have this variant
that's it that's a scientific challenge
to figure out what's going on in the
literature but it's not an algorithmic
challenge the other part of the website
includes things like our ancestry
composition future and our relative
finder feature those are difficult
algorithmic problems you want to take
the whole you know genotype sample all
million variants try and figure out
based on that what is this person's
ancestral composition so you can imagine
that that's actually a more complex task
and requires a lot of code taking it
from you know ABC through to the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
