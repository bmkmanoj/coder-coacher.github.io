things we did on reddit over the years
that I thought you might find
interesting kind of ways to think about
problems guys have throughout this
course I think learned the major pieces
of how you know web applications fit
together
your application servers your databases
and cookies and hashes and how HTTP
works and with that knowledge you can
build quite a few things there's still a
few concepts we haven't really talked
about if you're working on your own that
would be good to get good at a lot of it
resolves around front-end technologies
CSS I've kind of alluded to and I've
provided CSS in my examples and things
like that this is from making
controlling how your HTML looks so it
doesn't look so kind of ugly in black
and white it can be complicated and it's
a little bit of an exact science laying
out a web page but this is a technology
with understanding as well as JavaScript
javascript is a programming language
that runs in the browser your web
browser ships this code to the browser
and then the browser actually runs it
and this can manipulate your HTML it can
manipulate your JavaScript and can
actually make more requests to your
server for small pieces of data and
insert those into the page doing that is
called Ajax stands for asynchronous
JavaScript basically making HTTP calls
in the background to your web server to
update the page dynamically and many
many websites use HX now a good example
on reddit is to vote and click that vote
it doesn't reload the whole page or
submit a form it just sends that vote to
the server and then the server records
it so these are some technologies that
be good for you guys to learn and you
can start making your web pages more
dynamic and look better and more
interactive so there's one last thing
we're going to do in this this unit
which is we're going to talk to you'd
ask CD about how they use Google App
Engine in production so you can get a
sense for troubles they've encountered
in some of the solutions they found
running a large production site like
Google App Engine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
