standard deviation and to do that let's
think back to our example with stores
and sales and let's say the question we
want to answer is is there any
correlation between the day of the week
and how much money people spend on
various items and what's interesting
about this design pattern is that all
the mapper has to do is output the day
of the week as a key so maybe Monday and
the value of a sale maybe $5 20 cents as
a value that's it what does that leave
for the reducer well it leaves all the
math for the reducer and the general
reason for this rule of thumb for what
the mapper and reducer doing comes from
the fact that oftentimes with these with
these summary statistics you sort of
need to know all of the statistics or
all of the parent data before you can
make any calculations so we don't want
to jump the gun and have the mapper do
calculations before it's ready so when
you go ahead and calculate the mean and
standard deviation for sales for each
day of the week to help us try to answer
this question if there's any correlation
between the day of the week and how much
people spend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
