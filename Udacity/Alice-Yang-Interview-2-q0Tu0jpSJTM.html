variables and data types in this lesson
particularly about integers and strings
are there examples in the apps that
you've worked on of these things hmm oh
yes there are plenty
so strings are integers are everywhere
in Gmail for example when you're first
over your email it tells you how many
unread messages that you have so that's
a very very important number and we
actually have these very subtle bugs
that's the one number might not match
exactly how many unread messages you
have so I've never encountered that have
you that's good how did it so um yeah
but these are you know it's an
interesting problem to solve because for
team hugs
we actually sink that number first like
sync means like I'm fetching my data
from the cloud into my Android device so
that data is actually that number is
synced separately from your actually
email so if they could potentially go
not of sync and that's one of the very
trickier issues oh okay so we've
established that the number of unread
emails is a variable its data type would
be it will be an instant it would be an
integer and its value is being
calculated across devices and its value
is changing based on the use case of the
scenario a user is experiencing yes
exactly and another use of integer so
that's an example of a variable integer
basically you could change
another example is IDs so fried es is
actually very important that the integer
stays the same so my email ID
particularly exactly so the email ID on
the server that represents that email
needs to be exactly the same as the ID
that's on the client because that's the
way we uniquely identify this email
everywhere it must all your devices so
this is it for a conversation yes not
like a email address yes for a
conversation so for Gmail for example
the whole thread so the email thread
which has multiple messages and it's the
whole thread we call conversation that
was a conversation ID which message
itself also has its own unique ID okay
and each one of these IDs is stored in a
variable whose data type is
integer again okay yes how many emails
are going out in a day do you know this
is a lot of yes I do
I do not know I'd imagine that if each
message in a conversation is unique and
each email is unique across all emails
that are going yes this is not to be a
very logical right so that's a very good
question so instead of it into actually
for these we use Long's okay so I said
because it's 64-bit okay so then we will
never so long just gives you more space
to hold a larger number that's really
the difference between
intan long okay how about any strings
strings
I'd imagine is subject a string at all
or how is that snore yeah everything
yeah subject is a string itself okay and
obviously email addresses are strings so
that's another very important and almost
everything that you see in any app like
visually everything that has texts would
be yes and and I think a good engineer
you don't have to know everything but
you really you have to be good at like
figure out like know where the answer
you can probably look for there's a lot
of good tutorials out there for just
have to know how to look for the right
keywords search with the right keywords
and you also ask people for help oh yes
that is actually very important I think
almost always I regret not asking people
earlier you know I could like try to fix
something for like a whole day and at
the end of the day decide okay maybe I
should have asked whoever wrote this
component so yeah like I think reaching
out to people early is it's definitely
valuable can say very valuable time and
also just be more aware of what other
projects are going on at Google I think
the or you know at your own around you I
think the really good engineer is there
did not only focus on what they're doing
but you know they they we have these
things called Tech Talks mmm at work so
which are available publicly for people
to view at least some of them yeah some
of them are yes so they're often know
what the latest tech know
are you know from these tech talks or
announcements that are you know sent to
the entire engineering org so just yes
just being on top of ah and let's go
back to the time when you were actually
learning to program if you could talk to
the Alice at that time what advice would
you give her today well that's a very
interesting question um I feel like I
should have had more fun with
programming hmm so um I think the way I
learned to program and I think it's very
different now because I grew up in I
originally I'm from China so I think it
was very academically focused like you
know I went to these extracurricular you
know classes that like taught by a
teacher and then you know we get
assignments like you know you do learn
this algorithm and then you know to
solve this problem so and I think I
looking back I wish I had like done more
projects are just like fun type projects
and I think would you make a birthday up
I will yeah like exactly like you know
these type of apps that I could have I
think I could learn a lot more because
it's not just about you know oh there's
this one right answer but in like doing
an app like that I can learn like about
design if it's a birthday app I'll learn
about you know different UI components
it's not just about you know okay you
need to send this data from here to here
and then you know solve it more
efficiently and it's yeah I think it
would and I think in real life that is
what you know engineering is more about
it's about you know not just solving a
technical challenge but also creating a
great product
yeah sort of like being driven by your
own curiosity yes yes well captain and I
want to thank you for your time everyone
I think our students will benefit a lot
from your perspective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
