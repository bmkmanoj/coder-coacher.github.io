charge very similar to the conservation
of energy conservation of charge means
that the total charge in the universe
never changes now this doesn't mean it's
impossible to let's say create a
positive church it just means that when
we do create a positive charge we better
create a negative charge to go along
with it in fact we can refine this
definition let's make it a little more
specific let's say that the total charge
in a closed system never changes well
what does this mean with a closed system
well for the purpose of conservation of
charge a closed system means that
there's no charge being added to or
removed from the system
for example let's imagine a metallic
sphere this would be in this case a
closed system nothing is touching it
it's just hanging out somehow and
there's no charge being introduced to it
and no charge being removed from it now
in reality this spirit had to be held by
something so let's say is held by some
stand and the only important thing is
that this stand be what's called an
insulator an insulator is something
which doesn't allow charges to move
around inside of it but we'll get to
that in a bit now this metallic sphere
just like the human body is made of
atoms and those atoms contain positive
protons and negative electrons and let
me get rid of some of this stuff so we
can focus on the problem at hand so we
mentioned before that our stand has to
be an insulator something in which
charges are stuck and can't move the
other end of the spectrum is a conductor
in which electrons are free to move now
in the case of our conducting sphere of
course the sphere is a conductor and the
positive and negative charges in this
neutral conductor are perfectly balanced
I've drawn seven in reality there'd be
trillions and trillions but what I want
to know is let's say we were somehow
able to find a positively charged object
this has a net positive charge and we
could bring it close to this conducting
sphere can you think about this problem
and tell me what will the charge
distribution in this sphere look like
when we bring this charge close so which
of these pictures best indicates what
the charge distribution in this sphere
will look like once we've brought a
positive charge close to the right hand
side now you have to think about this
for a minute think of what it means to
be a conductor think of what sorts of
charges are attracted and repelled and I
think you can probably get this one
right good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
