how to do some basic arithmetic
operations like using the plus sign to
add two numbers together for example if
we had this statement integer X equals 2
plus 3 that would do this calculation
over here and would calculate 5 and then
store 5 into our variable X for
subtraction would use the minus sign
like for example integer y equals 4
minus 5 integers can also store negative
numbers so this will actually store the
negative 1 value inside Y you can even
write negative numbers directly like
integer temp equals negative 20 this
will store the value negative 20 into
the variable temp for multiplication you
can use this asterisk sign that's
usually shift 8 on your keyboard so this
would multiply 7 by 4 and store the
value 28 in the variable days and to
divide numbers we use this forward slash
sign like this double diff equals 5/2
which would result in 22.5 however even
though we're storing the result in a
double variable here because we're
dividing two integers 5 &amp;amp; 2 the result
also would become an integer throwing
away that fractional part and only
storing the value 2 into our variable
div but if you want to calculate the
accurate division result you have to
make sure that at least one of those two
numbers is a double itself like for
example this double accurate equals 5
divided by 2 point 0 which is the exact
same value as this except that 2.0 now
forces this division to result in a
double value and store that into our
variable accurate this would happen with
any division that has only two integers
in it like 24 divided by 5 even though
that would result in 4.8 it will just
throw away that fractional part and only
store the value 4 into the variability
of to notice that it's not approximating
it to the nearest integer it's just
throwing away that fractional part so if
you want the actual division of 24
divided by 5 then just make sure that at
least one of those two numbers is a
double like 5.0 and that would store the
value for point 8 into our variable
accurate to here we will talk a little
bit more about this when we get to the
costing very soon all these operations
can also be applied to variables
themselves like if we had this setup for
exam
people where X is equal to two plus
three which evaluates to five and y is
equal to four minus five which evaluates
to negative one so X has the value five
in it and Y has the value negative one
now we can actually multiply those two
variables x and y and store the result
in Z what this would do is it would
multiply the values stored inside that
two variables and put the result of that
multiplication into the variable Z
storing the value negative five into the
variable Z we can even combine more and
more earth medications into one
statement for example if I wanted to
calculate the amount of tip I should
leave based on the amount that I've paid
and the change I got back I could just
subtract change from the amount paid and
multiply that entire result by 0.2 which
is 20% notice how I've used this set of
parentheses around there subtraction
here before I do the multiplication this
is to force the computer to apply this
subtraction before it does the
multiplication over the result of that
subtraction so in this case what would
happen is paid minus change would
calculate the value of six point seven
five and then that result will get
multiplied by 0.2 which would value
eight to one point three five and that
will get stored in the variable tip so I
know I have to pay one point thirty five
dollars tip but if I didn't have those
set of parentheses computers always
prioritize multiplications and divisions
over additions and subtractions which
means once it sees a statement like this
it would perform that multiplication
part before it performs a subtraction
calculating the value of 0.65 and then
subtracting that from ten giving the
result of 9.35 that is a big tip so
remember to always use those set of
parentheses when you want your Earth
make operations to perform in a certain
order because computers always try to
perform multiplications and divisions
before it tries to do any additions or
subtractions so if in doubt always
surround your operations with
parentheses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
