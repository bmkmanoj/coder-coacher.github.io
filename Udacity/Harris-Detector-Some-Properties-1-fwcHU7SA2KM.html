properties of the Harris detector one of
the bigger question is can we actually
build these types of detectors that
invariant to rotation that basically
means is let's say if I have one image
and I have another image and in this
image basically let's say I have a you
know something like a plus sign here I
want to be able to detect the features
of this even though in this image this
plus sign might be rotated a bit alright
so being able to deal with rotation
invariance is an important part because
I still want to find the same corners
now a simple example like this but you
can actually see that this can get to be
very complicated depending on objects
and of course I sometimes want to be
able to find objects even with you know
variations across the board on lighting
and stuff like that so that's the next
part
can we actually also find edges if there
is variance and image intensity so again
I might have two images and these could
be two pairs next to each other this one
is much brighter and this one is much
darker we saw examples of that when we
looked at the image pairs of the toy
giraffe for example third part that we
actually also be invariant to is image
scale but basically that means is I have
a image and I have an object that is
here and it is of this scale but on the
second image and I have the same object
but it is in this case much bigger so
how do we kind of deal with the fact
that the same object might be occurring
in an image pair but appear to be very
large so in essence now we need to start
seeing does the harris detector provide
support for these types of invariances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
