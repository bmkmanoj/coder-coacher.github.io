one doesn't make sense since there's
nothing to match k us against this is
what the sir ticket is protecting its
ensuring that the client learns the
right public key for the server the
second one is our goal that we want to
know that the certificate matches the
domain that we're connecting with and
then we can trust that that's actually a
public key associated with that domain
the other two could possibly work but
they would require an extra round of
communication they'd require the
certificate authority being online and
if we could obtain the key directly from
the certificate authority but we
wouldn't need this step we talk to them
in the first place the appeal of sending
the certificate is we don't need the
certificate authority to be online or
add an extra communication to another
place when we connect to the server the
server can store its own certificate and
send it to clients when they need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
