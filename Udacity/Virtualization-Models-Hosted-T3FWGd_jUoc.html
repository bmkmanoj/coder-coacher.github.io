model in this model at the lowest level
there is a full-fledged host operating
system that manages all of the hardware
resources the host OS integrates a
virtual machine monitor module that's
responsible for providing the virtual
machines with their virtual platform
interface and for managing all of the
context which is scheduling etc as
necessary this vmm module will invoke
drivers or other components of the host
operating system as needed this one
benefit of this model is that it can
leverage all of the services and
mechanisms that are already developed
for the host operating system much less
functionality needs to be redeveloped
for the VMM module in this manner also
note that on this host operating system
you may run gasps VMs through the
virtual machine module but you can also
run native applications directly on the
host operating system as you would in
general one example of the hosted model
is KVM which stands for kernel based vm
that's based on the Linux operating
system the Linux host provides all
aspects of the physical Hardware
management and just like any regular OS
it can run directly regular Linux
applications the support for running
guest virtual machines is the
combination of a kernel module that's
the cavea module in the hardware
emulator called qmu we said that the
goal of virtualization is to provide
identical hardware so here this emulator
is used as virtualizer so it really
matches the underlying hardware
resources the x86 Intel or AMD the
support for running guest VMs in KVM is
the combination of a kernel module KVM
in a hardware emulator qmu and we said
that virtualization the intent is to
provide identical hardware so this qmu
emulator isn't emulating some bizarre
hardware platform instead it's used in
what's called a virtualizer mode so the
resources that are available to the
guest VM are actually the
exact hardware resources from the
physical platform except that this
virtualizer intervenes during certain
types of critical operation certain
specific instructions or when it needs
to pass control to the Octavia module in
the host LS one example of that would be
any aspect of i/o management because all
of the support for devices the device
drivers are he involved as part of the
Linux operating system the host of us a
huge benefit for KVM has been that it's
able to really leverage all of the
advances that are continuously being
contributed to the large Linux
open-source community because of this
KVM can quickly adapt to new hardware
features new devices new security bugs
or similar things in fact the KVM module
was originally developed as a Linux
module in order to allow regular user
Linux applications to take advantage of
some of the virtualization related
hardware that started appearing in
commodity platforms all of a sudden
users realize that this can be useful to
actually run guest operating systems and
regular virtual machines and so three
months later key VM was an actual
virtualization solution that was part of
the mainstream Linux kernel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
