measures I can think of at least six or
seven right now but most of them fall
under two main groups two families if
you will the first we call difference
measures the easiest difference measures
one we've already talked about the mean
difference the next type are called
standardized differences and there are
several different types of standardized
difference measures but we'll focus on
one and that measures called Cohen's D
this is the standardized difference
measure we're going to use throughout
the rest of this course notice that
Cohen's D as a standardized difference
measure actually tells us about the mean
difference it does so in standard
deviation units the next family are
called correlation measures there are
again several different correlation
measures as with standardized mean
differences we're gonna focus on one
which is called R squared R squared
tells us the proportion or percentage a
variation in one variable in other words
change in one variable that is related
to another variable and sometimes we say
instead of related to we say explained
by what we mean explained by is that we
can explain a certain percentage or
proportion of variation or change in one
variable by knowing the value of the
other variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
