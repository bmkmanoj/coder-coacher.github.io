surface we can apply a texture to
represent the world itself in the
distance or clouds in all directions the
way the solution is done is with a
skybox the idea is to put the viewer in
the center of a box and put the
environment on the walls floor and
ceiling doing this reminds me a bit of
the truman show where Truman's world is
highly limited and you runs this ship
into well I don't want to spoil anything
if you haven't seen it the key is that
you have to be careful to not let the
viewer get too close to the sky so that
he doesn't figure out it's just an
illusion if I turn on the wire frame for
the cube the trick is revealed you can
see the walls of the box without the
wireframe the illusion is seamless if
the viewer moves around the center of
the box moves with them in this way
there is no distortion as the view of
the walls never changes this type of
texture is called a cube map it's made
of six images that form the cube faces
the viewer is always placed at the
center of the cube for example here's
the frustum for the top of the cube the
plus y face the cube shape is not
required it's possible to have other
geometry such as a hemispherical dome
around the scene whatever the shape our
eyes can't see the z-buffer so can't
tell the sky is only say 100 meters away
sky boxes are typically used for star
fields or well the sky for times when
you're not near the ground alternately
you can simply make the surrounding
skybox a part of the scene such as shown
here real geometry has the advantage
that it can receive shadows from the
object the main rule is that you want to
make sure that nothing pokes through the
walls of the Sky box itself oh and one
more thing you definitely want to set
the far distance of your camera so that
it encompasses the Sky box itself
otherwise it'll be clipped out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
