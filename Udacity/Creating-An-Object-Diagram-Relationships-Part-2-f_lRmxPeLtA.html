to our diagram and that's something to
represent the idea of multiplicity in
object diagrams multiplicity is just a
fancy word for the number of objects
represented in a relationship this is
another one of those things that we're
borrowing from UML now multiplicity it
goes hand in hand with the contains
relationships if we look back at the
world object let's ask ourselves some
how many questions for example how many
actors are in the world or how many
backgrounds are in a world we might say
for every world we have what looks like
it could be many actors or for every
world we might have one background and
conventionally we use terms like one too
many or many too many or even many too
one to represent this multiplicity so
right now if we think about the actors
we can see that there's two actors on
the screen but there could be more or
there could be worlds where there's no
actors at all to be honest we don't
really know so we could do two things
here since we already have the app built
we could play around with it some more
and find out what are all the different
cases for the number of actors in a
world or for what would be the case if
we're designing this from scratch and we
didn't have the app already we could
just make a decision and go with it for
instance we could say for any given
world there may be one too many actors
we don't know how many there could be a
lot there could be a little doesn't
really matter we could limit it we could
say for any one world there's only ever
going to be two actors but I have a
little bit of an advantage because I
already know that there could be one too
many actors in a world and if we go back
to our diagram we can add the
multiplicity two this contains
relationship for actors and if we read
the multiplicity from left to right it
follows the same order as our arrow so
for every one world we have we can have
many actors now let's look at another
example this one will be for the
contains relationship for the background
from what we saw there's only one
background for the world so that means
this relationship is one-to-one for
every one world object there's one
background the use of the one-to-many
and the one to one this is another thing
that we're taking from UML
so again this is kind of a blend of both
a formal and an informal process there's
something else that I want to point out
and that is that the relationships
themselves and even the multiplicity can
go in different directions and these
arrows could be bi-directional for
example right now the world contains one
too many actors but you may want an
arrow going from actor to world that
says for every one actor it could live
in many different worlds if it were the
case that in the game an actor might
show up in multiple different worlds
it's really up to you you could build
these diagrams however you want but
these are just some really popular
conventions and if you stick close to
these conventions then it makes it
easier for you to share your diagrams
with others it also makes it easier to
take this diagram and actually start
writing code and that's why there are
the formal processes liking UML in place
because it makes it easier to go from
something like UML to code or it
historically has there's one other key
takeaway that I want you to leave with
and that is that you should use a
process for creating object diagrams
that's the least restrictive to you
getting your work done I mean you could
spend an entire day or weeks designing
an object diagram but if it doesn't get
you any closer to an functioning app
then you might just be wasting your time
but there's also a great benefit of
having some kind of structure in mind
before you build it as a developer
you'll discover what works best for you
some people like to spend five minutes
on an object diagram others could spend
an entire week and another thing is if
you're working with a team a good object
diagram could be a great way for the
whole team to work together to
understand a really complex system all
right I'm going to go ahead and wrap
things up here but if you're interested
here's our final diagram for the alien
adventure so take some time to look at
it and maybe you have a better idea how
to organize things anyways I hope this
was helpful and I encourage you to reach
out to us or to your peers if you still
have questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
