architecture selected not one rule but
two so the soul theory this is called an
impasse and impasse occurs when the
decision-maker cannot make a decision
either because not enough knowledge is
available or because multiple causes of
action where are being selected and the
agent cannot decide among them in this
case two actions are being selected and
the agent cannot decide between them
should the pitcher threw a curveball or
a fastball at this point so we'll
attempt to learn a rule that might break
the impasse
if the decision-maker has a choice
between a fastball and a curveball and
cannot decide it might there be a way of
learning a rule that decides between
what to throw in a particular situation
given the choice of the fastball and
curveball for this now soar will invoke
his episodic knowledge let's see how so
does it and how it can help so learn the
rule that results in the breaking of the
impulse so imagine that soar had
episodic knowledge about the previous
event about a previous instance of an
event in this previous instance of an
event in another game it was a 5th
inning bottom of the fifth inning it
with the weather was windy it was the
same batter though Parra who bats
left-handed it was a similar kind of
situation and the pitcher threw a
fastball and Parra hit a home run out of
it now we won't avoid that the current
pitcher wants to avoid it so given this
episodic knowledge about this event that
occurred earlier sir has a learning
mechanism that allows it to encapsulate
knowledge from this event into the form
of a production rule that can be used as
part of the procedural knowledge and the
learned rulers if two operators have
suggested and throw a fastball is one of
those operators and the batter is para
then dismiss it throw fastball operator
this is the process of learning called
chunking so chunking is a process a
learning technique that soar users to
learn rules that can break impulse
first note that chunking is triggered
when impasse occurs in this situation
name passes the two rules code activated
and there is no way of resolving between
them so the impasse immediately tells
the process of chunking what the goal of
chunking is find a rule that can break
the impasse
so now searches 2d its episodic memory
and finds an event that has some
knowledge that may break the impasse in
particular it looks at the percepts of
the current situation that we had in
previous shot and compares to the
percepts of similar situations at the
event memory in the episodic memory and
finds that there is any information
available of the current batter if some
information is available at else or the
result of some previous action that also
occurs in the current impasse then so
picks that even so now he tries to
encapsulate the result of the previous
event in the form of a rule in this case
it wants to avoid the result of a
homeroom and therefore it says dismissed
that particular operator if we wanted
that particular result it would have
said throw that particular operator we
have said earlier that in cognitive
systems reasoning learning and memory
are closely connected here is an example
of that we're dealing with memory
procedural memory we're dealing with
memory that contains both procedural
knowledge and episodic knowledge dealing
with reasoning decision-making we are
also dealing with learning chunking if
you want to learn more about chunking
then the reading by layman layered and
rosenbloom and the further readings at
the end of this lesson
gives a lot many more details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
