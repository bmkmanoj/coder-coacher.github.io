prediction equation and a correction
equation our prediction basically takes
two components the estimate of our
previous step that is our belief about X
after time t minus one was done and then
we have a dynamics model right and the
way of thinking about this is the
likelihood the probability that X could
be of some specific point well it's the
sum or the integral of getting to that
point from any point that it might have
been before integrated over the
likelihood that you are at those points
before this is a lot easier to see when
we do the particle filtering where we
make things discreet but from the
probabilistically inclined for you if
you look at that you realize when we
talk about marginalizing what we're
doing is we're saying all of the
possibility of places we might have been
before what is the likelihood of you
getting to some particular spot and we
have to wait that by all of the
probabilities of having been at that
point before that's the likelihood of
being at that next spot and then you go
to the next spot in the next time that's
the probability that's your prior belief
your pre of your prediction about the
places you might end up p of xt given
the measurements up until now we don't
have the measurement yet once we get a
measurement we can do a correction right
in our correction we use doing Bayes
rule right we have the predicted value
from before that's the the quantity we
just talked about producing and then we
have an observation model this
observation models as well if you really
were at some particular point what's the
likelihood of getting the measurement
you just saw and by using Bayes rule
we're allowed we use that to turn that
into a prediction of xt given everything
we saw including that's why it's in red
the new measurement and then like I said
on the bottom here is just the the
normalization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
