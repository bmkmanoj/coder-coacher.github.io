this course is not about the course is
not an introduction to networking so
there are a number of basic topics that
won't be covered in this course in
particular we'll assume that you're
already familiar with the basics of
things like TCP socket programming and
so forth anything that you might have
picked up in an introductory networking
course we are just going to assume as a
prerequisite for this course so before
you proceed it may be worth revisiting
some of your old undergraduate
networking course material the course is
also not providing any introduction to
programming however many assignments in
the course will make use of some amount
of programming so some knowledge of
scripting languages like Ruby Python or
Perl will certainly be helpful in some
assignments we'll be making a lot of use
of a network emulation toolkit called
mini net and to use that tool most
effectively you will certainly want to
learn some Python if you don't already
know it don't worry if you don't know
these languages already though there's
plenty of time to learn in the course
since the deadlines are fairly spread
out and the assignments aren't focused
on knowledge of programming per se but
rather the concepts that you are going
to realize in the programming languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
