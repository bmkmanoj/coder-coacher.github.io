starts which is called blank count and
after that there is a two constants that
are being defined and pause the blank
the other one is the Sentinel and then
we moved to the main which is actually
the main the main body of the class and
also the main method for the program
everything is included into a try-catch
block and the first instruction is
actually to initialize that
inputstreamreader is art with a new
inputstreamreader and that takes at the
system in a stream as a parameter I
believe on that line there's also a
problem because that violates code the
interfaces and rather than
implementation so they actually had the
implementation class on the left left
hand side should be declared as the app
as abstract interface and then the
concrete implementation on the
right-hand side but the new other people
agree yeah I'm going to mom's right ok
then there's the code declares two
integers next to end count and next is
going to be used as the next character
and the sentence and count is going to
be used to count the number of blank
characters which is the main goal of the
of this class I'm glad you start telling
us that they're semicolons only in this
joint that helps well I think it's
important to strengthen so before the
semicolon so shouldn't we initialize
these values like we have the ice are
very and we sure didn't elbows and there
you should we decide whether it's a
character or an int the comments as
character the generation says in it yeah
well that's that's excellent big data
yeah that's a comment from again I did
you done sly star maybe you wouldn't
written it right the first time should
should we go for comments on the right
side of the or should we put them above
you get their own line maybe it'd help
us read it better I don't have this is
going back to line four up above I don't
not quite sure when we when we want them
beside the code well there was nothing
in this standard that we use in the
company but that's finally if we want to
because i know we
we could make a stance right we can make
his language just you know right now by
that standard yeah fine mm-hmm what's so
what's the standard we're gonna go slosh
slosh all the way our / door / star
seems a little more robust we can you
know you don't have to use as many /
lashes javadoc she is a slash star kind
of that kind of structure when you do
thought it was kind of old-fashioned but
that's okay we can use Roman fashion
okay doctor about continuity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
