go through the steps next the third
choice is clearly useless since it's
still in terms of P and Q and it's also
incorrect the second choice would be
useful if it was correct but it's just
not correct so the hint was to try
squaring P minus Q so we get this and PQ
here is equal to n so we can simplify
this to P squared plus Q squared minus
2n we've still got these terms of P
squared and Q squared if we want to get
an equation all in terms of n we need to
get rid of those but we also know what P
plus Q is so let's try squaring that and
when we square P plus Q we get P squared
plus 2pq plus q squared which
substituting the end for PQ is equal to
P squared plus Q squared plus 2n so this
looks good if we subtract these two we
get rid of the P squares in the Q
Squared's now remember our goal is to
get an equation that doesn't involve PRQ
but we have this property from the
totient that we know what P plus Q is in
terms of just n so we're going to
substitute that in then we can just take
the square root which is how we ended up
with this equation here which was the
answer to the quiz so now we know the
value of P plus Q in terms of an
equation only using N and we can add
these to get the value of 2p and divide
that by to get the value of P and once
we have the value of P we've factored in
because we can divide n by P easily get
the value of Q so our nice little box
here turns into our proof is finished
and I should emphasize that there's no
difficult computation to do here we're
doing subtraction and squaring and
multiplication but just the square root
is a discreet square root but discrete
square roots are not difficult and we
know that this result will be an integer
because the value of P must be an
integer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
