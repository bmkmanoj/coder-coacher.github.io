extensibility now we will look at
exokernel approach to operating system
extensibility the name exokernel itself
comes from the fact that the kernel
exposes hardware explicitly to the
operating system extensions living above
it the basic idea and exokernel is to
decouple authorization of the hardware
from its actual use let's say you want
to do research in my lab I mean
interview you and once we're on the same
page I'll give you a key to the lab and
the resources you need in order to do
work in the lab mmm example laptop
servers and so on
then I get out of the way when you
actually use the resources that's
exactly the same idea in exokernel
library operating system asks for a
resource exokernel will validate the
request for the resource from the
library and bind the request to the
specific hardware resource in other
words exokernel exposes the hardware
that was requested by the library OS
through creating a secure binding
between the ask and the actual hardware
resource once exokernel has established
this binding it creates an encrypted key
for the resource and gives it to the
requesting library operating system
similar to the analogy that I gave you
of a student using my lab resources the
semantics of how the resource is going
to be used by the library is entirely up
to the library of course within the norm
of accepted use similar to what I may
impose as certain restrictions or rules
of behavior that students have to
observe in the lab same way there are
certain accepted norms for the use of
the resource that exokernel may have
imposed and so long as the library
operating system is staying within those
nor
then the semantics of how a particular
hardware ethos is used is entirely up to
the library operating system once a
library operating system has asked for a
resource and exokernel
has created the binding for that
resource to the requesting library
operating system then the operating
system is now ready to use the resource
now how does it use the resource
basically what the library operating
system will do is present the encrypted
key that it received authenticating that
use of the resource for this library to
the exokernel in other words exokernel
will be able to validate whether the key
presented to it is the key that was
presented to this particular library's
operating system so in other words the
key cannot be forged cannot be passed
around if I gave a key to this library
operating system that key if it is
presented to the exokernel by this
library operating system it's a valid
key even if it is a valid key but it is
not the operating system to which
exokernel gave the key then that request
will be denied so with a valid key
anytime the library operating system can
present the key to the exokernel
exokernel are validated and then the
library operating system is free to go
in using that resource for which it has
this valid key this is sort of like a
doorman in an apartment building
checking when a resident comes in
whether the resident of the bonafide the
occupant of the residence
once inside his apartment what the
resident does is not something that the
doorman cares about exactly the same
thing is being done by exokernel as a
doorman for using the hardware resource
for which a valid key exists with a
library operating system so establishing
the secure binding is a heavy duty
operation that's where exokernel comes
in the middle of saying well this
particular library operating system
wants access to a specific resource can
I give it and it makes the decision
once such a secure binding has been
established the actual use of the
hardware is going to be much cheaper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
