visualization using color we can
typically encode values with color in
two different ways hue and saturation
they can be used individually or in
combination color hue is what we
typically refer to as color like red or
green or blue different colors used
together usually indicate categorical
data where each color represents a
different group so if we were using our
baseball data maybe green as shortstops
red is outfielders and orange is second
baseman something like that saturation
is the intensity of color for a given
hue so if your selected color was blue
high saturation would be very blue and
the color would look faded as you
decrease your saturation we usually use
saturation to encode intensity or
quantity of a value so maybe if we were
encoding number of home runs with
saturation more homeruns would be darker
and fewer homeruns would be lighter or
if we were encoding odd whore
enrollments more enrollments would be
darker and fewer enrollments would be
lighter we could also use hue and
saturation in combination so you can see
here that no human know saturation is
set to zero and in this particular
encoding the more saturated our purple
light color is the more negative we are
and the more saturated our green light
color is the more positive we are this
might accentuate the differences in
value and tell us when the value is
positive or negative and how intense the
absolute value of that effect is when
using color to encode information a
pretty good general rule of thumb is
that you shouldn't use more than a dozen
colors to encode categories effectively
if you were to use more than twelve
colors it might be hard to quickly
differentiate between categories and
your visualization is going to become a
little bit harder to parse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
