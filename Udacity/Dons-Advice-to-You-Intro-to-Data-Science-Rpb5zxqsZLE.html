that you create is in a very large part
determined by essentially what are you
paying attention to about your data so
this is the problem called feature
selection and I think that not enough
time is spent in doing this it's very
very important so it's in a lot of data
science shops it's very easy to just
sort of take records that come in and
then put them into logistic regression
and you get some output and then like
you can call it a day and you know maybe
oftentimes that could be enough to take
you like you know fifty percent of the
way there but really the difference
between like between like mediocre and
like a top-notch shop is like you have
SAT and thought about what are the
things to pay attention to like should I
synthesize these features into a new
feature is there something new about
this phenomenon that I should be
capturing but haven't yet haven't yet
captured so there's a lot of sort of
there's a lot of process that goes into
just the feature selection process which
is is hugely important more advice we're
just occurred to me is there's an
additional there's a world of tools out
there that is not merely limited so so
everything that you would learned in the
machine learning class is fantastic it
forms a great foundation beyond there
there's a wealth of mathematical tools
and the more of them that you know the
more that it will help you so things for
example like differential equations or
stochastic processes such as Markov
chains knowledge of these things allow
you to break down a problem that you
know nothing about you can sort of break
it down a little bit a little bit
further into pieces that give you just
that extra bit of predictive ability or
or insight into a problem and the more
tools that you have at your disposal the
more it will help you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
