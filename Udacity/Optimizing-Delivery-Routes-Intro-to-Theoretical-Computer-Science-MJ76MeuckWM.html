just like Alice Bob and Carol and he is
working in logistics and the problem
that he's working on is optimizing the
delivery routes for the mail trucks of
his company so basically the problem
that Dave has to solve each day is the
following here's the headquarter of his
company where each day the mail arrives
so maybe the mail arrives by an airplane
and that airplane delivers letters each
day and then this delivery truck here
has to deliver those letters to all of
the houses that receive mail that day so
let's say it's those seven houses here
where this truck has to deliver the mail
and of course the roads that connect the
houses so not every house is connected
to each other house directly and the
roads also have different lengths and
I'm going to specify this in minutes so
if I write a for T here it means you
need 40 minutes to get from this house
to this house and then 14 from this
house to this house and 13 from this
house to this house and so on so you can
already see that this looks very much
like a graph except that the edges now
have a certain distance or time attached
to them now the problem that Dave has to
solve is a problem that we will call
shortest tour we will say that as an
optimization problem for now we'll later
work with the decision problem to show
NP completeness of this problem the
truck starts out here at the
headquarters and then Dave is supposed
to figure out the fastest way for the
truck to visit all houses and then get
back to the base so it starts out here
has to visit all houses it can visit a
house more than once in case you're
wondering and then it has to get back to
base so let's say the truck starts out
here and let's say the first road it
takes down is this one here what I would
like you to tell me is in which order
should the truck visit the other houses
so this is the first house that the
truck is visiting and I want you to
enter a two three four five six and
seven here so if the truck travels from
house 1 to house 2 then to house 3 and
so on it's taking the fastest possible
route to visit all houses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
