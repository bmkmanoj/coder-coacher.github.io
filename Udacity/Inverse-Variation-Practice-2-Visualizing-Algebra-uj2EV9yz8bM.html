foot candle fantastic work for figuring
that one out we want to start by setting
up our proportion using inverse
variation we know the intensity of light
varies inversely as the square of the
distance this means that for intensity
one the distance one it needs to be
squared in the denominator we flip the
second fraction now I think it's really
easy to make a mistake when plugging in
these amounts so I would make a list of
the amounts and then right in the
numbers or variables like a with them we
know intensity one is two foot candles
and that's at a distance of five feet
away so intensity one is two foot
candles and the distance one is five
feet we're looking for the second
intensity we don't know it so we use X
and this intensity occurs at 20 feet
from the light source so we have 20 feet
for our second distance we can use this
list to help us plug in the values to
get this proportion will leave two
divided by X here and then we'll have
400 / 25 here we cross multiply to get
50 equals 400 x and then we divide both
sides by 400 to get x is equal to 18 18
is this equivalent fraction we simply
divide each number by 50 we saw for an
intensity of light so we want to make
sure we put the correct unit it was 18
foot candles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
