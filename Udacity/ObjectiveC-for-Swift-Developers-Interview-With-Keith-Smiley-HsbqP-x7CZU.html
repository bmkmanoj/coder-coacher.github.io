engineer at left I work on our iOS
platform team so I work on a lot of the
infrastructure and architecture of the
iOS app we decided to rewrite the lift
up in Swift for a lot of reasons one of
which was them as a team we were
extremely excited about the future of
iOS development with Swift and another
big portion was the codebase that we
were working in that existed from the
beginning lyft wasn't the best as we
continued scaling the team it worked
really well to you know get lift off the
ground and to where it was when I joined
but we it became immediately apparent as
our team grew from you know three to ten
people that it wasn't gonna be
productive for us to work day to day in
the codebase so that was a huge portion
of it I think making the decision to do
a swift rewrite is is definitely a big
thing that you really have to consider a
lot of angles because it can be
extremely risky for the company you know
if your app is already you know a
hundred thousand lines of code and
objective-c or something just deciding
to rewrite it isn't like the easiest
thing to to do so you know we were
extremely lucky to get off the ground
and like be successful with the rewrite
whereas you know a lot of times when you
hear about all-out rewrites you hear
about them and more of a negative light
and I think that it was just extremely
lucky that ours worked out the way that
it did I don't think there were too many
specific features that they gave us a
lot of trouble you know whenever we had
to Interop with a some third-party
objective-c library we ran into some
issues there in the early days but you
know we weren't really using the old
implementation as kind of
Frantz implementation for the rewrite so
we kind of lean on our QA team a lot to
be able to tell us how something should
work as opposed to just looking at the
old code and trying to reason about it
which i think helps a lot so we were
kind of instead of looking at how was
and just redoing it in the same way we
were totally rethinking how it was
written the first time and how we could
rewrite it now to be better since we
knew more about the problems today the
benefits of rewriting our app in Swift
were pretty massive our app is 100%
Swift we have no first party objective-c
code although of course we do rely on a
lot of third-party libraries that are
still written in objective-c some of the
issues that we've ran into with the
third-party code has mostly been because
the third-party libraries haven't been
annotated for you know whether a type is
optional or not when it's being imported
into Swift and because of that you know
if we guessed wrong about whether it was
optional or not the app could crash at
runtime so you know instead when we run
into those cases we kind of treat
everything is optional and just have to
deal with that in Swift but at least we
know we're not going to crash I think
that the community is doing a great job
of convincing the objective-c developers
to add knowability annotations to their
libraries mainly because Swift has
become so pervasive that people keep
asking for it on all these popular
libraries that were originally written
in objective-c
I pretty rarely find myself reading and
writing objective-c definitely reading
it more than writing it you know of
course lots of stuff like historical
Stack Overflow questions and stuff like
that is still all written in objective-c
and you know like I said we do depend on
a lot of third-party libraries that are
written in objective-c and often we need
to dive into them to try to find the
source of a bug I don't really miss
anything about objective-c I didn't
absolutely hate it before so if it came
around but once you really work on an
all Swift app like ours where you can
use all the Swift features as soon as
they're released without having to worry
about in Rafah shoes it's really freeing
I think it's gonna be a long time before
Swift entirely replaces objective-c you
know mainly because there's so much
objective-c code out there already
not only third-party apps but also like
all of the third party or the first
party like the iOS SDK itself or you
know all of iOS presumably is written in
objective-c as well so I think that even
even if the third-party developers all
switch to only using Swift Apple's gonna
have to continue maintaining objective-c
for a long time just for their own use
when we're hiring a developer for the
lift iOS team I think one of the most
important things is your collaboration
skills whether or not we think that we'd
be able to work with you day to day on a
feature another big thing that you know
I don't think always comes up in the iOS
community is a general like acumen for
software engineering I'm not
particularly like how do you write
different sorting algorithms from
scratch or something but at least you
know being able to think about
high-level architecture of problems so
that when you you know go to implemented
a feature you can identify places that
need to be improved or rewritten
entirely you know depending on the case
when we're hiring developers to work on
our entirely Swift app we kind of expect
them to have some background in
objective-c
just because that's been the norm up to
now but that's not a huge requirement
for us anymore like as long as you have
a very good understanding of the iOS SDK
in general and then you know some of the
gotchas around the platform you know
such as memory management which was more
painfully obvious in objective-c than it
is in Swift then you totally have the
skills to be productive on our team I
think for developers who are starting
the iOS community having only really
written Swift it is still important to
least spend some time knowing that you
can read Objective C if you need to
become at least familiar with the syntax
you know and once once you've learned
Swift in the iOS SDK in general it
should be pretty easy to pick up within
some amount of time and hopefully you
can find a position where you don't have
to write it full time but you know with
many companies now that's not entirely
the case because lots of companies have
you know some Swift and some Objective C
so it might still be useful to to be
able to write it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
