talking about requirements is that
between user and system requirements so
let's start by defining user
requirements those are requirements that
are written for the customers and
they're often in natural language and
don't contain technical details and the
reason for that is that their purpose is
to allow customers stakeholders to check
that the system will do what they
intended so it's a way for the analyst
the developers to communicate with the
customers with the stakeholders system
requirements on the other hand are
written for developers contain detailed
functional and non-functional
requirements which we just discussed and
are clearly and more rigorously
specified than the user requirements and
the reason for this difference is that
the purpose of the system requirements
is to tell developers what to build
they must contain enough details so that
developers can take them and use them to
design and then develop a system just to
give you a concrete example here I'm
showing you a user requirement that just
says that the software must provide a
means of representing and accessing
external files created by other tools
and the corresponding system requirement
and as you can see even if we don't read
the whole requirements the former is an
informal and high-level description of a
piece of functionality where's the
letter describes the same functionality
but in a much more extensive and
rigorous way so as I said this is
something that the developers can use to
design and then build a system whereas
this is something that can be used to
communicate with the stakeholders with
the non-technical audience and we need
to define both because they serve
different purposes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
