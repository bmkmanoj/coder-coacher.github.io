our new kind of level of existing which
is like the Google App Engine / Heroku
model which is completely managed you
don't even really think in the concept
of machines you just Google App Engine
you just upload your code you don't
think about OS you don't think about
anything you just give it a lot of
Python and they just run it they run
machines with the databases they do the
sharding they do the replication there's
basically zero sysadmin
which is a great way to get started and
depending on how you like to work on
your technical sophistication on the
complicate on the complexity of your
website you know this may work fine a
lot of big web sites have been built in
the system Udacity being one of them
runs on Google App Engine but it also
means when you want to customize things
it's very difficult to do things that
the providers of these services haven't
thought of ahead of time for you oh
that's kind of the continuum of setups
there's no penalty for choosing wrong
when you start because you can always
switch between it's not always easy and
we switch from colocation to AWS reddit
was a fairly large website at the time
so that was a little bit tricky we had
kind of two infrastructures slowly
migrated traffic from one to the other
at a very high level actually worked
okay
I'd suggest you can you feel like you've
outgrown Google App Engine or you want
to do something that App Engine won't
quite allow you to do take a look at
some of these other services and see if
they get the job done right and then
maybe I should get really really big you
hire dedicated system intz and maybe you
want to have your own machines because
it's a little bit cheaper and bandwidth
requirements are higher than what Amazon
can do for example or your storage
requirements or data needs you know you
need more and more more that's when you
start thinking about having your own
cage or having you on data center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
