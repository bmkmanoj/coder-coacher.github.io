first two years it'll be great if we
could find it even further along in time
let's work right now to find the balance
after three years actually you already
did this earlier but I'd like us to
write it in this kind of notation we
start with this amount since that's how
much money there is at the start of your
three and then the amount that we need
to add to this and interest is just this
quantity x 0.03 if we factor out this
quantity from both terms then we end up
once again with 1 + 0 point 0 3 inside
the second set of parentheses however
since we have 1 plus point 0 3 squared
here times that quantity again one plus
point 0 3 we can make this look more
compact by changing our exponent up here
instead of squared this is cubed this
time now that we have another quantity
continuing our pattern here what do you
think about the guests that you made
just before this do you want to keep it
as is or do you want to change it think
about what pattern you see think about
what you think the exponent in each of
these expressions means and then use
that information that pattern to write
down the balance in this form after four
years after 10 years and after 100 years
also give you another chance to write
down your hypothesis you can write in
exactly what you were before or you can
change it this time taking into account
the new information we have now once
again this part won't be graded we are
however going to see how your numbers
look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
