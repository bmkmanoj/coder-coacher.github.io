I'm gonna describe it as an analogy to
paint mixing and this analogy comes from
Simon Singh from the code book which is
a really fun book about the history of
cryptography so we have our usual
suspects Alice and Bob that want to
establish a shared key and they're gonna
do this by first picking a public color
let's say they both like yellow and
they'll start with cans of identical
yellow paints so both Alice and Bob
start with a can of yellow paint then
each party will pick at their own secret
color so let's say Alice picks a
greenish color and Bob picks a purplish
color then what they do is mix their
secret colors with the public color so
they're gonna mix those two and the
green and yellow will make some ugly
green color and Bob will do the same
thing mixing the yellow and purple to
get some new ugly color so at this stage
they exchange colors Alice gives Bob the
young ugly green color that she got by
mixing her secret color with yellow Bob
gives Alice the ugly pinkish color he
got by mixing yellow with his secret
color once they've received the other
party's colors they mix their secret
color with other parties mixed color at
this stage both parties should have the
same color so Alice mixed her green with
the pink that came from yellow and Bob's
secret color and that'll give some new
color probably uglier than the grey that
I'm drawing but Bob will get the same
thing because Bob is mixing the yellow
Alice's secret color and Bob's secret
color and getting the same color out so
this gets them the same color they've
mixed the same three colors together it
would be secure if someone who knew
yellow and could intercept these two
transmissions couldn't guess the secret
colors this assumes that paint unmixing
is impossible probably not a very good
assumption and certainly not a practical
way to actually do this what we want is
to do the same thing with mathematics
this is also the main operation we used
in symmetric ciphers XOR is plus mod
yellow - to do a key agreement though
plus is not going to be the main
operation the main operation will use is
multiplication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
