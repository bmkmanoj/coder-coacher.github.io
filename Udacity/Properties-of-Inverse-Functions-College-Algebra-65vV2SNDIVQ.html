statements to decide whether or not
they're each true so first things first
all functions have inverses well we know
that that's not true some functions like
y equals x squared don't pass the
horizontal line test so this doesn't
have an inverse we can't check this
first one often moving on to the second
one we have all inverse functions have
inverses this one is true if we start
off with one function and reflect it
across the line y equals x if we start
off with one function and then reflect
it across the line y equals x and end up
with another function then the second
function is the inverse of the first one
but if we reflect the second one back
across the line y equals x again we'll
end up with its inverse which is the
first one this is basically the same as
the property i showed you before if we
have a function f inverse that we know
is the inverse of F and then we take its
inverse that just equals the original
function f so yes to the second choice
now third we have a functions domain can
influence whether or not it has an
inverse this one is definitely true we
saw this with our parabola which we took
only portions of and saw that those
portions had inverses while the whole
parabola didn't and we also saw the same
thing with our absolute value function
fourth all functions pass the vertical
and horizontal line tests while all
functions pass the vertical line test
that's how we know that their functions
but not all of them pass the horizontal
line test so this isn't true the last
choice however is true all inverse
functions pass both the vertical and
horizontal line tests inverse functions
are functions so they pass the vertical
line test and since inverse functions
all have inverses as we already decided
that means they have to pass the
horizontal line test as well now I
personally think this was a really
really tough quiz this required you to
show some very in-depth understanding of
inverse functions and to think really
critically about all of these statements
awesome job on this quiz and on the
entire lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
