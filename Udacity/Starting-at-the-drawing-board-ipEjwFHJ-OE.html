started and you can't wait and you've
got nothing nada zilch Zippo I mean this
is your first app it has to be amazing
right I mean yes and no I mean your
first app is going to be amazing
obviously because you're building it but
it doesn't have to change the world it
doesn't have to be some groundbreaking
thing take that pressure off yourself
and keep some of these key principles in
mind when you're brainstorming for one
what I just said your first app doesn't
have to change the world you don't have
to think of some revolutionary amazing
thing that's gonna feed children and be
awesome just don't worry about to find
your motivation find something that
you're passionate about and you actually
want to work on because that's going to
make the process much much much easier
otherwise if you're working on something
that you're not so into you might just
stop halfway through because why
continue then keep it simple stupid the
simple kiss method don't think about a
ton of features and try to conclude
everything because you're just going to
probably end up with a clunky app that
nobody's going to be using then don't
worry if your idea already exists that
actually just means that there's a
market for it and you know people want
to use it most importantly this is your
first appt not your last so if it's not
your crowning achievement that's okay
because there are many iOS apps that you
will build in the future now you're
going to move forward and start
brainstorming some ideas for your app
now I would recommend that you always
keep a piece of paper or your phone or
some note taking app handy because you
never know when inspiration might strike
let's go think up some ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
