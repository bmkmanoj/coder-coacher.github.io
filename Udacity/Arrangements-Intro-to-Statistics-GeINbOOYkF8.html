over here is n factorial over n minus K
factorial and to see this let's go back
to the case where we had four heads in
the four heads case we multiplied all
the way to times five over here we only
multiplied all the way to seven these
are the four heads that we place so n
factorial goes from 10 all the way to 1
n minus K factorial goes from 10 minus 4
that's 6 all the way to 1 so this blue
expression over here will go from 10
times 9 times 8 and so on all the way to
1 over and now n minus K 10 minus 4 is 6
6 times 5 times 4 and so on when you
look at this is 6 times 5 times 4 across
on top as well so you can cut those out
and what remains is 10 times 9 times 8
times 7 this one over here
now once we place these 4 heads we have
to divide by 4 factorial which is a
different ways of placing those 4 points
into the predefined bins so put
differently this is K factorial so we
put all this together you get n
factorial over n minus K factorial times
K factorial this is the expression over
here as practices one last time say I
have a 25 coins and he asked how many
ways exists in which three coins come up
heads what is the resulting outcome be
careful when you use your calculator it
might result in an overflow but the
answer is easy to compute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
