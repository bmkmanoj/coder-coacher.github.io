DoD effort a
TC SEC or the orange book then with time
multiple countries sort of recognized
this importance of software procurement
they had to worry about security that
they can evaluate for those soft
products that evolved into what's called
the Common Criteria which is an
international standard Common Criteria
evolved or came from efforts you know in
Europe in Canada the US one that we
talked about the idea is that in a you
are consumer of a system or user of a
system you're going to specify what
needs you have or what requirements you
have when there's going to sort of
implement a solution and going to make
claims about that solution meeting your
needs or your requirements and in
particular we're talking about sort of
security requirements of security
properties so whoever is going to
evaluate it's going to determine whether
the vendor actually the claims that they
make are claims that you can believe and
these claims actually allow you to say
well my needs that I had specified are
met so so there's sort of three entities
you have some requirements a vendor who
provided the solution and makes a
certain of sort of claims how they meet
those requirements and somebody who
evaluates has to then assess those
claims and and and the reason we should
be able to trust whatever those claims
are about based on that we're going to
give it an assurance level which sort of
rates that trustworthiness of the
systems evaluation assurance level of ei
L is going to be able to use we will be
able to use that to rate the system in
particular you know how well it meets
the claims about security properties
that are important to us so similar to
PC SEC Division D we said basically you
know didn't do very much l1 is the most
basic one and l7 is the most rigorous or
the highest level of trustworthiness
that you can get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
