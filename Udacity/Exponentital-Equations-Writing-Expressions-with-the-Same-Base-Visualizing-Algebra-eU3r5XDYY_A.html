like this notice that these two bases
are different we have 16 raised to the x
power and 4 raised to the third power
the 16 and the four are different basis
so for an equation like this we want to
try and get the basis to match we want
them to be equal so we can rewrite 16
with a base of four will have four
squared which is 16 raised to the X and
the right hand side will stay the same
we know about the properties of
exponents when we raise a power to a
power we multiply these powers together
this means we'll have 4 raised to the 2
X equal to 4 cubed now since both of the
bases are equal we can set 2 X equal to
3 these exponents must be equal to 1
node and finally we divide both sides by
2 to get 1 x is equal to 3 halves now
this value for x should make sense in
our original equation will have 16
raised to the three-halves here and
we'll have 4 cubed on the right hand
side of our equation we know that a
fractional exponent really represents a
route so this really says that we have
the square root of sixteen raised to the
third power we know the square root of
16 equals 4 so we'll have 4 cubed equal
to 4 cubed so yes this checks you try
solving this equation try rewriting
these bases so that way the same and
then see if you can solve for x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
