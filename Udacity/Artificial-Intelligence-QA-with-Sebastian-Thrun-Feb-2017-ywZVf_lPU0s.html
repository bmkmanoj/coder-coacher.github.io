of your instructors and I have here with
me Sebastian Thrun
who will be taking some of your
questions great good seeing you again
most of you please start sure our first
question is related to problem solving
in puzzles and games so a student asks
we use problem solving methods such as
constraint propagation and search for
solving Sudoku puzzles but these methods
do not seem to have any learning in
their behavior right so can machine
learning be used to solve puzzles and
games
yes Attila is the person asking the
question and the answer is yes in
multiple ways there's two very different
races which machining has been used in
the past okay first of all when you
build a game tree you often can't play
all the way to the end like in chess the
tree would be so deep that you would
spend a lot of time researching so
typically you cut off your your research
at some point and then you have to
assess a value to the current position
in a game tree I'd be whole happy.i
alright so in in chess you'd say okay
having a cleaner life is good having the
clean gone as bad so some of the values
is related with number of points but
then it's much more complicated elements
of that so what machinery can do is
learn a valuation function okay and the
variation function is used to guide the
search and also used to cut off an
assignment to cut off a search tree the
other way to use machine learning is for
controls when you expand a search node
you often have a choice to do this move
or this move or this form of this move
machine Ernest Othman used to sort those
and the sorting is actually really
important when you get into n2 will
search alphabetic
you can find that the way the order in
which you search these nodes have
enormous impact on the search complexity
so if you search the best move first you
tend to spend much less time searching
and if you search the worst move first
so machining is often used in search as
well so I think you know what the next
question would be I'm picking it out of
order how did deep mind beat the best go
player so I'm not part of the deep mind
team but another people very well and
they in most puzzler the great valuation
function the problem in go is that the
branching factor is enormous so you have
something like
different moves you can make so if you
go to plies DP have fallen at times
416,000 and we go three type lat the
plies deep you basically I deployed via
computers explodes
so that really mandates an extremely
selective search approach and a really
good assessment of the quality of a
board and where deep learning these
shines is in the assessment of the
quality board I can look at a board and
even if these patterns are very
non-trivial thanks to millions of
training examples they can assess a
really good assessment cool so how would
you go about approaching like building
an agent for Sudoku or NGO which uses
deep learning or machine learning i've
actually in my PhD thesis I were a
cynical neuro chess which is kind of a
deep Koch privilege it just didn't work
out very well but I've trained a new
network to assess the value of a chess
board and the mistake that I've made was
the reason I didn't play well is I play
the start playing on on self play so it
so it would play and then keep playing
his own strategy against itself and then
use the outcome of a game as a training
example then unfortunately gave me very
few training examples so the hours and
hours for a single game so I got bored
so I found this chess database of
120,000 expert chess place and I don't
just plug that in and what the network
did very cleverly after MIT and you can
look at my Tevas
it's a confused causational correlation
so sometimes they're sending indicative
of winning like for some if you're clean
owns the center of the board
you have a point six chance of winning
turns out so if you see a grandmaster
play and one is the queen in the center
in the oven doesn't as higher chance of
winning but what's not the case is if
you just open up and chase and very
quickly move the Queen to the side of
the board that you're gonna win because
very stupid move
so my network confused what experts do
with lots of consideration and try to
rebuild these constellation very quickly
and very inefficiently and as a result
lost of all games in fact the only ones
two games against new chess at the in
the day out of thousands that are tried
when you when you do apply machine
learning to gaming be careful of which
where you apply it and then the best way
is to self play DVD kind of train system
and it goes back to TD gammon is one of
the very early versions of it no
networks and most recently alpha
when you can read up how people did it
don't just go to a large Scalia set and
try to fit in or never from there
because you might be surprised how bad
the result could be okay Sebastian
Caesars that's very interesting
so follow-up to that is do you have any
favorite sort of advanced game playing
technique that you would like to
recommend to students
I mean game playing is hard work and
just take a self-driving car you have to
get all the components right in game
playing there's always components that
can be improved you have to get a video
ficient division data structures that's
really really important and then you
have to get yes yes search D bucket and
your alphabet assertion if you use
killer tables get all that stuff in
order but then I really believe the big
F and now is a steep learning and what's
been done there is amazing and it's not
it's not newest we go to it back to
charity sours work and in 1990s on TD
gammon same stuff besides TD gammon and
maybe the alphago paper is there any
other influential paper on game playing
or search that you would like to
recommend I think there's a long history
of of efficient brute force searches
they Co expect to 1990s in Carnegie
Mellon and then deep blue at IBM which
was the Carnegie Mellon team I don't
have a specific reference paper right
now that I would say people have to read
today other than getting the core right
about alphabet assertions and so on okay
that's that's very good I'm glad that
we're teaching that in our curriculum
good yeah
good fun to code actually yes it's it's
also tricky to understand I know a lot
of our students are struggling with just
understanding like the the way you
assign the different values to alpha
beta nodes and how many propagate them
yeah it's good good to spend time with
it and just draw it out in your brain
it's actually super intuitive right you
get a bound and say look if with this
search I can't even get 10 brownie
points then isn't even worth pursuing
right if I find it in a branch or I
already found a really be my Capone
already has a really really great move
in this branch right that makes the
entire branch not very valuable no
matter what other even better
Musa Musa could find very important so
it's been like a very logical thing when
you get into it right but when you look
at the formula it looks of cryptic so I
think spend some time with it yeah good
thank you so on a slightly different
topic any recommendations for product
managers in AI startups and projects any
additional books or learning materials
that might be applicable to them I think
AI is fundamentally changing in a way
and I just yesterday went to a big AI
conference with lots of professors and I
venture to say that the innovation today
seems to be largely parallel to the work
at universities as a lot of people in
the academic sphere that still do
inference and representations and these
things might make a little sense but I
think the real velocity right now is
with all these people doing deep
learning and massive data saying the big
shift in thinking is in the past when
you program a computer you would
meticulously write on every contingency
right like five million lines of code
would be five millions of what can go
wrong right and now you form a computer
virus give me many examples all right so
if you for example this week we on the
cover of nature my team in Stanford we
did AI for cancer detection and all we
really did is we tossed a couple of
cancers and lung cancers images into
deep learning and I came and I wouldn't
paper that's now I think the fourth-best
side of nature paper over history right
I'm kind of crazy doing the Disney
learning so what what things to choose
to study I guess I would just approach
it with a fresh mind take these success
examples like alphago don't read too
many AI textbooks to be honest I think
it's a mistake to read too much I think
there's too much stuff in there that's
historical and then keep the eye of the
price have very clear metrics that you
care about yeah and measure like in the
Google self-driving car really saving
grace phosphorus that we had a metric
that was the number of miles between
vertical critical interventions and
there was a graft everyday that we
posted and it was so usually went up
somebody went down and the nice thing
about geometric is for one I mean you
you know that you do better and you
focus on the right stuff and secondly in
a setup company you find yourself
discussing a lot right and the
the metrics the more you discuss right
and the clearer the metric in the Google
seven car team we never discussed
because you had like our top 25 things
ranked okay yeah it it person ranking it
for us or 73 percent others 12 than
others and at 0.2% others and then you
sit there and say up 78 is let's do that
it really sorts out the procedure at
which you approach these things that's a
very good tip so so set a clear metric
even if it's a simple metric yeah but as
long as it's well defined yeah as I met
it I mean people often talk about okay
ours and I don't like them because you
set yourself a metric and project what
the result should be and I think it's
just a big lie we just don't know I mean
if you do something interesting new is
I've done before how they could you know
how long it'll take right
so I love the metric part and say let's
do something it does this and it might
take a day or a week or a year that's
okay let's just move as fast as possible
okay that's great um on a different
topic so what do you think about the
algebraic topology or geometry based
techniques that are being applied to
machine learning for feature discovery I
have no strong opinion obviously
features is at the core of what happens
in machine learning and there's been
many different methods being used for
features broadly speaking there are some
that are direct derived from the target
signal it's commonly in deep learning
and there's some that derived from other
methods like for example maximize
entropy in a in a feature layer that if
you want to say we construct the image
originally mix whether the feature layer
contains the most information mm-hm
in all of those might take us at this
point is we do a lot and academia a lot
of arguing which one is the better one
like it's this geometry better or this
technique better is to the vector sanity
of your thorgan allure not orthogonal
and so on this is all been killed by the
by the data issue so we toss in ten
times the data and the method doesn't
matter that much of my hair okay that's
an interesting point of view
perspectivism
yeah that was a college kid I went to
conferences and a person had a no never
with more than 50 unknown parameters the
session would like toss about the
movement sadism possibly can do this
right a galaxy with more than 50
unknowns forget it and then remember it
was a guy named Jim Bowen from Caltech
he had like 50
I know Network you couldn't get a paper
published because the one believe is
possible and now we have millions of
hours and all the wisdom about
bias-variance nm eyes it's been
influenced by this by by massive amounts
of data so I think we live in the age
spend more time finding good data
yeah then arguing what I wouldn't views
that's magic yeah nice so with all this
data you can also think that the
computation part becomes more
challenging and you have to write more
efficient algorithms but at some point
you also have two parallel eyes and
vector eyes so you know there were some
questions about this and we read one is
there an easy way to convert our
algorithms to multi-core / cloud-based
environments this is from Nicolas Volta
yes and no ok if you are so fortunate
that you can data paralyzed like for
example no network and you have 10
million data points and you put a
million on each processor then it's very
trivial right if it turns out that this
parallelism of data is not good enough
for you and you really have to dive into
the mechanisms as the Google team has
done in building tensor flow then it
becomes a very non-trivial um ever since
I was a student the issue of taking a
sequential piece of code and paralyzing
it has been fascinating researcher
without a great solution yeah I think
that that was touched on by another
student who's asking that for a lot of
these search and game-playing agents
we've been teaching them fairly
sequential algorithms but like how do we
how do they build up this mind set off
from the beginning starting to think in
parallel this is one of the ten thousand
or ten million dollar questions that
I've seen when the hordes of researchers
work on and then not seeing a really
satisfactory answer which doesn't maybe
you're not going to find more tomorrow I
think we should find one I mean the
human brain does it beautifully what I
would think is I mean just now let
thoughts of companies to even build para
hardware from the get-go um specifically
I'm letting you on that proxxon similar
those tend to have difficulty with the
connectivity of these units as there's n
square things to pipe around hmm in many
cases I would recommend every person be
seriously interested get yourself a
machine with a hand of course a thousand
course
and play with it my hunters in general
as long as you have some specific
principles right like you minimize a
metric II care about aka for example
greatness in neural networks and and you
have lots of data most learning
administration you work yeah yeah so you
think there is a way to to break down a
problem in such a way that parts are
independent and can be solved separately
yeah I wish there was a simple answer I
mean you can't just take it on that
program put into Amazon Web Services on
a 10,000 machines and expected 10,000
speed-up and for every that part and
four it doesn't work but the a clever
tricks to be paralyzed dataflow mmm cool
well we'll try to explore some of these
on the forums with like more detailed
discussions because I feel like this is
not something that can be answered in
one sentence that's exactly I mean
that's not the fundamental answer right
there might be individual situations
where for example data parallelism is
though I think to do and just works cool
another sort of line of questions is so
a number of these search techniques are
in some sense like advanced computer
science techniques right at what point
do you draw the line between okay this
is computer science and this is where
we're entering AI I always abstain from
these turf wars this is my department or
your department AI people actually the
Sunnis used to feel a bit burned because
a lot of stuff was invented by people
that never was called AI time-sharing
for example as an AI result or certain
programming languages came out of AI and
they're called programming language is
not AI I think boy again for me the
biggest news in all of computer science
is the advent of deep learning and the
reason is it really changes the paradigm
how to program us I envision a time
where computer coding is an unwonted
skill because you don't go anymore
right you just teach so what we learned
today in a nano degree might actually be
useless 20 years from now and we all
teach our computers as opposed to code
them and it's going to happen via
comments rather than it but computer
science go to the end I don't know yeah
the names I don't really care about
honestly yeah obviously data structures
and algorithms it's very related to what
we learn in this class here right yeah I
think we had a similar discussion on a
different forum thread where we're
asking students what is intelligence and
you know where do you where do you start
to call something intelligent versus
just a smart sort of machine yeah yeah
so I think that it's in the eye of the
observer I mean the history is the
moment like so we beat the woods best
chess player than chess tournament
houses anymore yeah that's it yeah so it
tells us is what it is not all right
yeah I think David Joyner pointed that
out in one of the videos saying that you
know something is intelligent only up
till the point that we don't understand
it fully as soon as we start
understanding it's just a mechanism and
it is confusion about like it doesn't
have to have a mood right does it have
to have emotions to be intelligent right
and and then I might my example officer
don't mind my machines to have emotions
that I'm gonna come to the kitchen and
have the refrigerator beating in love
with the dishwasher and therefore
dishwasher is not going to wash my
dishes right yeah so when you liable
machines and and then when it comes to
this if you think about civilization in
general about the last 300 years or so
but we've obviously always build
machines in a comment asks an echo
stronger right so there's no no humanoid
robot has yet found of fields but this
will have solved the farming problem
using like massively great machines and
still require your intelligence tonight
right so it's always its symbioses so
for AI is the same thing I think the
future we don't want to build truly
intelligent AI we want to build machines
that make us intelligent as best people
and it's what's happening that's that's
very good point no going back to to some
of the gaming stuff there's been some
recent interest in poker might in fact a
lot of interest there there has been a
long-term interest there's been some
recent news in the world invoker that
some of the recent poker agents are
starting to beat the best humans so some
of our students were wondering why is it
such a big deal I spoke for such a big
deal I think when you look at games
historically
starting with checkers by the samurai
1940s were way from who
bill the guy was playing Othello out of
Carnegie Mellon carefully and then move
on to deep blue deep thought in Carnegie
Mellon IBM beating the world's best
chess player to go and no to poker all
these every time like a game is taken by
computers there's these smart people who
say but it doesn't do that right so when
chess was claimed which was supposed to
the hardest game on the planet it looked
simple and silly because it didn't have
this enormous branching factor of go now
the goal is claimed glory is kind of
silly
it's just takes a million physicians to
train for Americans yeah the best so
this is something else
poker has a center of deceit as human
element to see there's the essential to
the game and it's not easily
mathematically modelled because I can
tease you I can test you I can learn
about you I can lead you on right
therefore it's another great no
challenge I'm pretty sure once we beat
all human core players good machines
it's gonna look silly we're gonna move
on five five five something else yeah
but do you think in the process we learn
something about DC and you know all your
vets absolutely yes absolutely yes
cool absolutely yes and I was gonna be
really fun to see when the team comes
out even in chess in 97
Evan Kessler over-speeding the winning
team IV empty pocket
they changed essential parameters from
game to game my Kasparov wheels oh it's
playing this way it all some tape this
way you're making me upset yeah I think
we saw that in the go matches as well
where where the human player started to
understand the patterns and was able to
beat the the computer for a certain
period of time right yeah so the go
folks did not mess with the parameters
15 different games they did not stain
from it but I wish with it the IBM team
like that I did okay so in general is
there is there a better term is there
some canonical technique for dealing
with imperfect games and imperfect
information games or incomplete
information games in all of those
situations is a generic set of
techniques I mean they certainly genetic
tests of UNIX if you had game trees
surface is it's too long when you have
improv information you can of course
integrated out go through
all situations rent you die that's very
she learn it comes in machining has this
amazing ability to look at the situation
say this is worth as much even
information is incomplete like in poker
and has this amazing ability is also
happy search mmm-hmm so at some point
you have to put your foot down and say
this is what it's worth yeah is there a
way to like instead of enumerate in
through all possibilities is there a way
to capture you know the possible set of
sort of hands for instance in poker that
someone else might have in a more
generic form so that it's you know
easier to evaluate boy I have have a
problem on poker agent I've played it
occasionally yeah but my suspicion is
that first of all there's gonna be hard
rules of thought that can't be happening
mm-hm and there's gonna be soft rules
like people's behavior reveals some
about the hands obviously and the more
of an account you can get between those
relationships the more informed the
guess you might take about what the
person's going to next but poker is is
tricky because you can stranger strategy
right you can yeah he's your opponent
and then lead them on for a while and
maybe train the wrong behavior into a
poker we'll all right we'll keep an eye
on how this evolved it's a fantastic
thing to play with honestly and yeah and
participated competitions is great fun
to be in competitions yeah and then talk
to other people what they do and learn
from them yeah it's completely
non-trivial my VN yeah because I think
you know some of these techniques do
extend to the real world where you have
you know probabilistic scenarios or
scenarios where you don't have complete
information about the world and you
still kind of have to make take
decisions I mean when cynical comment is
that I think in the way we make
decisions that we have autism
unfortunately extremely unrelated to
data science and to machine learning and
to game playing it's often extremely ad
hoc all right now there is often based
on false facts and the Liberty false
facts to pursue an agenda so I think
what you learn in a class like this
which is great for computer which makes
computers in the end superior to us it's
not being practiced very very
politicians hmm
without naming names yes but we all know
who are talking about
so I think you've mentioned this already
several times but just to confirm so is
ml or deep-learning sort of the Silver
Bullet for AI or is there something else
to come that we haven't seen yet I think
I mean obviously the game of the week or
the the year is steep learning a machine
learning as there's no question and I
think it's much more than just a I it's
it's all of society it's all of computer
science because it's for the first time
be able to where think about this use of
the machinery for a long time as I
mentioned even my master and PhD thesis
was about machine learning and the kind
of brain that we were able to command
was like a mosquito brain okay and now
we are at the point where I have the
same methods and we can command a human
brain and of course the human is much
more interesting in making decisions
than a mosquito is that's this video but
the Iowans are the same the neurons are
the same the DNA is a lot of overlap
between mosquitoes and humans and so on
so I think we just got the scale right
and what this empowers us to do is to
really move away from painstakingly
writing code the way we did in the past
or you like every contingency you don't
raise kids the first 18 years telling
them every contingency about life and
then say go around alright you shouldn't
do the same with computers the big
mistake in my opinion says it's local
minima in history of computer science
but it just for violin we're going to
move on having said this there are
elements of AI that transcend beyond
machine learning which is really
important and I think we're going to
rediscover them like for example you
can't prime an AI system by giving all
the books and have information likes of
wisdom we want to say what we just did
diagnosing skin cancer there's lots of
books written about skin cancer they can
be read about it and understand it and
the parsing of natural language is
possible but fusing this back into an
image system is it's not yet done
so all the rule knowledge we have the
written knowledge we have the language
knowledge we have that can contribute is
hard to harvest and and equally hard to
harvest is is this entire notion that
you really go to one thing and then in
bootstrap to the next thing transfer
learning is rich corralling is to call
it when we preserve look at google 7-car
it's use machine learning massively but
it can't fly a plane right if you were
to fly a plane you would suffer scratch
so I think there's a lot of
that's today in the history that will be
coming back in if I were to put my money
on one thing I would be what's called
hybrid methods where you have some
rule-based information that you get from
somewhere and some data and in diffusion
together cool I think that's a good note
to wrap up on do you have any final
thoughts for our students they're in
their first couple of weeks in the
program not not too long first of all
I'm a biggest fan I'm so glad you guys
are doing is a fantastic thing to do in
your life to learn about AI and ng
skills and hopefully you spend most of
your time doing stuff yourself I just
came back from an international trip and
was jet-lagged in a program with Sudoku
solver and it was a lot of fun just
program which to me or two hours and
solved even the hardest local games
experience this joy and this fun and and
be fearless I think with this especially
this day and age with the advent of
machine learning as a new component and
things like game playing we can
fundamentally rewrite almost everything
and really have a big impact in the
world
I often wind up when people ask me about
the impact of the eye I often tell her
look 75% of us work in offices in the
developed world whatever that means the
United States and pretty much all these
people do extremely repetitive work like
your accountant your lawyer your
dermatologist right your judge they all
doing like dog legal document discovery
they do spreadsheet math they do
drafting of legal documents in all these
things in my opinion here I will just
take over and the reason is I watch this
long enough it can do a better a better
job and AI has this advantage that it
can learn from many sources and can
transfer this knowledge right when we
humans learn something it's very hard
for us to transfer like we have a new
child they're not born with a high
school diploma but in the island if a
new serfdom and car is born it has the
entire wisdom of all the previous cars
as a result all these accesses we get
strong and strong and eventually be able
to do 80% of our work and when they do
ages of our work office work it's going
to be really big and it can be massive
shift in money in society productivity
and what we do it's going to be as big
as the Agricultural Revolution
now it's the mental the
version so get into this find yourself
something that you do repetitively maybe
your friends do and put an eye on it and
see what happens in here and work on
this is the most rewarding thing and if
you do a good job come to Silicon Valley
and we find your company yeah that's
awesome thank you for joining us Bastian
a real pleasure thanks for joining us
today
we'll hopefully we answered some of your
questions will hopefully Sebastian was
