at the Python documentation and hashable
here's a link if you click on it you'll
get to the glossary that explains what
hashable means it says that an object is
hashable if it's hash value never
changes during this lifetime that means
it has an underscore hash method and it
can be compared to other objects this is
still quite a difficult definition it's
not something that tells you very
clearly what's hashable and what's not
the second part of it is more useful it
says that all of pythons immutable
built-in objects are hashable
that makes sense because their value
doesn't change they can map to the same
object using hash and none of the
immutable containers are and their
examples are ones that you should be
familiar with lists and dictionaries as
mutable containers that are not hashable
and the reason it's important for things
to be hashable well we've seen this with
dictionary keys if we want to use a hash
function to look up the value of a key
well we need to know that that key can't
change if it could change when we did
our look up in the dictionary if you
remember what we did with dictionaries
well we had a key that was the input to
some hash function along with the
dictionary size and that would give us a
mapping to some bucket if the hash of
the key could change so if the key was
something that can be mutated well the
next time we look it up if the key has
changed we're going to hash it and we're
going to look in the wrong bucket so
that's why things need to be hashable to
be put in a dictionary that's the same
thing for sets and if the value of an
item could change
well that would break the representation
of the set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
