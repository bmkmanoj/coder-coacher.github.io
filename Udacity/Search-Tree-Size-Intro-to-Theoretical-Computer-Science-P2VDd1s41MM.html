analysis actually so you can have much
better search trees and even for this
tree here you can do a better analysis
because actually this tree doesn't
always have height k for the three cases
that you branch in in one of the cases
as you remember you put two vertices
into the vertex cover so this one here
this one here and here you put two
actually that already decreases the size
of the tree so doing this type of
analysis is out of the scope of this
course actually if you were to do this
then you would find out that the size of
the tree is approximately 2.4 to the
power of K and again they're even better
search trees for this the main point
however is this look at what we have
just done we have just discovered a
search tree for vertex cover for which
the size does not depend on the size of
the input at all the size of this search
tree only depends on the integer K it
doesn't matter if we do it for a graph
with 10 vertices 100 vertices or 1000
vertices the size of the search tree
only depends on K and it gets better if
we implement this as an algorithm to
solve vertex cover so the decision
version of vertex cover now look at this
running time here and what that means
the running time of year will be two
point four to the power of K times n to
the power of some constant depending on
how you implement it but n to the power
of three will do here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
