want you to learn from this course is to
develop the eye of a designer so you
should be walking around the world
looking all the time looking at things
around you judging saying that's a
really good example or ooh that's a bad
example but when you do this it's really
good to document it not only for your
own benefit because you want to show
them to other people you might want to
show them to clients you might want to
give a talk and illustrate the points so
you have to have pictures and the
pictures have to be effective show
exactly the point you're trying to make
and tell a story so it may take several
pictures of the same object to tell the
story so in this next assignment we're
going to cover that so let's start off
though with what it takes to make a good
picture first of all the camera you know
doesn't do any good to have a great
camera if it isn't with you so the most
important aspect about a camera is have
it with you so take a look at this one
cell phone camera it's always with you
that's a virtue problem is it's not
really a good camera it can't be it's
just too small so if you want to take a
picture and the object you have is
really small you want to enlarge it now
cell phone camera isn't good enough but
in an emergency this is the best camera
to use I use it all the time the really
best camera would be something like this
this is a single lens reflex six high
quality pictures it's a very big
detector high quality lens but it's big
its bulky so I myself don't use it I
would love to but I just can't imagine
carrying it with me all the time so I
compromise I carry medium size camera
carefully chosen so it's of the highest
quality that's small enough though that
it will fit in my pocket or it fits in a
bag on my belt
has a good lens has a fairly large
sensor so it takes high quality pictures
that I can blow up and all the pictures
in the design of everyday thing that I
took were taken with this camera
second point take lots of pictures don't
take one picture don't sit there and
just try to take one or two
professionals might take hundreds of
pictures just to get one so take lots of
pictures from different angles different
zoom lenses closer further away and
weave different lighting don't use flash
flash wipes out all the details but make
sure to turn on all the lights and maybe
use a piece of white paper as a
reflector do whatever you can do to
light it as well as you can naturally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
