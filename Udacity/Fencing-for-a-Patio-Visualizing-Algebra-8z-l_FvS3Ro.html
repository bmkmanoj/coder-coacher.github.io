by nine the length is 12 feet long and
the width is nine feet long great
thinking if you found these two numbers
now this required us to solve a
quadratic equation so don't worry if
they give you trouble we haven't even
done a problem like this yet we're going
to start by taking our area equation and
we're going to replace this L with the
expression 21 minus W we want to make
sure we use parentheses here since we're
replacing this L with this expression
will need to multiply W to each of these
terms inside the parentheses so 21 times
W equals 21 w and negative w times W is
negative w squared we need to set this
equation equal to zero so we arranged
these two terms and move them to the
other side so we'll subtract 21 w from
both sides and add w squared to both
sides this leaves us with w squared
minus 21 w plus 108 equals 0 now we're
ready to try to factor our quadratic you
want to find factors of 1 x 108 or just
108 that sum to negative 21 those two
factors are negative 9 and negative 12
if we set each factor equal to 0 then we
know that W can equal positive 9 or W
can equal positive 12 and maybe this is
where you might have gotten confused we
have the width can equal 9 or the width
can equal 12 if the width does equal 9
we know that the entire perimeter should
be 42 so doing some mental math we know
that the length would have to be 12 in
order for the entire perimeter to be 42
feet we could get that same result by
using our area formula we know this area
is 108 and now we know the width the
width is 9 so we divide both sides by 9
to get the length is equal to 12 or 12
feet now if we would have let the width
equal 12 feet we would have gotten this
rectangle it's really the same exact
rectangle it's just been rotated 90
degrees the longest dimension of a
closed figure or any three-dimensional
shape is considered to be the length so
instead of making the width equal 12
will make the length equal 12
the width equal 9 finally it's always
best to check your result to make sure
that the perimeter and the area or what
we expect it to be if we add up all the
sides together we get a parameter of 42
just like was stated in our problem and
if we multiply the length in the width
we get an area of a hundred and eight
square feet this is why we know these
two answers are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
