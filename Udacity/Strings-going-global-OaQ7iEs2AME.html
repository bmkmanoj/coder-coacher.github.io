translation into your app here I've made
a Translate app and I'm going to make it
display text that translates
automatically to our language of
interest in this case will include
translations to Spanish and French so
I've started with the main activity with
an empty view so the first thing we need
to do is to create some text by creating
a text view and we can do that in our
activity main.xml file right now we just
have our empty layout so let's create a
text view that appears at the top of our
screen and displays the text hello world
our text view automatically gives us our
layout width and layout height and since
I want our text to appear at the top of
our screen I'm going to give these
dimensions that take up the whole screen
which is going to be wrap content for
both great now I need one more parameter
that's the text that this will contain
so I say Android text equals now I can
put any string I want to be displayed
and i'll put hello world now let's see
if this worked it did we see it appear
right at the top of our screen and
actually let me change the text size so
that it's bigger ok I change the text
size to be 24 DP so that should be
bigger great now it's a little more
visible and we can change this text to
anything we want just by changing the
wording in our text view so instead of
hello world I could say goodbye and then
save it and it'll change but to display
this in different languages we want to
be able to load this string from a file
and change it based on the language we
want so we don't actually want to hard
code it in our view like we've done
instead for any text we use will want to
reference it from our file that contains
all our strings our strings.xml file our
strings are contained in our values
folder so let's take a look at what's in
there we already have a string called
app name that says translate that's the
title of our app and 14 settings as well
these were automatically generated so
now let's make our own so in our
strings.xml file let's create a string
with the variable name hello world then
this string tag will include the word or
phrase we want to display so let's just
write in hello world here then we'll
want to reference this variable when we
go to display our text view and to
reference it will be using the very
name hello underscore world so let's go
back to our text view in activity main
and delete our hard coded text to
reference our string variable in
strings.xml we have to say at string and
you'll see some pop up all the strings
that are stored in our strings.xml file
so we want to say out string then slash
the variable name we want which in this
case is our hello world string now let's
save this and see what's displayed hello
world it worked and loading the string
instead of writing it indirectly makes
it easy for us to include different
languages for example to include the
string and Spanish we just have to open
a translation editor up here we click on
the little world icon and edit
translations we see all our string
variables action settings app name and
hello world which I'm going to focus on
so to add a spanish translation to hello
world I just click on this world icon
again and you can see all these options
for different languages so I'll scroll
all the way down to spanish and when I
click it these boxes appear under a
Spanish option our app name will stay
the same unless we change it and we have
to include translations for settings and
hello world and any other strings we
added so let's include a spanish
translation for hello world we go down
here to the translation box and type in
our translation instead of hello world
will have hola mundo and let's add one
more type of translation let's add a
French one so again we go to our world
icon and scroll down to French and we
have another column appearing for the
french language and I'll write my
translation instead of hello world I'll
have Bonjour to lamont and so all these
different translations are now assigned
to our same string variable hello
underscore world then for any devices
that are in Spanish or French our app
will check in here for any Spanish
resources or French resources and if it
can't find any it will go back to our
default value and it's the same process
for any other languages you want to add
so localization can be as simple as that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
