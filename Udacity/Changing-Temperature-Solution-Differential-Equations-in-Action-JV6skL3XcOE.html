that t1 decays exponentially 20 we're
losing a certain fraction every hour
this does not make sense with this
differential equation t2 would gain from
t1 the red process would be in place but
we would never lose anything this is not
true and the second differential
equation initially t2 is smaller than t1
meaning that this difference is negative
the rate of change of t2 would initially
at least be negative which does not make
sense t2 has to grow the first one is
correct a percentage of ten percent Oh
point one per hour of t2 flowing into t1
and there is minus ten percent per hour
of t1 flowing out of t1 and in a similar
fashion the lower one is true Stan
percent per hour of t1 flowing into t2 a
plus sign here and there's minus ten
percent per hour of t2 flowing out of t2
minus so actually what's of interest to
us is only the difference of the
temperatures footnote so we could have
been using degree Celsius and degrees
Fahrenheit all the way because we're
forming this difference and are not
interested in the total amount of energy
contained in each compartment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
