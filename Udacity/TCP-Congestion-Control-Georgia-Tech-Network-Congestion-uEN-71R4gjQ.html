continue to increase their rate until
they see packet drops in the network
packet drops occur because the sender's
are sending at a rate that is faster
than the rate at which a particular
router and the network might be able to
drain its buffer so you might imagine
for example that if all three of these
senders are sending at a rate that is
equal to the rate at which the router is
able to send traffic downstream then
eventually this buffer will fill up TCP
interprets packet loss as congestion and
when senders see packet loss they slow
down as a result of seeing the packet
loss this is an assumption packet drops
are not a sign of congestion in all
networks for example in wireless
networks there may be packet loss due to
corrupted packets as a result of
interference but in many cases packet
drops do result because some router in
the network has a buffer that has filled
up and can no longer hold any more
packets and hence it drops the packets
as they arrive so senders increase rates
until packets are dropped periodically
probing the network to check whether
more bandwidth has become available then
they see packet loss interpret that as
congestion and slow down so congestion
control has two parts one is an increase
algorithm and the other is a decrease
algorithm in the increase algorithm the
sender must test the network to
determine whether the network can
sustain a higher sending rate in the
decrease algorithm the sender's react to
congestion to achieve optimal loss rates
delays and sending rates let's now talk
about how senders can achieve these
increase in decrease algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
