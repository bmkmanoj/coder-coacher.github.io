was actually electricity Benjamin
Franklin did something well something
incredibly stupid now it's not entirely
certain that Franklin actually did this
experiment but what's believed is that
he took a kite out into a windy raging
thunderstorm and as the kite flew and
the string got wet well he tied a key to
that string his thinking being that well
if this lightning is somehow electricity
there's got to be a ton of this
electricity in the sky and so he
probably didn't actually allow the Chi
to get struck by lightning because that
could have been fatal instead he led the
kite to fly close to the clouds where he
hoped it would collect electricity that
electricity he hoped would be
transferred somehow along this wet kite
string into the key which could then be
touched to this what's called an
electrode of the Leyden jar thus
charging the jar when he did the
experiment it worked what he set out to
do actually happened he showed that
since lightning can be used to charge a
Leyden jar lightning must be electricity
for the rest of this unit we're going to
learn about electricity now I have to
say this is usually a subject that's
covered over an entire course so what
we're going to do here is learn the very
basics enough to protect our buildings
from being struck by lightning but this
is really just a teaser we're really
just skimming the surface of what there
is to learn about electricity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
