unit in the debugging course it's topic
is asserting expectations today we will
go and explore assertions that is
statements in the program that
automatically check for errors during
execution assertions are by far the most
powerful debugging tool in particular
because they are the key to automating
debugging that is debug while you sleep
if debugging were a video game and you
would be hunted by bugs
then assertions would be a power pill
that would help you catch all the bugs
weawy weawy weawy okay pacifically we're
going to learn how to write assertions
how to check assertions and how to infer
assertion from executions automatically
in our last lecture we already had met
the assert keyword from Python generally
speaking the statement assert condition
evaluates the condition and then its
behavior depends on whether the
condition evaluates to true or to false
if the condition holds we proceed as
usual if the condition does not hold
however then we enter a program
execution by throwing an exception when
you're writing your condition you see
that condition will hold this is
normally useful when you're writing a
test for instance if we want to test a
function square root we can write a test
function that asserts that square root
of 4 is 2 and square root of 9 is 3 and
if any of these tests fail that is if
the result of square root of 4 is not 2
then the assertion will fail and throw
an exception such a functionality of
assertion is available in all
programming languages you could even
write your own assert function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
