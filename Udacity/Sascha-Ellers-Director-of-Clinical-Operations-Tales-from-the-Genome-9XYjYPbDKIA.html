of clinical operations I'm from San
Francisco California all right and what
does a director of clinical operations
do exactly so I work with physicians and
researchers to run clinical trials I
take the ideas that the clinical staff
the physicians have with a protocol and
I work to implement that protocol so I
will go out to key opinion leaders which
are most likely physicians try to
recruit them to participate in the study
I will work with data that comes out of
the study so data that's from the
patients that enroll in the study do
monitoring which is basically verifying
that the data that's recorded for our
study is accurate and matches what the
data looks like in the patient's medical
records and then you know all of the all
of the work that it takes to receive a
study it's a regulated environment so
it's regulated by the FDA or if in some
cases research isn't regulated by the
FDA but it's always regulated by good
clinical practice and international
guidelines on how to take care of
patients so you have to actually be
informed of a lot of different things to
be able to carry this out yes now for
those people who may be slightly
unfamiliar with how clinical trial works
or even what one is can you tell us just
briefly the significance of a clinical
trial sure so anytime you want to test
an intervention be it a drug a
diagnostic test or even just changes in
behavior you want to show that there's
actually a difference you want to run a
clinical trial because that's going to
give you the gold standard to show you
that there's a difference with your with
your drug or your intervention so the
clinical trial itself is a way to ask
your question prospectively design your
experiment in humans and then implement
that study see so this is sort of like
that okay prove that it works kind of
thing exactly and this process you said
itself is regulated by the government by
the FDA correct by the FDA and must you
pass a clinical trial to carry out your
test or your diagnostic or whatever you
want to do
is that part of the requirement of ever
selling your product it depends so to
back up there there are three phases of
clinical trial development for a drug
there's phase one where you're looking
for your safety so you've got to prove
that you're not going to do undue harm
to people with your dog and then in
phase 2 you're further refining your
safety day and you're starting to look
at efficacy and then phase 3 are your
large efficacy trials where you're
treating a lot of patients with the drug
at that point so that's kind of the
basic methodology but then within that
context yeah there is it is regulated by
the FDA they do have a say in what
they're going to accept from the phase 3
trials is something that they are
willing to approve and so a lot of
effort goes into putting together a
study that's going to meet their
requirements it sounds like it takes a
lot of time to do this yes it's sort of
a big commitment from anybody interested
big commitment for companies a lot of
resources go into these trials and
academic settings a lot of resources
will go into these these studies as well
a recent example that's been approved as
a drug called zelboraf that looks at
mutation in the melanoma cancer called
v600e so it looks at this mutation and
says if the patient is positive for this
mutation that if the cancer is positive
for this mutation this would be a good
drug for the patient to try and if they
don't have the mutation they're probably
not going to respond to the drug at all
so this is a great example of using
genetics in in a clinical study to
select patients but you can also use the
genetic information to stratify patients
if you want to compare patients with the
marker to those without so it would just
be a marker that would be used to look
at how you could break apart those two
groups to look at who did better or not
in that case right and you said so
that's an example of something that sort
of went through this process and has
been approved yes part of the problem
with with clinical studies is that
you're confined to the population that
you're testing them in so sometimes
we'll see a signal when we look at the
entire dataset they'll be a signal in a
subset of patients but you don't really
know why you've wasted a lot of money on
a negative trial one of the
opportunities that Jeanette
provides is to help us get the right
patient on the right trial so that
increases the likelihood that we're
going to have a positive outcome for the
trial and decreases the risk to the
patients or subjects of being exposed to
treatments that are going to help them
so I think that that's one of the most
exciting things about the future of a
personalized genetics in looking at
developing drugs and treatments tell us
a bit more about your background how did
you get to be a director of clinical
operations what did you study in school
what did you do before you got here yeah
so I have a bachelor's degree in biology
when I finish school I didn't really
know what I wanted to do I feel really
lucky that I found this this world of
clinical studies so I I started out in a
CRO contract research organization so
these are companies that serve pharma
companies by helping to run the clinical
trials is it's out sourced to that group
and so I i had my first job in a company
like that and from there came into
biotech and pharma and diagnostics and
have found it to just be a lot of fun I
like to solve problems right so that's
it's a great place to apply that so it
sounds like you really get to in your
job you really get to sort of be exposed
to a lot of ideas and subjects that deal
with genetics but you also really get
the sort of I guess I like the the verb
wallow in the the ethics to and really
have to be concerned about procedure you
have to pay attention to detail you've
got to sort of know technically what's
going on but you've also got to be able
to remember where you are and what
you're doing with regards to okay this
is a human study and these are all the
things we have to go through yeah
exactly um in general how would you
describe how difficult is this job do
you think compared to other jobs or it's
difficult probably in a different way
than somebody's actually crunching the
data we have to think through problems
like sometimes we'll have a study that
it's it's well designed it could yield
great data but we just can't find the
right subjects that want to join the
study so then a lot of effort goes into
recruitment planning for the study I've
never worked on two studies that have
the same problems they're always
different so and then native builds on
itself you'll learn okay we got to have
recruitment plans in place before we
start the study we've we've got to think
through how we're going to ensure
quality data before we start the study
all of these things that kind of become
part of the methodology but yet every
study has its own issues and the
landscape changes early in my career I
worked on a drug called sutent I worked
on a phase one study of ceuta in
gastrointestinal stromal tumors and so
when I saw that it was approved I that
was really exciting i also worked on a
drug called pertuzumab the scalper jetta
and it's approved for metastatic breast
cancer so that's been exciting if you if
somebody's watching you right now and
they're super excited they're like wow
that sounds like a really cool kind of
job what advice would you give them to
either learn more or what advice would
you give them to learn more or to
possibly you know become a clinical
operations director themselves like us
that the main advice would be not to
just focus on drug companies to look
across the board for other places that
are running studies and and see if there
are opportunities there would you
recommend anybody who's interested to
try to get work experience before school
experience in this I think work
experience is the foot in the door that
will help to land the job yeah and what
kind of work experience exactly um so
there are entry-level positions student
running clinical trials they're called a
clinical trial associate but also
background in a physician's practice
that are that where they're running
studies is another great way to get
exposure to it oh thank you so much for
joining us and you know wish you the
best of luck continuing your clinical
operations thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
