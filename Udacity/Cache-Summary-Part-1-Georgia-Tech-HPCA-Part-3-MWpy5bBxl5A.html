aspects of how caches work
let's summarize them for a more
realistic cache let's say we have a 4
kilobyte 4-way set associative cache
with the 64 byte line size with the
write back and write allocate write
policies the processor let's say creates
64-bit addresses to access the cache
when accessing this cache the 64-bit
address will be divided into offset bits
index bits and tag bits first for offset
bits it's a 64 byte line so we need 6
bits bits 0 through 5 there are 6 of
them are gonna tell us where in the
cache block we are next we need to
determine how many sets this cache has
it's a 4 kilobyte cache that's 2 to the
12 bytes the number of blocks is that
divided by 64 which is 2 to the sixth so
we have 2 to the sixth blocks in the
cache
it's a 4-way set associative cache which
means that every set has 4 blocks in it
so we divide the number of blocks with
the number of blocks in a set and we get
2 to the 4th or 16 sets now we know that
we need 4 bits to tell us which set we
are in so bits 6 7 8 and 9 four of them
are the index the bits that remain bits
10 through 63 54 of them are the tag now
in our cache we will have for each block
a valid bit it's a write back cache so
we will also have a dirty bit then there
will be a tag 54 bits
it's a 4-way set associative cache so we
need to pick a replacement policy let's
say the replacement policies LRU for a
4-way set associative cache each block
needs to have a two bit LRU counter so
here we have 1 1 54 2 and then we have
64 bytes
worth of actual data as you can see we
have 58 bytes in addition to the data so
there is some overhead the cache size is
usually expressed in terms of how much
data it contains but the actual size of
the cache array is larger because it
needs to contain all of these extra bits
for each line of data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
