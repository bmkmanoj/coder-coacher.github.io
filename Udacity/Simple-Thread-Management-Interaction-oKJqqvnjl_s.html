have threads at the kernel level we will
now see what are some of the
interactions that are necessary in order
to efficiently manage threads consider
we have a multi-threaded process and
let's say that process has four user
level threads however the process is
such that at any given point of time the
actual level of concurrency is just 2
basically if you look at the process it
always happens that two of its user
level threads are waiting on i/o and
then some other two are actually
executing so if our operating system has
a limit on the number of kernel threads
that it can support it would be nice if
the user level process actually said I
just really need two threads so in the
process starts the kernel will first
give it let's say a default number of
kernel level threads
in the accompanying lightweight thread
and let's say that is 1 then the process
will request additional kernel level
threads and the way it's done is that
the kernel now supports a system call
called set concurrency in response to
the system called the kernel will create
additional threads and it will allocate
those to this process now let's consider
the scenario in which the two user level
threads that were mapped on the
underlying kernel level threads block
they needed to perform some IO operation
and then they were basically moved on
the wait queue that's associated with
that particular ayah event so the kernel
level threads are blocked as well now
let's say we have a situation in which
the two user level threads that were
running concur no level threads issued
an IO request and now have to wait for
that to complete so it's a blocking I on
but that means is that the kernel level
threads themselves they're also blocked
on that i/o operation they're waiting in
a queue somewhere in the kernel for that
IO event to occur now we have a
situation where the process as a whole
is blocked because it only had two
kernel level threads both of them are
blog and there are user level threads
that are ready to run and make progress
the reason why this is happening is
because the user level library doesn't
know what is happening in the kernel it
doesn't know that the kernel threads are
about to block
what would have really been useful is if
the colonel had notified the user-level
library before it blocks the colonel
level threat and then the user level
library can look at its run queue you
can see that it has multiple runnable
user level threats and in response can
let the colonel know so call a system
call to request more kernel level
threats or lightweight processes now in
response to this call the colonel can
allocate an extra kernel level thread
and the library can start scheduling the
remaining queues or level threats on to
the Associated lightweight process at a
later time when the I operation
completes at some point the kernel will
notice that one of the kernel level
threats is pretty much constantly idle
because we said that that's the natural
state of this particular application so
maybe the kernel can tell the kernel
level library that you no longer have
access to this kernel level threats you
can schedule on it by going through
these examples we realize that both the
user level library doesn't know what's
happening in the kernel but also the
kernel doesn't know what's happening at
the user level both of these facts cause
for some problems to correct for these
issues we saw how in the Solaris
threading implementation they introduced
certain system calls and special signals
that can be used to pass or request
certain things among these two layers
and basically this is how the kernel
level and the user level thread
management interact and coordinate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
