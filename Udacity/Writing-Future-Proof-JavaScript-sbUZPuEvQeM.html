optimization we can do to our JavaScript
and it's quite similar to how we use
sass instead of CSS turns out there's a
way of running the very latest spec of
JavaScript atma script 6 even though
there's no native browser support for
many of the features all we need is a
transpiler which takes one programming
language and converts it into another
sometimes transpiler stay very close to
acma script syntax adding in a few
features here and there in other cases
they are full implementations of
languages you don't typically find in
purely front-end web development will
stick to the former category our
transpiler of choice is Babel GS it's
very popular feature rich and well
supported by the community now of course
this step is purely optional if you're
happy with today's JavaScript and don't
need all the fanciness great but if
you're curious to try out arrow
functions generators in classes and now
is the perfect time ensure enough
getting this into our code is as simple
as everything else just grab the gulp
babel plugin and require it in your goat
file and in both script task type it
after the goat that source but before
the concatenation you won't see any
difference right away as you're not
actually using any es6 magic in your
current code so head over to babbles es6
learning page and get familiar with some
of the concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
