of an utterance or sentence what words
it has whether they fit the
subject-object-verb
kind of ordering but we haven't really
looked at what they mean it turns out
that these two are not the same thing
and one of the most famous counter
examples comes again from our man Noam
Chomsky with the sentence colorless
green ideas sleep furiously this is a
sentence that's syntactically
well-formed ideas is the noun sleep is
the verb this is an adverb these are all
modifiers that make it a noun phrase but
it's not clear what the meaning is
actually let me try to sketch it out so
we've got some ideas and I hear that one
always represents ideas with old timey
lightbulbs except that our ideas are
colorless so let's ignore this yellow
somehow and simultaneously green this
it's not obvious how to draw this and
then they're sleeping and I think the
universal symbol for that in English is
a bunch of Z's this is the sound that
snoring makes in colloquial English but
they're sleeping furiously so lots of
Z's and as my total difficulty to sketch
this should point out well eh I'm bad at
sketching but B it's really not clear
what this means what does it mean for an
idea to sleep I thought ideas were
conceptions that people had kin ideas go
to sleep and people can try to put
poetic interpretations on this you can
imagine a sort of a a prose or poetic
way of reading this but in general I can
sort of alter the sentence and make it
still syntactically correct but
semantically more and more contradictory
so it's really not clear what this
sentence means turns out that we have
similar notions in computer programming
languages in Python you can write 1 plus
1 or hello plus world and get reasonable
answers out but what happens if I try to
write 1 plus hello this does not really
make sense it's not clear what it means
to add an integer to a string and in
general if you feed such a program
fragment or expression to a Python
interpreter it will give you some sort
of runtime error which is the equivalent
of throwing up its hands and saying I
don't know just to review what it means
for a program to lead to a runtime error
to describe something that doesn't make
much semantic sense here I've written
four program fragments and what I'd like
you to do is check each one that would
lead to some sort of runtime error and
you have to assume that each one is a
complete program so what you see is what
you get there are no other hidden
variables or imports declared earlier
multiple multiple choice try it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
