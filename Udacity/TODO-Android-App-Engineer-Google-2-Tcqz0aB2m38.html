layout in your app well even here this
cluster of three cards is is a
horizontal linear layout where we just
add child views like three cards and
then we set layout width to zero deep
and layout weight to one and essentially
it instructs a linear layout to take
however much width it has at runtime and
distributed evenly based on the relative
weights distributed evenly between all
the all the child views in that group so
that's one example and another example
would be over here that you have new and
updated games and the more button which
is a cluster header it's also a simple
horizontal linear layout so when things
are simple you don't necessarily want to
start writing custom layouts don't just
use relative layout everywhere because
it's more versatile than linear layout
for example that's just overkill for
simpler things so when a designer gives
you a mock how do you go about starting
to build that app so hopefully at that
point and like we talked we have not
just one mock but rather at least two or
three that show how how the design
scales between a small screens and large
screens and then I want to identify a
building blocks so if we talk about
something like a card which appears in a
lot of places in the app I wouldn't want
necessarily to start like implementing a
lot of variants of the same card based
on if it needs to show a small image or
a big image or maybe show a one-line
title instead of two line titles so I'm
trying to identify these blocks and
implement them as like you know
standalone classes standalone layouts
and then start building on top of those
so you start from text view image view
spinner and whatnot to build smaller
blocks and then hopefully you are able
to
keep on taking those small blocks and
build the larger blocks while reusing
the same basic set of blocks and what's
nice about it is even though you spend
maybe a little bit more time upfront it
becomes easier especially if the design
is consistent in how it applies its
language to evolve the app and to add
new features if the design is consistent
and you keep on seeing the same blocks
being used in different configurations
again and again and then that's where
your initial investment starts paying
off where you don't treat implementation
of a new screen as a brand new thing but
rather maybe 50 60 70 however much
percent is already there maybe it needs
a little bit tweaking with color so
maybe typography or whatnot but
hopefully if the design is consistent
and the implementation is also easier to
move forward if you already build for
that and it also becomes easier to apply
a redesign just on the visual level if
you want to tweak colors if you want to
tweak typography if you want to to add
maybe like we did in a lollipop where
you have this ripple effects when you
press something if you have a few pieces
that you keep on reusing your Styles
your layouts then you do that visual
refresh in a smaller number in a fewer
number of places and then hopefully they
get applied consistently everywhere so
for me I want to place the focus at the
beginning on getting the data right
especially for an app that is getting
its data from external sources and then
do closer to the pixels refine the
pixels once you have the data to do
degree to do the typography colors
animations transitions whatnot however
much time you have to spend on that and
I think it would be the same if you have
something like a Twitter client like you
know you can start by pixel perfecting
your layouts with some fake data and
then you discover that like you know you
you know nothing about fetching the day
from Twitter and it takes you the next
three months just to fetch the data or
just an example so I prefer to start
from the data I think about this as an
iceberg where you see the pretty big
cells as like maybe like five ten
percent above the surface and then
there's a lot of work going below the
surface if you will to support that you
mention the tip of the iceberg is what
people see so what exactly is going on
below the surface how do you see the
Google Play app so what happens below
the surface is first of all to get the
data from the network so you have so
like you know authenticate to the server
and get the date and then maybe to cache
it locally so that the next time you go
like you know you go from the stream
into the details page and back into the
stream we should be using cache data
cache images so that like you know we
don't put too much strain on the battery
and also the app already shows the
information that it has then you have a
support for multiple accounts that you
have maybe persisting a few bits here
and there in the database then we have
the billing flows which is most of that
work is done on the server doing the
great with different payment methods and
then there's the work on the client as
well and another big part of the yeah
play store is downloading and installing
apps and games we are on the Play Store
side we are in charge of downloading
installing updating apps and so that's
another big chunk of once again pretty
much all of these have their surface
bits which are pixels on the screen and
then there's a lot of work going on
behind the worldís surface to to bring
that information for the right account
and to put that on the screen it's clear
that you've worked on many different
iterations of Google Play app how do you
keep up to date with the latest news and
Android there's there's a lot of fun
information on
Google+ from very active Android
developers who put out a lot of
tutorials and just from different blogs
and sometimes I don't necessarily go and
read deeply a certain a certain serious
about like recyclerview or or a
viewpager or whatnot or like how to I
configure the toolbar in action bar I
kind of try to put it like that I know
that there's a lot of information in
there and then when I do need that deep
level of information then I go to those
resources well thank you so much for
your time Kirill I think our students
will really enjoy hearing your
perspective on what it's like to be an
Android app engineer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
