to address deals with
internationalization in reality web
browsers like Firefox or Internet
Explorer can handle words string
sentences in languages other than
English the question from students is
basically how does that work what's up
with that and to answer that fully I
need to take a little aside into how we
even represent English characters it
turns out that it's totally arbitrary
we're essentially going to use numbers
under the hood computers can already
manipulate numbers let's say we believe
that's possible computer file could just
be a big list of numbers well we're all
going to agree on a standard that
certain numbers stand for certain
letters this standard is totally
arbitrary for example the decimal number
65 stands for uppercase English egg the
decimal number 66 is uppercase English
be why did we start at 65 why not this
standard is called ascii the American
Standard Code for information
interchange and there are 256 possible
number two letter conversions in it we
only need 52 of those for the alphabet
26 lower case letters 26 uppercase
letters but there are also spaces
periods parentheses all of the number
signs multiplication division quotes
that sort of thing and then the
remainder are sort of filled out with
special characters that are typically
printed like that new line character
that we've been using escape sequences
for 256 might seem like a lot of rooms
since we're really only using maybe 80
of them but it is not enough to encode
for example all Chinese characters or
idea grams or all of the other scripts
that exist in the world from greek to
cyrillic to tagalog which I believe has
a different alphabets someone will
correct me on this one make it known in
the forums anyway there are a bunch of
different scripts used in natural
languages and there are more than 256
characters in the entire world so the
basic solution is we need more numbers
rather than saying that numbers one
through 256
correspond to letters we'll just decide
to use more room we'll say he'll numbers
between 1 &amp;amp; 65,536 correspond to
correspond to letters maybe the ones at
the beginning correspond to English then
there are some for Greek then there's
some for Russian and it's just a bigger
standard somehow we have to agree on the
order in which they appear and you may
have heard words like Unicode or utf-8
mentioned in this sort of discussion
those are just standards for using
bigger sequences of numbers to represent
letters that occur in the natural
languages throughout the world all right
let's get back now to the meat of the
question how does a web browser like
Firefox handle words written in other
languages especially if you're doing
token definitions or whatnot no
essentially as a convenience feature for
programmers like you we've written out a
through z or a through z capital A
through capital Z to mean I want this to
be a word but often there are special
shortcuts like backslash w which you can
write down kind of like we might write
down backslash n for new line back /w
often means this is a word character and
someone else at the standards committee
once and for all has written down all of
the numbers corresponding to English
letters Cyrillic letters Latin letters
Greek letters all the way on down right
including let's say a bunch of Chinese
Japanese Korean idea grams or letters in
their syllabaries and listed all of the
ones that don't correspond to space or
punctuation in essentially a big lookup
table and then whenever you want to say
I want to get a word in any language you
just refer to something like backslash w
you refer to this lookup table often
provided by a library for you and it
expands under the hood to actually
thousands of individual characters or
character ranges so in practice once
again the answer to this is someone in
one particular standards committee
essentially enumerated every possible
letter every possible script sequence in
all of human natural languages or at
least let's say all of the ones that we
have thus far encountered
and we've written down which of those
correspond to word letters in which of
them corresponds to numbers and then we
provide special shortcuts that you can
use to reference those sets so when a
Firefox developer is writing a regular
expression instead of using a through z
if they mean it's part of a word they'll
use something special like backslash w
and the actual name for this escape
sequence is different depending on which
regular expression library are using but
the basic concepts parentis this group
in + star they stay the same for the
Firefox developers even if you're
supporting multiple international
languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
