work we turn to several optimizations
that help make it fast since mass
storage devices tend to be slow
well first discuss some software
optimizations and then turn to hardware
if your first reaction is let's use a
cache then you're on the right track
indeed most operating systems do use
free portions of main memory as the
cache for the much slower mass storage
device statistics vary on this sort of
thing over time as technologies change
but by most measurements memory is as
much as a hundred thousand times faster
than disk for random access but use the
portion of memory used as the cache for
disk the unified buffer cache a name it
earned for some obscure historical
reasons the terminology here can be a
little confusing so when it emphasized
that we're talking about in-memory
caching of the contents on the disk not
the RAM on the disk controller that the
device controller here it might use when
data is read from disk is stored in this
unified buffer cache so that subsequent
reads can find it there instead of
having to bother the disk again because
disk access is often sequential it is
common also to read ahead in a file
loading up subsequent blocks to main
memory so that is there when the
application needs it
writing the disk is usually done with
the write back policy the change is made
only in the unified buffer cache at
first and the page is marked as dirty
the slower operation of writing the data
to disk is postponed until some more
opportune time new files can also be
created and stored in the unified buffer
cache if a file has a very short
lifespan
rinette disk might not be necessary at
all the existence of the in-memory cache
means that a call to write isn't a
guarantee that the data is changed on
the disk and will persist the changes
are only reflected in memory the
advantage is that the program gets to
resume faster and get on with its work
the downside is that if the system
crashes before the write has been made
to disk then changes will be lost if you
really do want to make sure that changes
are reflected on disk need to call F
sink or M sinks to flush out the unified
buffer cache the write back policy of
the buffer cache is also the reason that
operating systems will warn you not to
remove storage devices without ejecting
them first
it needs a chance to flush the buffer
cache of any dirty pages
so that changes will be reflected on the
device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
