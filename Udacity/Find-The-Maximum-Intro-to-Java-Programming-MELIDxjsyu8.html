largest element in a sequence of inputs
now you might think how hard can this be
in this sequence clearly this one is the
largest but a computer program can't
scan all of the inputs at once like we
can the computer sees items one at a
time so let's look at this problem a
little differently so here I have these
playing cards I get to see one at a time
and I need to find out which one has the
highest value let's look at the first
one that clearly is the largest one I've
seen so far the next one well that one's
larger the next one is even larger this
one here not so much so I won't change
my mind about which one is the largest
that one is larger yet this one isn't as
large as the one over here so I will
ignore it and my last one here is also
smaller so my answer is that the eight
was the largest input in pseudocode the
algorithm would look like this I started
letting largest be the first value while
there are more values I read the next
value and if that value is larger than
what I thought the largest was I changed
my mind when I'm done with this loop
largest will have been set to the very
largest of all of the inputs now you get
to try this out with Java code go ahead
and complete the next project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
