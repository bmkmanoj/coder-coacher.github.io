episode we learned about regular
expressions a concise notation as a way
to write down or denote or match a
number of strings so this four through
seven in brackets corresponds to four
different strings four five six and
seven and we learn to write more
complicated regular expressions like
this one be a plus this plus means one
or more copies of A's yielding words
like ba ba ba and eventually yielding my
sheep and I assert that it's a sheep you
can tell because of the label and those
labels never lie we also learned how you
can use regular expressions in Python by
importing bringing in the functions and
data types from the regular expression
library and an example of such a
function was find all which given a sort
of needle regular expression would
return all of the places in the haystack
that it matched we also learned that you
could turn regular expressions into
finite state machines this finite state
machine accepts the same language as our
bah-bah-bah regular expression from
above starting in the start state on a B
we transition to the middle state on an
a we end up in the third state which is
an accepting state you can tell by the
double circle and then there's a self
loop back and that was last time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
