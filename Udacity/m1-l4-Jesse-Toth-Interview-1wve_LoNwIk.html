ruby developer at github so Jesse when I
was first reading through the Ruby
documentation when I was learning to
code I felt pretty discouraged and I'm
glad that I didn't give up then though
because otherwise I wouldn't have ended
up with this awesome career in
technology so could you share with us a
time or a moment that you felt
discouraged or that maybe you weren't
cut out for this and how did you get
through that oh definitely there's I
mean looking at the Ruby docs myself
there's a lot there and there's no way
to learn all of it at once there are
definitely times where I've been
struggling for almost a whole day to try
to figure out something that in the end
it seemed really simple that I didn't
understand at the time but I had to
struggle through it and learn different
things and along the way I learned about
not just that problem but what was
underneath that problem so when you
encounter a problem you see it more so
as a challenge to overcome rather than
as a oh I messed up right yeah
absolutely it can be frustrating to get
stuck and to feel like you don't know
but once you get past that then you've
learned something and you've added a new
tool to your tool bit that's awesome
we've all got our own personal obstacles
or concerns when learning something new
what are some of yours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
