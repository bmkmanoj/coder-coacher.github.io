took the test could have influenced your
memory if you're taking the test late at
night you might be really tired or maybe
your brain just doesn't work in the
morning like one of my friends he can't
think at all in the morning that isn't
to say that it definitely did influence
your memory but it could have the number
of palm trees in Hawaii isn't very
plausible to have influenced your memory
your stress level definitely could have
influenced your memory if you're really
stressed maybe you don't remember as
well the price of milk not so plausible
the five-minute breaks absolutely if you
didn't take the five-minute breaks my
hunch is that it might be more difficult
to remember which face was from part 1
or part 2 the mass of Pluto not so much
your age definitely and finally not
paying attention definitely could have
influenced your memory and the BBC study
concluded that age and time of day were
the two biggest influencers on how well
people performed on this memory test if
you didn't get a chance to see the BBC
test results so we're looking at a bunch
of different things that could have
influenced your memory including sleep
we make hypotheses all the time every
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
