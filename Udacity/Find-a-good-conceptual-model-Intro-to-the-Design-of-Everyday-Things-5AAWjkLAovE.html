were like we taught years ago while in
school as you can see it explains that
water in the oceans evaporates forms
clouds and then goes back to earth as
rain ice or snow and eventually through
rivers and streams the water goes back
into the ocean this conceptual model is
a highly simplified explanation but for
most purposes its efficient people form
conceptual models all the time and it's
the responsibility of the designer to
help the person form a useful conceptual
model it doesn't have to be complete it
can be an approximation but it has to be
usable in the absence of clues from the
designer the person is very likely to
develop an inaccurate model which means
they will eventually be confused for
your next exercise find a reasonably
complex activity that you frequently do
and explain your conceptual model for it
you may use a combination of texts or
drawings the organization of your
kitchen how you store things in your
room
or the operation of the equipment in
your entertainment center are all good
examples of everyday situations that can
be amazingly difficult to explain to
others you can use one of these examples
or choose one of your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
