ability is np-hard if I give you a
general graph and say can you assign
colors to these nodes so that at most
three colors to these nodes so that no
two nodes that are connected have the
same color answering that yes or no for
all possible graphs is probably
computationally intractable it's as hard
as any problem in NP what does that tell
us about four color ability so I want
you to check all the things that are
true because we know that three color
abilities in NP then for color abilities
in NP because we can quickly verify a
certificate that lists the color
assignments so is that is it true that
for color ability is in it is in NP for
this reason it's not necessarily in NP
because the number of colors is bigger
than in the three color realty case is
it the case that it is not necessarily
NP hard because having four colors to
work with makes things easier so just
because something is hard to color with
three colors it could be quite easy to
color with four colors next no no it is
np-hard because a solution to four color
ability also solves three color ability
and will and the reason for that is we
can just add another node to the graph
connect it to all the other ones and
then try to color that graph and then
finally since any graph that is three
colorable is for colorable the problems
are basically equivalent so it's the
same so check all that apply there are
two of them that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
