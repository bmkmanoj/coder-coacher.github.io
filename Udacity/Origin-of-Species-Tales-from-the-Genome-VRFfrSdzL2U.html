humble our humble beginnings really were
we've used our genomes out to look at
our close and distant relatives to
discover our countries and continents of
origin even trace our maternal and
paternal lines out of Africa but all we
really need to do to see where we've
come from is look at the genomes at some
of our closest living relatives one of
the best-kept genetic secrets is hiding
in your chromosome 2 now humans have 23
pairs of chromosomes and chimpanzees
along with our other clothes primate
relatives like orangutang and gorillas
have 24 pairs of chromosomes now humans
and chimps are cousins we share a common
ancestor now we've also shared a common
habitat in Africa for a very long time
we look alike we act alike and new tools
are showing us every day how we even
think alike but if we're so similar to
chimpanzees then why don't we have the
same number of chromosomes there's an
actual picture from an actual experiment
where somebody used a probe a label to
look in the genome of a human and a
great ape these are all the chromosomes
and in green here they've painted the
chromosomes that have sequences from our
human chromosome 2 and you can see this
chromosome lit up in green here that's
nice and long and in the picture of the
great ape we see the same chromosome lit
up in green because it has the same
sequences but notice that we have twice
as many chromosomes and they're smaller
if we were to actually look at the
sequence of our chromosome 2 it matches
the sequence of two smaller chimp
chromosomes we can even line them up
side-by-side and see which of the chimp
chromosomes go in which order for our
human chromosome to humans and chimps
shared a common ancestor that lived
about six to eight million years ago and
this common ancestor likely had 24 pairs
of chromosomes just like all the other
great apes orangutans gorillas chimps
and then the population was separated by
the Great Rift Valley in East Africa
where the population on the west side
remained in the forest and evolved as
chimps while the population on the east
side was pushed into the savanna and
expiry
is to chromosomal fusion during the
evolution to humans now you may find a
profound connection to parents and
siblings and grandparents and even great
grandparents and cousins but I hope you
take a second to just sit and think and
share a deep appreciation for the
connection that you have with your even
more distant cousin the chimpanzee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
