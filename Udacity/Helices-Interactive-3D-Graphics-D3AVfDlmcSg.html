that's very useful in computer graphics
you could compute both the top and
bottom locations in the loop for
capsules however a better method is to
initially compute the bottom location
and then on each iteration compute only
the top position at the end of the loop
you then set this top position into the
bottom now bottom is set for the next
loop iteration the only other clever bit
of code here is the realization that the
bottom sphere needs to be on for only
the first capsule in a string after that
I set open bottom to true so that it's
never output again for this helix if you
want to take this exercise to the next
level rewrite the code so that the
cylinder and sphere geometry is reused
throughout the helix right now no
instancing is done so it's a memory hog
every capsule creates its own geometry
another extension is to allow the art
parameter to be a floating point number
so that you could generate just part of
an arc if you really want to play around
try adding factors to have the helix
become a larger and larger spiral or
have the radius vary with height as a
sine curve me I find that once I start
playing with procedural modeling that
it's hard to stop if you make something
great consider submitting it to the 3gs
library itself for inclusion as a demo
you can use github to make submissions
