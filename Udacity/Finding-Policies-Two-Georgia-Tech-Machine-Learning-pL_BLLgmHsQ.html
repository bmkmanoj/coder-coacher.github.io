by looking at the utilities of all the
other states including itself as Prime
and wait those based on my probability
of getting there given that I took an
action and what action I'm going to take
while I'm gonna take the one that
maximizes my expected utility so sort of
like put you know figuring out what to
do in a state assuming that this U hat
really is the right answer for the
future right now why is that gonna work
so I just made up the U hats right they
started out as arbitrary utilities the
next little step about updating
utilities based on neighbors make some
sense because effectively a neighbor is
any state that you can reach which is
determined by the transition function
but all I'm doing is reaching states
that are also made up of arbitrary
utilities so arbitrary values why should
that help me well it's because of this
value right here this is actual truth
the actual word that I get for entering
into a state is a true value so
effectively what's gonna happen is I'm
gonna be propagating out the true value
or true reward the true immediate reward
that I get for entering into a state say
through all of the states that I'm going
to see and propagating that information
back and forth until ultimately I
converge it's still not obvious why we
should converge because we start off
with an arbitrary function and it seems
like that could be really wrong
so we're like adding truth to wrong yes
but then the next time around I'm gonna
have been adding truth twice to wrong
and then more truth to wrong and more
true the wrong and eventually I'm going
to be adding more and more and more and
more and more and more and more and more
truth and it will overwhelm the original
wrong and is that does it help that the
wrong is being discounted yes it helps
what the wrong is being discounted
doesn't help the wrong is being
accounted uh I actually don't know that
that matters have to think about that
for a moment it certainly doesn't hurt
but I guess the way that I think about
this I mean there's an actual proof you
can look it up but but in the end I
think I tend to think of this as a kind
of a simple contraction proof that
effectively at every step you have to be
moving towards the answer because you've
added in more of the reality more of the
truth and if you remember the utility of
a state
it's just all the rewards that you're
gonna see so basically at every time
step you've added the reward that you're
going to see and then all the rewards
you're gonna see after that and so
you've gotten a better estimate of
actually the sequence or rewards you're
likely to see from a state and if that
gets better for any of the states then
eventually that bitterness will
propagate out to all the other states
that they can reach or they can reach
them and that'll just keep happening and
you'll keep getting closer and closer
and closer for the true utility of the
states until eventually you run out of
closeness cool does that make sense at
all well so does it also help that the
gamma is less than 1 yeah it does
the the way I like to think of this as
this as a sort of contraction proof that
if you've heard of those so the basic
idea here is that you start out with
some noise but at every step you're
getting some truth and that truth gets
added and then the next iteration more
truth gets added and more truths get
gets added so as you have some estimate
of some particular state s you get to
update it based on truth its actual
reward and you bring in more truth from
the other utilities as well as this
particular utility gets better that
closeness to the true utility then gets
spread to all front to all the states
that can reach it and because the gamma
is less than 1 you basically get to
overwhelm the past in this case which is
the original arbitrary utilities and so
as you keep iterating through this the
latest truth becomes more important than
the past less truth and so you're always
getting closer and closer and closer to
the truth until eventually you do at
least that's the intuition that I like
to think of yeah I could I kind of get
that as an intuition though I'd probably
be happier going through the math but
well we could do that and by we I mean
the students can do that by actually
reading the proof all right ok so cool
so this right here is a an easy way to
find the true value of states and you do
it by iterating and it kind of has a
name it kind of has a name yeah what do
you think the knellman don't know
Velvets algorithm no though that's
probably reasonable utility iteration
yes except utility
sounds better if you say value so it's
value iteration and it works remarkably
well so and it doesn't get doesn't give
you the answer but it gets you something
that's closer and closer to the answer
right and eventually will converge or
get so close to converging it doesn't
matter and once you have the two
utilities if you recall we know how to
define the optimal policy in terms of
the utilities so if I give you the
utilities then the optimum policy is
just well I'm in a state look at all the
states I might get to figure out the
expectation that I'm gonna get for a
given action pick whichever one is
maximal and I'm done so solving for the
utilities or the true value of a state
is effectively the same thing as solving
for the optimal policy excellent that's
cool
I think so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
