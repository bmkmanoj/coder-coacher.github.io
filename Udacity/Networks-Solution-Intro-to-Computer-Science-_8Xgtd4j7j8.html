humans have been using networks like
this since at least as long as we can
record they might have just been
networks where people talk to each other
but even networks where they were using
technology to communicate in this way go
back at least 3,000 years so to give you
an idea of how sophisticated networks
could be over 3,000 years ago here's a
quote from Homer's The Iliad where he's
talking about the network the ancient
Greeks had and they had a line of
beacons spread over the Greek islands
they could use that to send messages to
warn the neighboring islands when there
was an enemy attacking and that would
tell them to bring in their ships that
troubles about to occur and Homer was
writing this around 800 BC but what we
was describing were wars that happened
over 3,000 years ago and Homer wasn't
just making this up the Greeks actually
had such a network they had a network
where soldiers could light a fire on one
Island and soldiers on another Island
would see that fire light their own fire
that would send a signal to the next
island the next Island would see that
and light its own fire and they could
send messages over great distances this
way they could send a message over 600
kilometers across the Greek islands so
what do you need to make a network like
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
