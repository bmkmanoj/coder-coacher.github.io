introduce now is default parameters
default parameters allow us to have
parameters that don't necessarily need
to be passed in this is very handy so
here's an example to illustrate the
value of default parameters remember
that we define the dish class and its
initializer takes three parameters in
addition to the self object a name a
price and description but there's some
dishes that are so famous that they
don't need a description either that or
they defy description so suppose that
applies to our bodacious burger we could
pass in none or some empty string or
some other value but really we don't
want to pass another thing we don't want
to have a description that's okay if we
just have one parameter that we don't
care about but suppose we have lots of
them then we might end up needing to do
something like this we've got one two
three four parameters we don't care
about we got to remember to have those
and then we've got one that we do care
about say that is the number of side
dishes that comes with a bodacious
burger and we want that type of value
three and then we've got to remember
another one that we don't care about
this gets to be pretty unwieldy the way
we're gonna avoid this is to give
default values for the parameters and
then we only have to pass in the ones
that are different from the default
values the way to do this is quite
simple for each parameter that we want
to have a default value like the
description parameter we just add an
assignment giving it the value that we
want it to have so the description
parameter will have a default value none
if we don't pass in a description it
will have the value none if we pass it
in it will have the value that we pass
then we can use a net like this creating
new instances of the dish class only
passing in parameters whose value
differs from the default value we always
have to pass in the name and price
because they have no default value and
those are the first two in both calls
here but otherwise we don't have to pass
in anything else unless we want to value
different from the default value like we
do here with the broccoli burger which
is vegetarian the default value is false
for the bodacious burger we didn't pass
in any value for vegetarian that means
it'll have the default value which is
false and it's highly non recommended
for vegetarians</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
