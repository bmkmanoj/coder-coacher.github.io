tasked with writing the lexer for a new
programming language there are seven
types of tokens and four of which are
simple operators we have plus minus x
and divided so here ever in the token
rule for the plus operator the first
line is a regular expression that
matches the plus symbol and then
returned the token unchanged and for the
rest of the operators we're going to
follow that same format we're just going
to change the name of the function and
we're going to change the symbol to
which it matches our next token is the
identifier in our programming language
this will be the names that we have for
things so it can be something like my
underscore variable or something even
more interesting like just the word Andy
more precisely in our program language
and identifier is a non-empty sequence
of letters and underscores where the
first character is not underscore so we
can write our rule for that pretty
simply here of a function t underscore
the dent and the regular expression is
pretty simple the first character and
has to be at least one character because
it's a non empty string it's just going
to be some bladder and then we're going
to be followed by zero or more letters
or underscores so strings in this
language are very similar to the strings
in Python we can have single or double
quotes but in this particular language
for which we are designing our lecture
we don't have any escape sequences this
actually makes the expression to match
the strings much simpler so the first
room writing is just for single quoted
strings the rule for double quote is
during this is going to be very similar
it's just the derive expression to which
we're matching is going to be slightly
different when I go over the code at the
end and I show you the finished product
I'll show you what that looks like but
for now let's just concentrate on single
quoted strings here I require that the
string begins and ends with a single
quote and is a sequence of zero or more
became an empty string characters that
aren't the single quote since we don't
have xscape characters that's all we
need so here I'm taking out the quotes
from the beginning into the string that
way the value of this token is the
string itself and I'm setting the type
to string all caps numbers in this
language are a little bit different than
Python first off the only numbers we
have are positive integers so negative 5
and 5.5 are both not valid numbers in
this language so one example of a good
one would be five we're also allowed to
put underscores anywhere in the number
as long as it's not the first character
in the number so five underscore five
triple underscore is going to be
equivalent to just 55 a lot of languages
actually have this feature because it's
easier to read one two three underscore
four five six similar to how we often
put 123456 so here I've started writing
out the token role for numbers in this
language the first character has to be a
digit in zero through nine and
afterwards we can have zero or more
digits or underscores now we want the
value of the number token to be the
number the integer that it represents
however if we just return the string or
try to call some integer conversion on
it we're just going to get a lot of
underscores and it's not really going to
work and it's not what we want we want
to take five underscore five triple
underscore and just get 55 so my
strategy is going to be to go through
each character in our string append any
digits to a new string ignore in the
underscores and once I'm done call int
onto that string to get the integer that
the original token represented so here I
have the finished function one go
through each character like I planned if
it's not an underscore I'm going to
append it onto our temp string and then
call ants on that temp string to get the
new value and here I have the finished
code we have our basic operators plus
minus x and divided the identifier
function we wrote single and double
strings really the only difference here
is that we have single quotes right here
double quotes right there and lastly the
number token function that we were</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
