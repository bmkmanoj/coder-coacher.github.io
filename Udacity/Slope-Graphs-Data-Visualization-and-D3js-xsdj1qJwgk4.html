you have any examples of a visualization
where you think this was a great story
this told a really amazing story yeah
one that struck me relatively recently
is the slope graph that's on the cover
of Alberto Cairo's book so here what
we've got plotted is on the left hand
side the percent of higher educated
population by state and then on the
right hand side the percent obese again
by state and then a given state's
connected by the line which allows you
to see relatively quickly the sort of
inverse relationship here across the
blue states and positive relationship
here in the red states and it can allow
you to really in a straight program
manner without really having to explain
too much about it get an understanding
and pick out interesting things and
again start to form that story or
narrative this was actually the first
time I encountered a slope graph or at
least the first time that one stuck with
me and I found it inspiring because
there are actually a lot of different
use cases for graphs like this which I
hadn't really anticipated because you're
really only plotting two data points
right yeah
one way is you know to look at things
over time and again with only two data
points you'd think that's not so
interesting but depending on your data
it can be or also the comparison of
groups so for example here in this slope
graph I'm plotting feedback from an
employee survey where on the left hand
side we have the percent favorable you
know a summary metric for the survey for
the overall company and on the right
hand side for a given team you knows
could be your engineering organization
for example and you can see really
quickly a whole lot of things right so
on the left hand side you get the
absolute values you get the relative
rank ordering of the different
dimensions you get those things on the
right hand side as well and then via the
slope of the lines here you get the
percent difference between the groups
without ever having to explain what a
percent difference is so it's just a
really efficient form of communication
for the right circumstance
that's great when I look at this graph
one of my key takeaways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
