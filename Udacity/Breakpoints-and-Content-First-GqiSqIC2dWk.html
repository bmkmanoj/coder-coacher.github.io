issues by practicing adaptive design
let's start by talking about the when of
adaptive design or at what points do you
want to begin adapting your UI the basic
idea of adaptive design is that you
change your UI based on the screen size
that is your UI adapts to the amount of
horizontal or vertical space that you
have we do this by introducing what we
call break points break points are the
points at which your UI changes for
example you could show another column of
content once your screen width is 600
dip or larger 600 dip is therefore a
breakpoint in your UI now you might be
wondering how should I choose these
break points well the material spec
identifies some common break points well
you can start with these it's important
to ensure your breakpoints make sense
for your content it's important to think
content first you can then think of the
break points as the point in which your
UI literally breaks for the content it's
trying to present so what does it mean
to be content first in this case it
means starting by fuking out what the
constraints are for your content and
then figuring out the break points from
that let's return to some of the layouts
we looked at in Lesson one and see how
they might work on larger devices now as
the screen width increases with this
layout the line length or text increase
is making it harder to read so you might
want to have a break point somewhere
where the line length exceeds 45 to 75
character guideline in this form layout
on wider devices there's too much unused
space here on the right making it feel
very unbalanced you might set a
breakpoint roundabout say here to
rebalance the layout in this example see
how these two buttons take up half the
width of the screen on why delay arts
this starts to get quite awkward around
about say this point so that might be a
break point also notice how maintaining
a constant height and center crop image
starts to break down on larger sizes it
ends up showing this kind of small
sliver of the whole image greatly blown
up lastly the left aligned content can
start to feel unbalanced leave
large empty areas on the right of the
screen choosing break points based on
content requirements is more future
proof than basing them on a specific set
of devices you'll know those
requirements will be satisfied no matter
what devices get thrown your way okay so
now that we know we want to do something
different when a UI gets to these
breakpoint sizes in the next section
we'll talk about how you do this with
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
