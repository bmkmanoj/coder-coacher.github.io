we're in chart state zero when we
haven't seen any of the input yet we
started in position 0 there's no hidden
input we're missing there's no
processing that we've already done and
even as we move initially into this
first state in chart position one we've
seen one token and look there's one
token to the left of this dot we got
here by reading in the input left
parenthesis from chart position 0 0 we
were expecting a left parenthesis great
I just move my finger over to the right
so essentially I copy this previous rule
p goes to dot open p close starting at
zero and i bring it down here into chart
one but now i have the dot i have my
finger before p if i'm expecting to see
a pea in the future i could see another
open parenthesis because that's one of
the things that p can rewrite to I could
also see nothing because that's another
thing that coupee could be rewritten to
so I've included both of those they're
right here one two based on this rule
and this p12 brought those two in I
brought them in based on thinking hard
about chart one and they assume that
I've already seen this left parenthesis
these two rules start at position one
since one of the things I'm considering
is that p is totally empty up here I was
thinking oh I could have seen a left
parenthesis and been expecting a pee and
then a right parenthesis but if P
disappears then I'm already past it and
I'm expecting a right parenthesis so I
got this from this rule up here which
came from chart position 0 now we just
so happen to know what the actual next
piece of input was we saw an open
parenthesis and then another open
parenthesis so it must have been that we
were looking at this very special rule
right here we saw the open parenthesis
and this one was right and all of the
others were wrong they were
possibilities but they didn't pan out so
we took this rule here and move our
finger over shift it past this open
parenthesis so we get open parenthesis
dot P close that's right where we
started here so I was bringing over this
rule that had previously said starting
at one it still says starting at one but
now I do the trick and this is the part
where the numbers change if my dot is
right in front of a pea then I could be
expecting to see a left parenthesis
we're not going to in the input but you
never know or nothing so once again
based on this p i'm going to start
bringing in rules one and two p goes to
dot open p close p goes to nothing but
this time we started in position to this
was a very tricky quiz you should not
feel bad if elements of this gave you
grief we're going to go over this in
much more detail later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
