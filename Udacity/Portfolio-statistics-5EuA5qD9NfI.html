prices to port Val which is the daily
total value of the portfolio now that we
have port Val we can compute a number of
important statistics on the portfolio
and thus assess the portfolio and the
investment style of whoever's managing
that portfolio an important first
calculation is to compute daily returns
we've talked about how to do that before
so I won't go over it here but an
important observation is whenever you
compute daily returns the first value is
always going to be zero and that's
because on the first day of course
there's no change so we want to exclude
that value from any calculations we do
across all daily returns it's easy to
accomplish this with a simple Python
statement which is just to replace daily
returns with daily returns where we just
include the second row forward and boom
we're rid of that first zero now that we
have this information we can compute
four key statistics that everybody wants
to know about regarding the performance
of a portfolio they are cumulative
return average daily return standard
deviation of daily return and Sharpe
ratio the cumulative return is just a
measure of how much the value of the
portfolio has gone up from the beginning
to the end so to calculate that we take
the last vowel which is port Val of
minus 1 which is this one divide it by
the beginning and subtract one average
daily return is just the average of
these numbers so we just take the mean
very simple and standard deviation of
daily return again simple just use the
standard deviation function right there
now Sharpe ratio is a little bit more
complex than these other ones so we're
going to spend a little bit more time
diving into Sharpe ratio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
