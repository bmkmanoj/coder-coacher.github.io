for escaping the characters in the
parameters of our URL to make sure that
none of the characters were unsafe ASCII
now our method worked but Apple actually
provides a set of classes that we can
use to accomplish the exact same thing
the first of these classes that we're
going to talk about is nsurl components
nsurl components is a class designed to
help us build URLs in a piecewise
fashion that is to say that a URL can be
built from individual pieces or
components if we look at URLs more
closely we can start to see some of
these common components here's a URL for
a web page that has information about
Udacity z-- nano degree programs we can
actually omit the www portion it isn't
required and we could focus on the rest
the first part of the URL called the
scheme specifies the protocol that we're
using in this case the scheme we're
using is HTTPS next the part menu refer
to as the website name here at Udacity
comm is called the hostname or host for
short the host is used to determine the
location of the server the final part of
this URL is called the path it specifies
the location on the server where the
resources that we want is located in
this case we want the resource located
at the path nanodegree and like we said
before the resource at this location is
a web page that has information about
Udacity Szanto degree programs using
nsurl components we can create this URL
in just a few lines of code and you can
see here in this code example that I've
had to use the slash character in the
path that is required so it may not look
the exact same on the previous screen
that we saw but you'll need to provide
the slash here but what about a more
complex URL like the ones we'll be using
and flick finder here's another example
this URL uses the Flickr api's Flickr
photos dot search method and just so you
know I've omitted some of the parameters
in this particular example for brevity
we can go ahead and label the scheme the
host and the path but what do we call
everything else
well the question mark separates the
path from the next component in this URL
that's called the query the query is
composed of named
you pairs that a server can use to
determine its response you'll notice
that each pair is separated by an
ampersand to add the query component to
a URL using nsurl components we need to
introduce a new class called nsurl query
item the nsurl query item represents a
single name value pair in the query
component of a URL to create an nsurl
query item is pretty straightforward
we just need to specify the name and the
value then nsurl components has a
property called query items which is an
array of NS URL query item so we can
just add any query items that we make to
this array in code it might look
something like this if we go over here
we can see the resulting URL and I know
this might seem like a lot of work just
to create a URL but the big trade-off is
that nsurl components takes care of
ensuring that our urls are properly
escaped and only contains safe ASCII
characters and that's a nice reassurance
for us let's take a look at one final
example this URL is taken from Matt
Thompson's post on nsurl components on
NS hipster I've posted a link to the
article in the instructor notes now in
first glance this URL is a lot to take
in but it just contains some extra
optional components of a URL
they're already labeled here and if
you're interested I encourage you to
