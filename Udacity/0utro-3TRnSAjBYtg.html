finish line and covered a ton of ground
in this course we've learned about focus
semantics aria and styling and how they
all fit into the week AG and web and
checklists these are really important
tools in our accessibility tool belt but
it can be easy to get caught up in the
low level implementation details and
forget that accessibility is really all
about making sure all of your users can
access your content throughout the
course we met some users with various
forms of impairments including Laura a
program manager on Chrome who has low
vision add a software engineer with
motor impairment geo Tina who is blind
and manages a team of test engineers Sam
a recruiter at Google who's also death
and of course our good friend Victor who
is a blind technical program manager
working across several product areas
it's important to remember that no
matter what your product is there's a
whole range of users out there not just
the narrow spectrum that we might be
designing for building only for that
subset of users is excluding not only
anyone with a permanent disability or
impairment but also means our product
may fail any user when they're in a
context which impacts the way that they
use technology such as trying to use a
phone one handed while wrangling a
screaming toddler so having empathy is a
huge part of creating an accessible
product another really important aspect
is to make a part of the process from
the beginning and make it part of
everyone's job and by that we mean
everyone developers obviously have a
really important role to play in making
sure that we implement interface it in a
way which maximizes accessibility and
takes advantage of the HTML platform but
designers also have a responsibility to
ensure that accessibility is considered
from the beginning both in terms of
ensuring that the visual design is
accessible as robe laid out in this
lesson but also considering keyboard
usability and semantics and labeling and
project or product managers have a
responsibility to ensure the
accessibility is a blocking criterion
for launch and to make sure that it's
scheduled appropriately however all of
that is a best case scenario we know the
real world is messier than that so what
can we do to try and make things better
right away remediating accessibility
like anytime you're trying to reduce the
number of bugs in your software is best
looked at through the lens of impact how
can you
the most impact on users with the least
amount of effort and this boils down to
you three main things first how
frequently is this piece of view I used
is it a critical part of the application
like the sign in form or something that
might be a handy feature but less
commonly used second how badly does this
accessibility issue affect our users for
example is it something which is just
going to stop screen reader users in
their tracks or is it something which
maybe is annoying but can be worked
around and finally how expensive is it
going to be to fix this issue could we
fix three other critical accessibility
bugs in the time it takes to fix this
one in the end the only true measure of
accessibility is where the users can use
our products well designed and built
products are going to work for a very
broad range of users in a very broad
range of situations so ultimately good
accessibility equals good UX and making
a part of your process is going to
benefit everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
