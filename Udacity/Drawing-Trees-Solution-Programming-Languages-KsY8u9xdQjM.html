it i'm just going to review the three
rules that talk about these trees all of
the left children of a node are less
than or equal to it all of the right
children of node are greater than or
equal to it and both of the children
should follow rules one through three as
well this is a recursive data structure
so let's take a look at this first
option here on the left what could go in
this box well since it's a right child
of this node labeled one by rule number
two we know that it has to be greater
than or equal to one and since its
eventually reachable on the left from
three we know that it's less than or
equal to 3 so the only thing I could
things I could put in this box are one
two or three not seven it can't hold
seven because it has to be less than or
equal to 3 so this one won't work out
for us by this same sort of reasoning
let's take a look at this box we know it
has to be greater than or equal to 3
because it's to the right of this three
node but less than or equal to 5 so for
would be a great thing to put there but
seven doesn't fit down here we're
getting a little bit closer this node
has to be less than or equal to 6 but
also greater than or equal to 5 this is
a little harder to see in the picture
but starting from 5s right child I can
eventually get down here this is greater
than or equal to 5 so maybe 5.5 could go
in there but not 7 over here oh I'm
getting excited now we need something
since I can reach it going to the left
of 8 I need something less than or equal
to 8 and something greater than or equal
to 6 7 seems like a perfect thing to put
here so I could definitely add 7 to this
part of my tree both of these would have
to be greater than or equal to 8 so
they're not good answers for seven now
let's take a look at this evil box up
here at the top we've been describing
trees with exactly two branches we've
been talking about the left child and
the right child i drew this mysterious
third branch coming off of 5 and i drew
it in the picture to the right so you
might be tempted to think oh this has to
be a little better than 5 and a little
less than eight so seven would be
perfect but in fact the sort of
recursive data structure weird
vibing allows exactly or up to two
children so it'd be very tempting to put
a seven there but that's not the kind of
data structure we're describing now
don't feel bad if this one seemed very
tempting to you it's entirely possible
to make trees like this that have three
children every time or a variable number
of children every time but the practice
problems i'm going to be going over
require 10 or two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
