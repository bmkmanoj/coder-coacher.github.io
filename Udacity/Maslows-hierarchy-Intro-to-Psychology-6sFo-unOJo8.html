gonna discuss was developed by Abraham
Maslow Maslow developed the model of
motivation in which he termed the
hierarchy of needs this hierarchy of
needs states that we progress or move on
to higher needs once the more basic
needs are relatively well satisfied
otherwise we stay concerned with the
more basic level needs here look at this
model for example if we're dying of
hunger we're not concerned with beauty
or aesthetics but only with getting food
at the most basic level of needs we need
to fill our physiological needs these
are things such as the need for food
water or oxygen or even an adequate body
temperature these are our basic needs in
order to survive then once we have our
physiological needs met we can move on
to the next level of the pyramid and
that's need for safety and security
safety needs are things such as having
security protection stability and also
not being exposed to things such as
terrorism war or fighting on the third
level is our need for love and
belongingness according to Maslow the
third level includes things such as our
desire to belong to our family or belong
to our social groups we'll discuss a
need for belonging in more detail a
little later on in the lesson the next
level is our self esteem needs and this
is the need to appreciate ourselves and
our worth here we want to be appreciated
and respected by others finally at the
top of the hierarchy of needs is
self-actualization or the inherent drive
to realize once full potential
or one's abilities in life but because
this is at the top of the hierarchy it's
the hardest to achieve because all of
our other needs need to be satisfied
first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
