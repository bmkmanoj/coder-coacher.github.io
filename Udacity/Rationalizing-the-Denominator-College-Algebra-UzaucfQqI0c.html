in this case as it did when we were
working with complex numbers both cases
make use of this reverse property of the
difference of squares now similar to how
we end up with a real number if we
square an imaginary number when we
square a number that has a square root
sign over it we end up with just the
number that's under the root in other
words a rational number instead of an
irrational number this is really useful
well we might call the conjugate of this
denominator here 1 minus the square root
of two we can find by just switching the
sign here in the middle so that gives us
1 plus the square root of two we know we
don't want to change the value of this
over here so we need to multiply it by
one in the form of 1 plus the square
root of 2 over 1 plus the square root of
two let's do some math and see what that
gives us we can find our new numerator
by just distributing the 6 to both terms
here so we have 6 plus 6 times the
square root of two the denominator ends
up looking pretty simple to our first
term is 1 and then since 1 times the
root of 2 is canceled out by a negative
root 2 we don't have any a key middle
terms that's exactly what we saw up here
with the difference of squares then we
just have negative square root of two
times square root of 2 which means we're
just subtracting the square root of 2
squared that means our denominator is
really just 1-2 now 1-2 is just negative
1 that means that all this really is is
the numerator multiplied or divided by
negative 1 that means our final answer
is just negative 6 minus 6 times the
square root of two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
