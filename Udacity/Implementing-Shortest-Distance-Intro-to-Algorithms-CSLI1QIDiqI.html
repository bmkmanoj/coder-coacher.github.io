it it would be helpful to go back and
take a quick look at the algorithm so
there's really two little blocks of
things that are going on there's for
each node we check all of its neighbors
and once you add that up over all
possible nodes what are all the
neighbors of all the nodes that's M so
and it's constant work for each of those
edges but for each of the node we also
have to do this shortest distance so far
operation and also the remove the
shortest distance so far operation and
so that is for each node it has to do
this which using the implementation that
we're looking at is another n however
the number of edges is always going to
be between 0 and N squared roughly so
this quantity really is somewhere
between N squared and 2n squared all of
that is big theta of N squared so going
back to the set of choices big theta of
N squared is what we're looking for now
that's a larger running time than most
of the things we've looked at so far and
in fact we can do better and I'm hoping
that you've already made the realization
that if you've got a bunch of values and
the two things you want to do with them
is well more than two things you want to
be able to find the smallest you want to
be able to delete the smallest and you
want to be able to take a value that's
already in there and possibly change it
to some other value that seems like the
sort of things that a heap would be
really good at all right so let's
actually figure out how we can use a
heap in this particular algorithm to get
a better running time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
