conversation going on between a psychic
and a detective to solve a murder
mystery and the psychic you know the
detective is is at a dead end and can't
figure out how to solve the murder
mystery and the psychic has this this
sort of amazing leap oh you need to
check the fingerprints on the body and
it's maybe not that amazing of a leap
and you'll find that the murderer is
Smith now we wouldn't arrest someone
based on just the word of the psychic
this detective now actually needs to go
and check it out and see that it
actually is true and assuming that that
is you know that the psychic is giving
checkable information and it's correct
then then the two of them together
should be able to solve the problem now
the role of the psychic here is actually
depict the accepting certificate I don't
know out of thin air somehow just just
guess it and then the verification
algorithm actually can check it this
actually explains this this notion of
guessing a certificate pulling it out of
thin air is not a deterministic process
it's not something that we could just
program an algorithm to do to just jump
right to the right answer and that makes
it a non-deterministic step it's not the
kind of thing that you could actually
write into a program that proceed step
by step by step by step it sort of makes
this crazy leap nondeterministic Lee and
as long as we can check that that leap
is correct with a verification algorithm
we can at least conceptualize that this
is a way of solving problems we can't
actually implement a computer like this
but we can imagine a computer that we
call a non-deterministic computer a
non-deterministic Turing machine that
could do this sort of magical step and
that's where NP gets its name
non-deterministic polynomial time now
just as a quick aside there actually are
some researchers working on something
like this there's reasons to believe
that a quantum computer can do certain
kinds of guessing essentially by in
parallel kind of imagining all the
different situations that all those
different say certificates that might
exist and then designing the algorithm
in such a way that the correct
certificate will actually bubble up to
the top and then efficiently this
doesn't exist yet so don't get worried
that what you're learning in computer
science is all completely irrelevant
it's still relevant for as far as we can
tell into the future
but the idea of a quantum computer is
actually very interesting and we have
reason to believe that the design and
analysis of algorithms for quantum
computer are going to lean pretty
heavily on the stuff that we do for
classical computers as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
