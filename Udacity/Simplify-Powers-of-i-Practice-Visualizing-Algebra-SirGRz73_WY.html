you found those we know our pattern of I
repeats every fourth power so we want to
take this power 21 and / for doing so we
get 5 remainder 1 this means I to the
21st power is equivalent to I to the one
which we know is really just I for the
second one will take the power of 11 and
divided by 4 which is to remainder 3 so
we know I to the 11th is equivalent to I
to the third which equals negative I
since I to the 48th is a multiple of 4
we end up on a power of I to the 4th
which is really just one when thinking
about it with a remainder we know 48 / 4
equals 12 or major 0 I to the 48th is
equal I to the 0 which equals 1 and
finally for I to the 66 we divide the
power bi for to get 16 remainder to this
means that we cycle through the patterns
of I 16 times and then wind up with AI
squared which is equal to negative 1 if
this is still giving you trouble try
repeating these values all the way up
through I to the 11th you'll start
seeing the pattern repeat and hopefully
you'll catch the hang of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
