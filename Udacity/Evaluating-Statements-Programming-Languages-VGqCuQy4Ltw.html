one possible answer together we're
trying to write a program to interpret
if-then-else statements and the big
concept here about control flow is that
we don't want to execute both the then
branch and also the else branch instead
we'll have to pick one so the first
thing I'm going to do is evaluate the
conditional expression in the same
environment in the same set of
valuations two variables that we
currently have if it comes out true I'll
want to execute the then statements if
it comes out false I'll want to execute
the else statements and if you like this
if statement is the same as one where I
check to see if the result of evaluating
the expression is equal to true but if
you have a little experience with
propositional logic that's actually the
same as just checking the value of this
variable directly so if the conditional
expression evaluates to true I will
evaluate all of the statements in the
then branch in our running example that
was a and B in our current environment
there haven't been any intervening
assignment statements so the value of
the variables hasn't changed otherwise
if the value of the conditional
expression wasn't true presumably it was
false we'll go over here to the else
branch evaluate the else statements in
the same environment and note that no
matter what happens we're either
evaluating the then statements or the
else statements but not both and that
decision is made based on the value of
the conditional expression and that's it
these four lines to Feiss to evaluate
and if then else statement in JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
