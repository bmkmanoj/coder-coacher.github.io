dimensional analysis which is a tool we
mentioned briefly in the unit to do some
basic analysis of two fairly advanced
physics equations here we have equals MC
squared
1:09 stands famous equations which
relates mass and energy energy isn't
something we've talked about in class
yet but with dimensional analysis you
don't need to know what energy is to be
able to quantify its units and the way
we do dimensional analysis was we
realized we can write the units of just
about any physical quantity in terms of
mass length and time so mass raised to
some power length to some power and time
to some power so using your knowledge
that M is unit of mass and C is a unit
of velocity or speed you should be able
to figure out what the units of energy
are even if you don't know what it is
yet that will be step one but what I
really want you to do and what I want
you to solve for this problem I want you
to tell me the units of this number H
bar and H bar is a number that shows up
in quantum mechanics which is a
fascinating field of physics all the
time so even if you have no idea what
some of these symbols mean there's
actually still a lot you can learn about
this equation let's take a look at this
term for example well there's a lot
going on in this term but a lot of it
doesn't affect the actual units of
what's happening so for example I'll
have to pay attention to this guy at all
this is the Greek letter sy and it's
dimensionless so we can ignore it these
DS are just some instructions of some
math to do so actually we don't have to
pay attention to those either the
negative sign doesn't really matter and
the two doesn't matter either
so what we're left with is this this is
the relevant part to this equation unit
wise well we have H bar squared well for
something with units of mass times X
which is length squared if we know that
this whole term has units of energy then
what are the units of h-bar we know we
can write it as mass to the something L
to the something and T to the something
I've called those some things a b and c
entering your answers here one of the
points of this problem is to show you
that even with very complicated physics
there's some very simple analysis that
we already have the tools to do now if
you're having trouble solving this one
don't worry it's another tricky question
so as always go to the forums for help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
