Marvel data as a bipartite graph and
then to build the character by character
graph and then find the top-k strengths
and I just reuse the heap code from the
last unit to do that the new part to
focus on is right here so it goes like
this what we do is we loop through all
the different characters in the list of
characters and for each character look
at all the different books where that
character appears then look at all the
characters appearing in those books and
for each of those cut ripples right so
this is a character the books for that
character and the characters for that
book including the character itself by
the way it's going to make a link from
the first character to the second
character oh and this this make a link I
modified this make link so that if you
make a link twice it just keeps account
and so that's going to keep a measure of
the total strength between character 1
and character too so so really if you
think about what it's doing here is
actually for each pair character one
character to it's going to add one each
time there's a book they have in common
so it's going to count up the number of
books in common between character and
one and character too which is really
just what we wanted but it's done in
terms of a triply nested loop here the
running time here has to do with the
number of edges right it's not actually
that the product of the nodes times the
notes times the nodes though if it's a
completely correct connected graph it
will be but if it's a sparse graph for
each character we're only going to list
the edges that come out of that so when
I actually execute this one of the
things we see is that this computer is
faster than my laptop I had a factor of
two so it's me point five to read the
graph but anyway it reads the graph
pretty quickly it computes all those
strengths which is the part that we're
focusing on here in just a couple
seconds and then it runs through the
characters that are connected to other
characters and finds the top ten and I'm
not a comic book expert but I know
enough to actually recognize a couple of
the things that are going on here just
from recent movies you can see that
there's a very strong connection between
the human torch and the thing these are
both members of the Fantastic Four i'm
going to say half of the members of
Fantastic Four here's another one mr.
fantastic and I think the Invisible
Woman is the other one so what we see
here is that books that have the human
torch will often also have the thing in
them and so forth so that all the
different pairings of the Fantastic Four
end up having very high weight they have
a lot of books where they all appear
together similarly spider-man appears
very often with
pretty sure that's his grandmother and
also with his editor because Peter
Parker is a reporter so his editor J
jonah Jameson shows up in a lot of books
with him Captain America shows up with
Tony Stark and I don't think I would
know that one at all except there's a
current movie out that has them together
and I think it's because they're both
Avengers so their individual characters
but they also appear together often and
I have no idea who vision and Scarlet
Witch ARF but I'm sure they're awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
