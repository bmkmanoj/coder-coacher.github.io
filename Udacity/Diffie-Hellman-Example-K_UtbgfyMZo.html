exchange algorithm using an example the
prime number Q is 353 and the Alpha
which is the primitive root of Q is 3
user a selects a random number which is
a secret to herself and this value is 97
so she compute y a which is 3 reached
the power of 97 mod 353 and the result
is 40 user B selects a random number
which we saw secret to himself and this
value is 233 and he compute Y B which is
3 raised to a power of 233 mod 353 and
the result is 248 and they exchange
these values that is user a sense 42 use
a B and use a B sense 248 to user a then
user a computer following Y a raise to a
power of X 8 mark Q in this case would
be 248 raised to power of 97 mod 353 and
the result is 160 likewise user be
confused why a raised to the power of X
P makyo
in this case it is 40 raised to the
power of 233 mod 353 and the result is
160 so as you can see by exchanging why
am I be both users a MP confused the
same secret value which is 160 and this
would become the shear secret key
between users a and B we assume that an
attacker will be able to obtain these
publicly exchange values which we call
them public keys and they also know the
properly known numbers Q and alpha in
this case because the integers involved
are very small it is feasible that the
attacker would be able to figure out the
sukkah value XA and xB which is 97 and
233 however if very large number is
involved such as when the prime number Q
is
least 300 bits long then the task of
finding XA desuka Vario from Y a the
public value is not feasible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
