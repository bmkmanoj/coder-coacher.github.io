to calculate and return values let's see
one more example where we can use return
values this time we'll be generating and
returning random numbers and random
values are really useful in simulating
any real-world behavior that involves
chance or random events like simulating
rolling dice which we'll get to when you
roll a 6-sided dice one roll will have a
value of either 1 2 3 4 5 or 6
but you aren't sure which value it will
take for each roll there's an element of
chance so we can use random numbers to
generate a random roll value within this
range but before we get to that let's
learn a little bit more about random
values in Java to generate random values
in Java we'll be using a built-in math
function called random this function
doesn't take in any parameters but it
returns a random value that we can then
use in our programs and like how our
print 1 function was always attached to
system dot out this math function random
is attached to this word math which
we'll learn more about later in this
line of code which is a call to random
outputs a random decimal number between
0 and 1 the range of numbers it can
output include 0 but doesn't quite go
all the way up to include 1 and each
time we call random by saying math dot
random this will return a random number
like 1 call might return 0 another 0.591
7 another a 0.23 8 2 in any small
decimal up to almost 1 it's a maximum
return value is still going to be a
decimal point just really close to 1
something like 0.9999 and since math dot
random returns a random value as output
we can assign the value of this function
call to a variable this will be a double
because it's a number that involves
decimal points and let's call this value
random number and now we can work with
this returned value to get a more
specific range of random values for
example we can take the value of our
random number and multiply it by 10 to
get a larger random range we know that
our random number will be in
zero to almost 1 so if math dot random
outputs its lowest possible value a zero
will have 0 times 10 which equals zero
for this line of code and that will be
the minimum value for this range and if
metha
random generates one of its highest
values which is around zero point nine
nine nine if we multiply this by ten
we'll get nine point nine nine and that
will be our new max so we've just
changed our range from zero to almost 1
to 0 to almost ten just by multiplying
next if we want to change this range so
that we're generating random integers
instead of random doubles which are
numbers with decimals we can cast this
value to an int and restoring that value
in a variable called random int casting
means that you're turning one variable
type into another so when we cast a
decimal number which for random number
is a type of double to an int this cast
will drop whatever decimal value the
original number has and turn that double
into an end so say a random number has a
value of nine point nine eight five even
though this value is close to 10 when we
cast this value to an int it will just
turn into nine and the decimal part
0.985 will be ignored it's the same for
other cases if a random number is
something like 1.25 - this decimal
portion 0.25 - will be ignored and a
cast will turn it into just one a value
of zero point five seven - eight will
have this whole decimal portion ignored
and will turn into the integer zero and
to do this casting we just write our
casting type in this case int which we
want our number to become in parentheses
right before the value we want to change
in this case right before the value of
random number which starts out as a
double now this random int that holds
the value of our cast random number will
always be a value in the integer range
from zero to nine including nine great
now let's use this knowledge about
casting and changing range of random
numbers to help us write a program that
simulates and returns the
recked integer values for randomly
rolled dice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
