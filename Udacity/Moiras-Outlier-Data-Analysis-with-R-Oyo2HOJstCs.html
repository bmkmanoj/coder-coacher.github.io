really terrible plot with one big tall
bar and that's because most people
guessed a kind of small number but at
least one person guessed ten million
people saw my post which was not true
the first thing I needed to do was
adjust the axes so that I could actually
see the bulk of the data so I cut this
one outlier out and then I looked
basically at people who guessed a few
thousand or below then you got a
slightly better histogram by adjusting
the axes and you can still see that the
bulk of the data is in these smaller
ranges but it still was kind of hard to
see how large people thought their
audiences were more just explain how she
encountered an outlier in her data and I
want you to think about what type of
outlier do you think it was so try
answering this question do you think
Moore's outlier was an example of bad
data about an on extreme case bad data
about an extreme case or was it good
data about an extreme case choose the
best answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
