advocate on the firebase team welcome
Jenny hello so I've got this friend who
is developing an app and considering
firebase so i was wondering if i have a
little time to answer some questions of
course so i guess the most basic
question is do you have some examples of
firebase being used in the real world
yeah few examples come to mind of a
great use of the firebase one is
gotomeeting which uses firebase for
real-time signaling between clients so
you know when somebody's taken the mic
to speak another example is a twitch TV
which does video game streaming they use
it for signaling all their streams
coming online my favorite is probably
warby parkers location in New York a
more be Parker uses it to control the
pneumatic system that delivers your
glasses to you right while you're
waiting that's really cool so why do
these developers go with firebase what
was it unique what was unique about
firebase that made it the choice for
them so I think like the thing that
makes firebase unique because there's a
lot of options for building you know
backends for you is just how easy it is
to use firebase people usually get a
good pretty comfortable firebase it for
a few hours and have a production-ready
app within a couple days it's awesome so
in your opinion what is like the killer
app or the most differentiating piece of
firebase so I think the applications
that work best with with firebase are
ones that are going to be generating a
lot of a structured data from user
interactions like one of the classic
cases of this is chat which is one of
the deceptively hard things to build on
your own but um so things that you can
kind of model kind of think of as a chat
communication between multiple people
work really well on firebase so it's
expanding on that and your opinion what
are really the the classic use is what
are the best apps that are suited for
firebase the best apps that are suited
for firebase so any situation where you
have like low frequency information or
medium frequency information coming from
from mobile apps web applications that
need to be synchronized back and forth
between multiple platforms web and
mobile all those combinations or even
signaling like Internet of Things
systems and you don't want to kind of
build up independent infrastructure for
each one of those
alright well Jay thanks a lot for your
time today you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
