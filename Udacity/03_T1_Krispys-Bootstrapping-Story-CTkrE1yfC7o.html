in Canada in the Toronto area
specifically in the Milton area and you
know there really wasn't a lot of money
to be had when I was in high school you
know poor poor kids running around farm
country and I had a friend who had a
truck and one day he turned to me and
said hey you know you're smart why don't
you figure out a way that we could make
some money and I was just like okay so
as he would drive me to and from school
I kept looking out the window as you do
when you're driving and I would see farm
equipment everywhere old farm equipment
rotting in fields rusted you know
dilapidated etc one day we were in in
the town and we passed by building that
had a huge sign over it that said we buy
your scrap metal research revealed that
this was a recycling plant and then it
struck me hey my friends got a truck
there's all this old farm equipment
rotting in fields it's obviously not
wanted and here's a place that's willing
to buy metal so i turned my friend and i
said hey how would you feel about
calling these people up we're just
visiting them out of the blue and saying
why don't you pay us to remove your old
equipment that's just dying in your yard
we'll take it away and then we would
take that equipment to the recycle plant
he thought this was a brilliant idea he
was willing to contribute his truck and
both of us would use our physical
prowess to move this heavy equipment and
shortly after doing that we had quickly
cleared out the territory that we were
in farm equipment and had quite a bit of
money in our bank accounts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
