three hours great thinking if you found
these numbers we want to keep in mind
that T represents the number of hours it
takes for Lucy to mow the yard alone so
when we saw 40 in this equation will
find Lucy's time to be in solving this
equation we want to multiply through by
the LCD which is one and two tenths
times T times T plus one it's the
product of these three denominators
since they're all different and the
greatest common factor is one when we
multiply through by the LCD will see
that the factors cancel the t's will
cancel the quantity T plus 1 will reduce
to 1 and the number one point two are
one and two tenths reduces to 1 as well
this leaves us with one and two tenths
times T plus 1 here 1 and 2 10 ste here
and the quantity T plus 1 times T here
well distribute the one and two tenths
and the T to the terms to get this
equation then we'll combine the like
terms on the left-hand side to get two
and four tens times T plus 1 and 2 x
equals T squared plus T to get rid of
these decimals will multiply through by
10 so we'll have 20 40 plus 12 equals 10
t squared plus 10t now we have a
quadratic equation that we can try and
factor we want to move all of these
terms to the right hand side and then
see if we can factor so subtracting 20
40 and 12 will get 10 T squared minus 14
t minus 12 on the right hand side of our
equation and we'll get 0 on the left I
notice that all of these terms are even
so i can divide my entire equation by 20
divided by two is zero i'm going to
divide each of these terms by two from
this quadratic equation we use factoring
by grouping to get the factors of 5t
plus 3 and t minus two we set each of
these factors equal to zero and then we
solve for the values of T we find that T
can equal positive 2 or T can equal
negative three-fifths we know that T
represents the time for Lucy to mow the
yard so we don't want to use this
negative value it wouldn't make sense
here instead it will use T equals 2 so
she takes two hours to mow the yard
if we remember Javier's time was t plus
1 he took an hour longer than Lucy so
this means he would mow the yard in
three hours we just needed to add one on
to Lucy's time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
