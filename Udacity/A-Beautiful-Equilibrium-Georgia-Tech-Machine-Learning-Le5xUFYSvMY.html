concept for you it is called the Nash
equilibrium
nice ok here's the setup you have n
players so we move beyond simply two
players we have n players and each
player has strategies you can choose
from so here I'm referring to them as s1
these are all the strategies for player
one as two or all the strategies for
player two up to SN all the players for
strategy in got it yep okay so each of
these are set so I'm gonna say that the
particular strategies s1 star as two
star as three stars so on and so forth
as in star that is a strategy that each
of the end players is chosen is in a
Nash equilibrium if and only if for each
one of those strategies chosen by the
end players it is the strategy that
maximizes the utility for that
particular player it is the strategy
that maximizes the utility for that
particular player given all the other
strategies that were chosen
now I actually find that very difficult
to kind of work through so let me try to
say it a different way given that you
have a set of strategies s 1 star as 2
star as 3 star as n star we know that
they are in Nash equilibrium if and only
if if you randomly chose one of the
players and gave them the chance to
switch their strategy they would have no
reason to do it interesting ok so does
that make sense yeah right so an
equilibrium right just in general the
word sort of makes sense where the
equilibrium is at a place where
everything is balanced and in some sense
there's no reason for anything to move
because they're in balance so we say
that a set of strategies are a Nash
equilibrium if no one person has any
reason to change their strategy in a
world where everyone else the strategy
remains the same then you're then you're
in equilibrium and a particular you're
in a Nash equilibrium
Nash you Guilherme ok good do you know
Nash's Ogden Nash was a poet not that
Nash I think there was a TV series with
the National
yes there was but you're thinking of
John Nash that's right the Nobel Prize
winning person who was the who's
featured in the movie A Beautiful Mind
yep
that's exactly right and it was in fact
a beautiful equilibrium okay so there's
the notion of Nash equilibrium it was
minted by John Nash if you believe the
movie in order to pick up women which I
you know you know I never never seen
this movie oh really oh I watched it and
it was it was surprising how unhelpful
it was in explaining what a Nash
equilibrium was I'm not surprised I hope
this is helpful though so it really is a
kind of difficult concept to completely
wrap your mind around but what it really
boils down to is listen if we all picked
a bunch of strategies and we knew that
one other person one of us we don't know
who beforehand but we know that one of
us would have the opportunity to change
their strategy after they see what
everyone else's strategy is we'd be in a
Nash equilibrium only if that person
whoever that person is has no reason to
change their strategy gotcha so
specifically you made a distinction
between strategies that were pure and
strategies that were mixed right and I
guess I don't see in this case which
kind we're talking about right so in
this particular case we're talking about
pure strategies however exactly this
wording works with mixed strategies oh I
see so you can have a pure Nash
equilibrium or a mixed Nash equilibrium
right
and so you could each one of these
instead of choosing a particular
strategy and saying they're Nash
equilibrium you could talk about a
probability distribution over each of
these sets of strategies and say those
are in Nash equilibrium if no one would
want to change their probability
distribution got it so this works for
both pure and mixed alright so you think
you understand this sure good we will
test that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
