message that you convey into your
professional network but what about
actually building a linkedin network
this is where all of your hard work
comes into fruition it's time to get
connected with others why connect
networking is important having a
connection can actually be even more
powerful than your skills or expertise
once you have a network you might be
able to find a connection at a company
you want to work for and more people
will be aware of your job hunt who
should you connect with connect with
people who like you and who know how you
work don't connect with someone you've
never met and found via search on
linkedin and don't be spammy the
connections section can also be a great
place for recommendations but be
selective on who you ask to recommend
you reach out to people who are
intimately aware of the work you've done
and who can speak specifically about how
you contributed but don't go for too
many one recommendation / major work
experience is fine if you have five
recommendations for one job it can look
like you were twisting their arms to
write them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
