myself a Bay Area native I grew up in
Fremont and I'm a genetic counselor and
technically I guess my title is
perinatal genetic counselors so I focus
on patients who are pregnant or thinking
about pregnancy and as a genetic
counselor are there sub disciplines like
are I mean are there genetic counselors
who focus on sort of the non perinatal
aspect certainly so this profession is
still pretty new I think in the
beginning there weren't that many
specialties it was either pediatrics
children and and prenatal was a second I
think as soon as pregnancy test started
and since then there are several
different specialties the big ones are
Pediatrics prenatal cancer has become
the hot new thing counselors who work in
the laboratory and then specialty
counselors who work in certain
disciplines like cardiology or neurology
or what are the what are the various
backgrounds do all genetic counselors
have the same academic training or do
they have diverse academic training so
yeah and so counselors come from a wide
variety of backgrounds they do have in
common that they have to have a master's
degree and the master's degree programs
require an undergraduate usually
four-year college but and some
prerequisite science courses biology
chemistry but other than that you can be
any major so my classmate was a
psychology major I was a genetics major
some people were completely not really
as to either specialty as long as they
finished their courses did you always
know you wanted to be a genetic
counselor or was this a later decision
so it's very interesting I'll tell you
this story and I like to share it when I
give talks that I didn't find out about
genetic counseling until about a year
after I graduated from undergrad I went
to UC Berkeley and I knew I liked
science and I really liked genetics so I
was a genetics major and at that time
when I was going to school the main
option was to be a good physician and
there wasn't that many other allied
health care physicians and so when I
found out that that wasn't really what
was my career path I decided to go into
something totally different for a couple
years it was only after I was really
after I graduated
pack my boxes from college that I picked
up a brochure about genetic counseling
and that's how I found out about the
profession
I just find it ironic just because UC
Berkeley had one of the oldest genetic
counseling trading programs at that
point they were probably like in the
first four so it had been going on for
twenty thirty years and when I was an
undergrad I had no exposure or knowledge
about the program and so now I feel like
every time I get a chance to get back I
like to promote the profession nice what
kind of training was involved so once
you've figured out that's something you
wanted what do you do to become a
genetic counselor officially so it's
very specific so it's usually a two or
three year master's program specifically
in genetic counseling so all the courses
are geared towards the science of
genetics and counseling theory and so
right now I just did the steps I think
they're about 30 programs nationwide so
there are three in California and then
in other states and so you still have to
apply take standard testing like GREs is
still around and do some training like
volunteering in health care settings so
I volunteered at Planned Parenthood for
a year I see doing the pregnancy test
school and then applied are there
different certifications for different
states like if you get trained in one
state if you're in the United States we
do have an international audience but if
you're knighted States if you had get
certified or get your degree or you're
able to move and and be a genetic
counselor in any state that's a really
good question so the certification in
the the credit in process for genic
counselors has changed it used to be a
certificate issued by a national
organization through our national
organization called National Society of
genetic counseling and then just
probably in the past five six years many
of the states pushed for licensure so
that we'd have a license just like any
other healthcare professional dog
groomer hairdresser which would open up
opportunities for billing and for status
and things so this state just started to
stream licenses four years ago see what
do you think about the profession itself
overall is it says is it a profession
that's growing a number and and how is
it growing if it is so yeah the the
profession itself definitely is growing
in number I don't have you
by year but I think in the very
beginning I think the first national
society started in the late 70s and then
there are probably 10 to 30 members
maybe and now I think we're up to past
2000 nation wise in the state I'm
organizing this conference coming up so
I just did some stats in this state
there's probably about 400 licensed
genetic counselors so just to give a
perspective of we're still a small
specialty but definitely growing is I
guess this is sort of more of the
personal side but I mean is do you like
being a genetic counselor do you feel
like you're helping people what what
aspect of doing this job is probably the
the best and most fulfilling for you I
think it's a combination of things like
this job definitely I I really enjoy
being a genic counselor it really fits
my niche that it combines my interest in
my love of science and specifically
genetics and genetic conditions with
seeing patients helping people in a
healthcare setting so I've been thinking
about some of these answers that you
know the traditional role for a
healthcare professional is a doctor but
doctors have a lot of stress a lot of
schooling doing treatments and
procedures and I wasn't necessarily
interested in that part I was really
more interested in communicating to
patients and feeling like I could help
them just using my words or just being
there for them and listening to them so
I really feel that this profession has
been a really good fit for for me and my
personality yeah now you said you're a
perinatal genetic counselor so walk us
through what is it like I mean who what
kind of patient comes to you and how
does the workflow process work when they
seek out a genetic counselor okay
so the workflow for a perinatal genetic
counselor and perinatal is actually kind
of a new phrase we created at where I
work traditionally the word has been
prenatal so before birth and then
there's postnatal and now that we're
doing so much intervention before birth
that affects after birth we use the
combination of perinatal so most of the
patients that I see are pregnant
actively pregnant and thinking about
doing some testing to check for either
genetic conditions or birth defects
sometimes we see patients before they
get pregnant
they know they want to have children and
know that there might be at risk for a
certain condition so our appointments
are fairly they're like office
consultations we do a little prep work
we might contact them on the phone and
get a little family history or medical
history and then our meeting with them
is probably about 40 minutes 40 to 60
minutes long and then afterwards if
we've ordered testing or there's other
appointments to make we'll follow up and
help patients with that now I'm really
curious about the the testing so do
patients come to you and say I want to
know what's in my genes and what I pass
on and you guys do a test for them yeah
so I think our patients are a little
biased I mean I'm sure they're it seems
like they're they're certainly patients
out there who would say or people out
there who would say they don't want to
there and know their genetic status and
those patients we never end up seeing
because they would just decline an
appointment with us so those that we do
see definitely are interested in some
kind of genetic information whether it's
for themselves or primarily for their
pregnancy or for their future child so
yeah so sometimes there's something
specific in the family that we're
looking for we've had some patients just
say test me for everything I'm going to
know everything and we have to explain
the science and technology's not quite
there yet and so we're trying to
pinpoint what can we offer you accurate
testing specific testing something that
would be helpful to so young and what
kind of what do you think about the sort
of new wave of personal genetics and
companies that are able to get samples
from individuals and look at genes for
them how does how does that fit in with
this whole process of patients coming to
you right so this whole wave of personal
genomics they've called it it's a it's a
separate court category by itself and
hasn't quite cross in the Penal realm
yet but I mean we certainly hear about
it indirectly from our colleagues I
think just with our experience with a
genetic testing a lot of genetic testing
is not straightforward sometimes we find
things and we don't know how to
interpret and so the personal genomics I
think is a exciting new field but also
as with any new test comes with
limitations
and you know those of us in the
community of genetic counselors some
were very supportive of that technology
some of us are still a little hesitant
and cautious about is it more harmful
than helpful to start looking for things
that may not have a complete answer to
like opening up Pandora's Box kind of
thing can you give me any examples any
specific examples of traits like that
that you think are you know make it more
difficult to really understand like is
there a particular kind of dilemma or is
the patient ever come to you or you
thought you're in a situation where you
were giving them information that maybe
they couldn't do anything with yeah so
there's there's actually so I have a few
examples so one one example of a test
that's not straightforward that kind of
gives us a little difficulty in
counseling is maybe for a condition like
hemochromatosis so that's an adult type
onset condition where you don't have
symptoms until you reach adulthood and
it causes iron storage or overload it
can be treated fairly easily but it does
need treatment the issue with the
genetics of it is that there is a gene
or two genes associated with the
condition but the gene is not the full
picture so people who have changes in
the gene don't always have the condition
and so I think there's a lot of
conditions like that Alzheimer's high
cholesterol levels where you identify a
gene but it's not a hundred percent
correlation that that gene changed
always causes symptoms and then you're
left with not the not the whole picture
and you're giving probabilities and so
then the issue becomes is that helpful
to know of about know about a
possibility that you may or may not be
able to change or treat so that's been I
think the big dilemma the ethical
dilemma is some people would say I'd
still want to know because I want to
prepare myself and try to do as much
prevention as possible other people
would say well if it's not for sure I'm
going to be left worrying and and I'd
rather just take it as it comes so I
think that's the big issue with the new
genetic technologies in general whether
it's looking for a trade or specific
condition that most of the testing right
now is not 100 100 percent accurate or
specific sounds like a lot of what you
end up doing
as well as sort of education patient
education of traits and testing and how
to interpret various results definitely
so a lot of what I do is I think of it
as a consultation but also just
providing information I see us as a link
between physicians and patients that
traditionally doctors order tests that
are fairly straightforward like a blood
count or a blood type or something like
that and they can easily tell a patient
what that means in a sentence with this
genetic testing it's much more
complicated than that it's not always a
straightforward yes or no and doctors
don't have time to spend with patients
explaining that and so I see us as a
bridge between that being able to help
patients decipher and interpret this
information and then also helping them
make decisions based on those results
because a lot of decisions to be made
especially in pregnancy are not always
medical decisions they're personal
decisions about what patients want to do
about information about their future
offspring so so prenatal specifically is
an interesting ethical realm because
we're also dealing with pregnancy and
and termination what's the most
difficult aspect of that if I can ask is
it is it patients actually you know
deciding about you know continuing the
pregnancy versus not are there
significant traits that they have to do
with they're just looking for some kind
of idea when it when it does get grey as
far as like the difficult part of the
job yeah so ya know you bring up a good
point I actually hadn't thought about
that before one of the difficulties in
the job in what I do with pregnancy is
we're not always we're certainly talking
about genetic testing sometimes we were
dealing with other kinds of tests and
pregnancy like ultrasounds so video
picture of the baby where you see a
physical problem that might be something
that suggested genetic condition like
Down syndrome or something else and
seeing the physical problem doesn't
guarantee what the outcome is going to
be and so that is one difficulty in
prenatal that you don't have a live
person in front of you to say oh this
person is actually fine maybe they have
an extra finger or toe but they're
otherwise healthy in a pregnancy you
don't you don't have that baby in front
of you and you can't check if there's
other things going on so I think that
definitely is one difficult aspect of
what I do specifically and I would just
say in general just dealing with
pregnant patients is tough pregnancy is
a time-limited event so I feel like of
all the subspecialties in genetic
counseling prenatal is usually the one
the the most time-sensitive were under
deadlines for scheduling appointments
seeing patients test results and just
the anxiety of the patients themselves
they also have hormone issues to deal
with it's a very emotional time so it
can be quite challenging but it also can
be quite satisfying
actually there is an interesting with
that and thought of either I mean I
guess in its portrayed maybe in the
media at least maybe in TV and movies to
a certain extent that I'm you know these
kinds of this kind of information or
even services for reproductive services
the best way to say that um for couples
is generally considered more of a middle
to upper-class sort of information thing
is this what does that like in the
genetic counseling what I mean do is
this something that only certain couples
end up doing because you know they're
you know don't know the best way to
phrase this question but you know is is
access to this sort of across the board
for all types what's the general
demographic of people who are sort of
taking part trying to find this
information
yeah so at least here in California were
in this Bay Area I think we're in a
unique bubble in terms of who comes to
see us and access you know the state
government has ensured that all pregnant
women have some kind of medical coverage
during the pregnancy so we're fortunate
that we can see patients on the state
insurance called medi-cal and as well as
private pay patients I think the issue I
think many patients who come see us are
very appreciative of what we can provide
but different patients need different
things so patients who are lower to
middle class or of lower education
status may not need all the explanation
of the genetic testing may be less
likely to take the genetic testing but
it could still benefit from meeting with
us to explain all the options so we see
a huge spectrum of patients but you've
been in my employers group we have
different offices so in different cities
so the area that I'm in is
is an affluent area private insurance
patients are the ones I generally see
who are educated and know the lingo of
chromosomes and genes versus we have an
office in the southern portion of the
Bay Area where there are more
non-english speaking patients patients
on the state medical insurance who who
don't know what a chromosome is may not
be interested in further genetic testing
so so that you know yeah that would be a
challenge for dealing with different
patients at the same time - yeah if it
were in the same you know practice or
office yeah you know usually we we find
it helpful like our groups specifically
will call patients at least try to
contact some patients ahead of time to
see what their concerns are so we call
that a phone intake and we find it
really helpful especially for the higher
end more educated patients who have a
specific agenda or specific questions
they want answered to do that do it that
way so I'm also curious what is is there
a common trait or condition that you
count so for the most like what is what
are the things that you either end up
counseling for or do people come to you
and ask them us what are they most
interested in so for my specific
specialty in pre nail by far I think
nationwide the most common condition
that we're talking about is Down
syndrome but I was thinking about how I
explained why I think it's a combination
of things because the condition is
genetic but it's not inherited so it
would randomly appear and there we no
other way to tell about it
other than to check for it in that
pregnancy and is there's a known
association with the age of the mom as
women get older there's a higher chance
of Down syndrome the insurance is
actually will cover testing for Down
syndrome so that's kind of a supportive
step that that aids us in seeing
patients it's common a common condition
I think about one in eight hundred a
thousand births for Down syndrome occur
and it can be a long-term disability
children with Down syndrome grew up into
adults they have intellectual disability
they can have health issues and so it
seems like there's enough interest in
that that we have this
testing so for my specialty it's fairly
easy we talk primarily about that and
some related conditions whereas in other
specialties like Pediatrics where I used
to work it could be a range of things a
variety of things depending on what a
child comes in to for us to see whether
it's a learning problem would think
about would make us think about certain
conditions versus if it was a physical
birth defect like a heart defect or a
cleft lip that would shift our gear to
something else if you do testing for
something like Down syndrome does that
mean you're taking a genetic sample from
the developing embryo so that is still
the gold standard yes to test for Down
syndrome accurately is still an invasive
test where you're taking tissue
indirectly from the baby so either now
no synthesis or chorionic villus
sampling which have been I think
available for a generation now so those
are still kind of the gold standard way
to test for Down syndrome and other
chromosome problems because we have
tissue from that baby but more and more
over the years we have a lot more
alternate tests that don't require
invasiveness into the pregnancy
primarily blood tests and ultrasounds
that can check markers for Down syndrome
versus the amnion the CVS are looking at
the chromosomes and looking at the cause
of Down syndrome so so now we have a
combination of both and I think
especially now patients are faced with
so many choices it really can help them
to meet with us to sort out all the
different options the benefits the risk
numbers detection rates things like that
what's the most difficult trait you've
had to counsel is it down syndrome or is
there another more difficult situation
or say that you've had to let's say
counseled the family on or a couple so
Down syndrome is always it's it's always
a difficult tray like I was think about
this because I have experience both in
prenatal and in Pediatrics I mean one of
my most memorable patient cases had to
not to do with a prenatal case but a
pediatric case where we were seeing a
child and part of the list of conditions
we were thinking about was taste acts
disease so that one is a also a known
single gene recessive
that is common in people of Jewish
background so when we were thinking
about that disease that usually means
that the child is coming in with delays
and maybe normal development and loss of
delays so it's not like it was it's a
surprise to the family we we would talk
to them about this is a possibility
we're going to be ordering tests for
this condition but it's always hard to
have to call or contact a family and
tell them this is this this is a
condition so I think any kind of test
result that confirms a condition that it
has high risk for complications or early
death that's never easy to convey you do
yes we do we always do pedigrees it's
kind of our shorthand for gathering
medical tests are you good how fast can
you like draw petting okay I'm pretty
people my colleagues would say I'm too
fast at a lot of things so I'm pretty
fast at drawing a pedigree we have
colleagues I don't have the template
that hat they used to have a template
that you could trace a pedigree and so I
had colleagues who could whip out that
template and do the the rotation and
things but most of us can draw freehand
pretty well but now there are programs
that also draw pedigrees because mine
are fairly basic I could take maybe
three generations of pedigrees so
patients their children and their
parents some pedigrees like for cancer
where you're really trying to pinpoint
all the individuals with cancer those
pedigrees could get huge and then I
think the counselors definitely need
help with a program that can kind of
line things up and sort things out so
the families really have all this
information like are you able to build
like these massive categories are you
end up building these sort of more like
just maybe two or three generations so
family it's very in how much information
they can give us for pedigrees I see a
lot of patients also I should mention
that come from other countries
especially specifically Asia we're not
as not much is known about family
members people don't talk about
conditions in the family so the pet and
and people don't have that many children
so the pedigrees can be very sparse so
just like a circle and a square and
Circle Square and that's it and then all
the way to families who have their whole
genealogy trees mapped out with the aid
of all these online tools so they come
in with their pedigrees already drawn so
it's really a fun part of our job job
but it's also efficient to draw this out
instead of trying to describe all these
people I have a really interesting
question to ask for all of our students
who might be struggling with pedigrees
out there how do you as an actual
genetic counselor let's say you're
studying a trait how do you distinguish
when you're looking at traits at a
recessive or dominant trait and put it
in context of what you think is going on
so that so trying to figure out a trait
whether it's dominant recessive review
an x-linked those are the top three
modes of inheritance that we're looking
at we actually have a term called
pedigree analysis and you know it's it's
a subjective thing but it really is
looking at the pedigree and going
through kind of all the rules of what
dominant inheritance looks like what
recessive inheritance looks like so if
you see a trait that happens in a
grandparent a parent and a child then
that's much more likely to be a dominant
trait if you see a condition where
multiple brothers and sisters are and by
chance maybe their parents are related
to each other and no one else in the
family has a trait then that's more
likely or suggestive of something
recessive and then if you see only boys
affected through moms that could be more
x-linked so the pedigree really does
help us try to figure out modes of
inheritance that's really cool um what
about I'm super curious because in our
class we we actually learn about sort of
the possibility of recessive and
dominant in an autosomal context and in
excellent context and we also briefly go
over a maternal inheritance which would
be any conditions that affect
mitochondria there are any conditions or
traits that you ever have to deal with
it if that model so I'm very fortunate
that I don't interact or I don't have to
do so much with maternal inheritance
like mitochondrial inheritance because
it can be that's that's still a very
tricky type of inheritance up along with
imprinting effects so there are some
complicated
modes of inheritance that I mean you
could see in a prenatal pedigree but it
would be hard to be born out unless
someone had a name of a known
mitochondrial condition but my
colleagues and Pediatrics certainly are
looking at children where there might be
something mitochondrial going on it
gives a specific phenotype or picture
where children have certain metabolic
lab results they have learning delays or
physical problems so oftentimes they are
telling families there is a diagnosis of
something mitochondrial and trying to
explain inheritance patterns which that
is that is really tough because there's
a much higher recurrence risk in that
than the traditional modes of
inheritance have you ever had to look at
a trait or I don't know I'm just curious
have you ever looked at a trait went
there what no one knows what the
inheritance pattern is yet like if you
ever discovered a new one here that's
not what does that happen as a genetic
counselor are you ever looking at traits
that no one's ever described before so
that's kind of two separate questions so
that looking at a pedigree sometimes we
don't know the inheritance like it
doesn't fit a traditional dominant or
doesn't fit a traditional recessive so
that's kind of the fun part of our job
where it's a rare occurrence of
something happening so it's not I don't
think we've discovered a new inheritance
but we've discovered new instances of a
rare rare instances of things that can
happen with traditional inheritance
patterns so that's that's one way like
something happens on top of something
else and that's what gives that pattern
and then we can also be fooled when
people are related to each other
because then that throws things because
it could be a dominant trait but if
there's relatives that are related to
each other
it could be recessive as well and then
your other question just about I mean we
certainly have conditions that nobody's
described before and we see it in
prenatal but we've seen in more in
Pediatrics where a child comes to us
with a unique set of symptoms and that's
not been described and so that that's a
cool part of a pediatric genetics
counselor or doctors job is they might
actually identify a new syndrome so I
haven't personally been part of that but
my colleagues actually have and we know
physicians who have discovered new
conditions and how
had them named after them yeah that's
crazy that's pretty cool I also wanted
to know you know when I learned genetics
the first time and you just said a
second ago it happens you have to look
for it when you're looking for maybe
recessive traits and you see if
unaffected parents and affected children
and you're looking for maybe close
relation yeah you know for new
beginnings new students to a class of
genetics are like does that really
happen do people find out that they
actually had children can you speak to
that oh how often do people find out
either whether they knew or didn't know
they didn't have children with somebody
of a close relation what's that like so
I would say that what we call
consanguinity when people are related to
each other often in my experience is not
an unknown thing I mean there are
certain cultures in other countries
where it's actually preferred that
people marry within the family and so
it's actually a known thing upfront that
they have to marry within their family
to keep funding or money or status in
the family I have had one instance when
I was talking to a patient on the phone
and drawing her pedigree that she did
not know she had married either a first
or her husband was her first or second
cousin and that she found out when they
were invited to the same family wedding
so I mean so I think it doesn't happen
for at least for me it hasn't happened
that often where people don't know
they're related to each other oftentimes
they're coming to us because they
already know that somehow and they're
worried about the risks from that
because you hear we learn about it in
textbooks but I'm like what or I guess
not even relatedness but coming from the
same community so for example just
people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and I
would say hopefully it's not
disrespecting anyone from the community
but I think there are a lot of
communities whether they're religious or
cultural that tend to marry from that
community and it's just I think they
call it a founder effect so many an
ancestor in that from that general
culture happened to carry a bad
recessive or serious recessive gene like
tay-sachs disease and he happened to
have a lot of children and those
children happy
to marry each other and then that
condition really increased in incidence
and so that's happened that's been known
to happen in certain pockets of
populations even if they're not related
to each other if they're a closed
community so so it's fortunate or
unfortunate I and the Jewish population
in general I feel like they they are
aware of those increased risk so many
people are screened to see if they carry
some of these genes even before they get
married that's it well let's let's close
out here I'm curious let's maybe think
brought spective again and a broad
perspective what um what do you think
other people think about genetics and
genetic counseling what do you what do
you think the general viewpoint is and
do you think that's good or bad and
should we try to change that or
influence it in a certain way or is it
fine on its own so I I'm I'm very
interested in what what the public
opinion is of genetic counseling and I
feel like we here in the Bay Area are in
a very specific bubble where we're very
fortunate we're in a very liberal area
where genetic testing is available
pregnancy termination is available and
so I feel like that the opinion of
genetic counselors here in this area is
fairly favorable that people definitely
if they have met with a genetic
counselor have definitely found it
helpful and useful I actually don't
think in general nationwide I still
think it's a fairly small profession and
my sense is that I mean we're doing more
to promote the profession but I think
there's still a lot of people who don't
know what genetic counselors do and
where they fit into things a lot of
patients even here especially if they
come from other countries will hear the
counseling part of genetic and think
it's a therapy session so there's still
a lot of misconceptions about what the
term means I don't think it's viewed
negatively I think it's just it's still
not very well known like other allied
health professionals professions like
nurses or social workers or dentists so
there's it's encouraging that there are
more and more of us and with the media
being more available on internet
hopefully we'll be promoting our
profession better and just spreading the
word
the benefits of genetic counseling great
if there's somebody watching right now
who's really interested and wants to
learn more about being a genetic
counselor what would you do you have any
particular good resource you tell them
to give a visit or do you have any
special message you would tell them
about genetic counseling so yeah I would
I would highly recommend the profession
if anyone's thinking about genetic
counseling it's a very good combination
of medicine and healthcare and
interacting with patients so we call
that a clinical kind of job if you like
patients and if you like the specific
field of genetics because that's pretty
much what we're talking about so if you
don't like genetics I wouldn't recommend
this profession but if you want to work
with people but still be in tune with
the science it's a really good
profession and we do have a National
Society so there's a website NSG see org
that has all the information about the
training programs the background
requirements we've done provisional
status surveys to talk about salary job
satisfaction genetic counselors tend to
be more on the side of female I think
it's actually up to 95 percent our
female so the male genetic counselors
are very well known in the field because
there aren't that many of them social
year in California
so because of that there's good and bad
for that there are a lot of counselors
who work part-time and we don't take
call like physicians or nurses and so
for those again who want to go into
medicine but don't want the extra stress
of those kinds of things it's a really
nice profession a lot of lots of
counselors work part-time again because
we're seeing patients and they can be
scheduled appointments the salaries I
think especially with our certification
and licensure hopefully are starting to
increase and there's certainly a lot of
job opportunity so I would highly
recommend checking out the website in
talking to a genetic counselor if you
can even shadowing a counselor and doing
some volunteer work in healthcare just
to make sure that's the area that they
like to be in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
