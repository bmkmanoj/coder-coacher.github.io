one of the things we use based on a lot
for is learning from documents or text
learning and the methods that I'll tell
you about is often called naive Bayes
it's actually misnomers cannot be naive
not as a naive Bayes rule itself but
that's the name okay so you're going to
exercise this later in our practice
exams using Enron email data sets but I
give you the gist of it support we have
two people what is called Chris and one
is called Sarah and both people write a
lot of email and for simplicity I'll
assume that these emails only contain
three words okay they contain the word
love the word deal and the word life
same is true about Sarah obviously
people use more than three words but
this area here is a little bit small for
30,000 words the difference of these two
people Chris and Sarah is in the
frequency at which she use those words
and just for simplicity let's say Chris
loves talking about deals so 80% of his
words or 0.8 our deal and he talks about
life and love quite a bit with 0.1
probability so if Chris utters a word an
email he's going to 80% of a time use
the word deal and 10% the time love or
life the Sarah talks more about love a
little bit of our deal 0.2 and about
life 0.3 and again that's a simplified
example but naive Bayes allows you to do
is to determine based on a random email
who is the likely person who sent this
email suppose says an email that goes as
follows love life and you don't know who
send it but you'd like to figure that
out then you can do this based on
baseball and suppose you believe a
priori that it's a 50% probability by
Chris / Sarah so let's say P of Chris
equals 0.5 that means the prior
probability for it being Chris's 50% and
that immediately means because it's from
one of the two that probability of Sarah
is also 0.5 so if you look at this
intuitively who is more likely to have
written this email Chris or Sarah just
check one box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
