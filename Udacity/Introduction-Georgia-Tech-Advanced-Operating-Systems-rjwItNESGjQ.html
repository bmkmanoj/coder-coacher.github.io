previously an operating system has to
protect the integrity of the hardware
resources and managers while providing
the services to the applications there
it has many responsibilities and a
variety of functional components that
provide these services but how should
all these pieces fit together at least
some of the components of the operating
system will have to run in a privileged
mode of the processor architecture that
allows them access to hardware but must
the whole operating system have this
privilege also if an application would
benefit from having certain services for
example memory management handled in a
particular way can we personalize the
services to suit the needs of the
application in other words can we make
the operating system flexible in terms
of the policies and implements for the
services offered by it does this
flexibility have to come at the price of
performance and/or safety of the
operating system these are some of the
questions we will try to answer in this
course module in this course module we
will learn the basics of operating
system structuring issues we will use
spin and exokernel as case studies of
two closely related approaches to
providing extensibility of operating
system services we will then study a
microkernel based approach as well using
l3 microkernel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
