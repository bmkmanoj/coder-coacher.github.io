puzzle to convert our dimple j/s plot to
pure d3 is to actually draw circles on
the page I put a debugger right after
all the code we've written so far and
let's check in and see what our page
actually looks like going back to the
browser we can see the debuggers paused
here and we can see that we have a Y and
an x-axis though they still look pretty
crude they are in the right relative
range going from zero to probably looks
like a hundred a thousand for attendance
and the years even though they're very
squashed and scrunched together if we
actually read them go from 1932 to 1934
to 1936 and so forth all the way to 2014
if we look to the far extent of this
axis and now we're so close to having
our chart done and I've happened to save
the best for last the actual circles we
want to draw with the sake of simplicity
I'm only going to recreate the
scatterplot now the way of a sense of
where we are in terms of the axes let's
jump back to sublime text and actually
create some circles for our data in
dimple we simply need to specify that we
want to draw some series corresponding
to some shapes in this case scatter or
line removing these two lines and also
since we don't have any dimple code left
we can simply remove the draw in d3
there's not an explicit draw function
but rather every SVG gets appended to
the page whenever we create it remember
in dimple since it's much higher level
than d3 we simply have to specify what
axis this series corresponds to and it
automatically knows we extend the scale
the axis of that now here's another
quirk of t3 if you remember from above
when we bound data we actually appended
circles to the page and now we're
selecting the circles already on the
page to add an exposition a y position a
radius and the fill going back to the
browser
you'll notice here that there aren't any
circles actually drawn but if we look
back at the code from where we started
when we bound your data we actually
appended circles so what gives where are
the SVG circles which are bound to data
which should be on the screen answer in
the box below where you think the
circles are on the screen or why they're
not showing up visually in our chart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
