of debugging or that's fairly
straightforward when we see a failure we
see which part of the state is erroneous
and then we track back the dependencies
to see which earlier states could
possibly have caused that infection and
we determine these possible states as
well as the locations in the program
whether it because through the
dependencies so if we see narrow down
here it could have come from here from
here or from here and one out of these
three or at least one of these one out
of these three should contain the
infection that we're looking for so we
use dependencies to find possible origin
for each infection in the second step we
use the scientific method to track down
infections we have the choice between
three possible origins here so we use
the scientific method to find out which
of these three parts of the state is at
fault we set up an experiment we make up
the appropriate observation and we
gradually refine or reject our
hypothesis until we have come up with
the diagnosis and figured out which part
of the state is wrong then we repeat the
whole thing back and back and back again
again choosing between multiple possible
origins following back the dependencies
and again using the scientific method to
track down which of these actually is at
fault set of the scientific method you
can also use deduction to rule out
specific possibilities for instance you
may be able to show that neither this
one now this one can possibly have
influenced the state under these
circumstances so the only one that
remains is the one up here you repeat
the process until you find a statement
who's in going state is all correct but
where the outgoing state is infected so
how do we call us
who's in going state is all correct but
its outgoing state is infected what is
this is this a cause a defect or an
infection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
