lights objects in a camera naturally the
next step is to render if you look
through an entire 3js program you've
seen this line telling the renderer
class to render the scene it's possible
to call the renderer once during
initialization and be done but usually
we want to have the scene be updated as
needed once the scene is set up calling
the animate function gets things rolling
the key bit of magic is the window
request animation frame call which in
turn uses the animate method itself this
method will start up a rendering
whenever it makes sense to do so the
other thing that requestanimationframe
does for you is help lower the
temperature of your computer no really
say you have a WebGL program running in
a browser window if you switch to
another tab the browser will know that
the program is no longer visible and it
will not keep it running the animate
method calls the render method to well
render the scene actually it can do much
more than that I like to separate out
the render method itself just to keep
track of what's doing what this method
is where you want to put code that
performs changes before rendering the
scene for example if the user modifies a
slider the sliders value is used here to
modify the scene we've seen that in
previous programs if you have a bouncing
ball animation you change the position
of the ball here this is where animation
gets going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
