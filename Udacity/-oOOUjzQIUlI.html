intersections we'll consider the most
basic situation two lines in two
dimensions while basic we will start to
see structures and procedures that will
remain present in more complex examples
a line in two dimensions can be defined
by two essential properties a point it
passes through which I'll call the base
point and a vector that gives the
direction of the line given the base
point X naught and the direction vector
V we can represent all points on a line
in the form X of T equals X naught plus
T times V notice that I'm abusing
notation by treating points as vectors
here this means given any number T we
can find a point on the line by plugging
in T to the expression X naught plus T
times V and computing it if we were to
theoretically plug in all possible
values of T and plot them we'd end up
with a plot of all the points on the
line this expression is called a
parameter ization of the line since we
are expressing the line via the
parameter T for example for the line X
of T equals the vector 1 negative 2 plus
T times the vector 3 1 taking T equal to
0 gives us the output 1 negative 2 which
is the base point for this
parameterization of the line if we take
T equals 1 then we get the output for
negative 1 another point on the line if
we take T equals negative 1/2 then we
get negative 1/2 negative 5 halves you
have another point on the line note that
a given line has infinitely many base
points since we can pick any point on
the line to be the base point and it has
infinitely many Direction vectors since
we can multiply any Direction vector by
a positive scalar and it will still
point in the same direction we could
also multiply the direction vector by a
negative number and the same set of
points will beam parameterised just
starting from the opposite direction
we can't multiply the direction vector
by 0 though or else we'll collapse the
line to a point you may have seen lines
written in the form y equals MX plus B
B&amp;amp;M our numbers this equation encodes
both a base point and a direction B is
the y-intercept the y coordinate of the
point at which the line intersects the y
axis
this gives the base point 0 comma B M is
the slope of the line which can be
translated into a direction vector of
the form 1 M for every unit of movement
in the X direction there are M units of
movement in the Y direction
this equation for representing a line
isn't perfect however since we do not
have the ability to define vertical
lines a more general form of equation
for representing a line is ax plus B y
equals K where a B and K are numbers and
at least one of a or B is nonzero to
reconstruct a base point from this
equation there are two cases
assuming B is not 0 you can set X to be
any number I'll take it to be 0 for this
example which becomes the x coordinate
of the base point then you can solve for
y to find the y coordinate of the base
point having taken x equals 0 this
becomes y equals K over B so a base
point for the line is 0 K over B on the
other hand if B does equal 0 then a will
not be 0 let y equal 0 in this case
solving for x gives us x equals K over a
so a base point will be K over a comma 0
so for this example here two possible
base points would be 0 comma 2 and 3
comma 0 now let's think about the
direction vector if we write down any
two points on the line then the vector
connecting the points will be a
direction vector for the line in this
example we've already written down two
points on the line but for a general
case how would we find the direction
vector let's start with a very
particular case when the constant term K
equals 0 here the equation reduces to
just ax plus B y equals 0 and notice
that this line passes through the origin
since the base point for this formula is
0 0
if we draw the vector from the origin to
another point X comma Y on the line then
the corresponding vector XY will be a
direction vector for the line now here's
a neat algebraic trick rewrite the
left-hand side of this equation as a dot
product of two vectors ax plus B Y
becomes the vector a B dotted with the
vector X Y now what does this equation
mean it means that the point X comma Y
is on this line if and only if the
vector X Y a direction vector for the
line is orthogonal to the vector a B
this means we can find a direction
vector for this line by picking some
vector orthogonal to a B one good way to
do that in two dimensions at least is to
just swap the coordinates in the vectors
and the gate one so picking B negative a
would give us a direction vector for
this line so for the case of this pink
line a direction vector would be three
negative two now what if K doesn't equal
zero
what changing K does is it shifts the
line off of the origin it doesn't
actually change the direction of the
line at all so a direction vector for ax
plus B y equals K regardless of what K
is we'll still be B negative a so both
the pink and green lines will have three
negative two as direction vectors one
reason this way of looking at the
equation ax plus B y equals K is
important is that it gives us an
implicit description of the line as a
single equation in particular as the set
of points such that a particular vector
dotted with those coordinates x and y
equals a given number K this form also
lets us quickly read off the coordinates
for a vector that is orthogonal to the
line also called a normal vector to the
line in this case a normal vector for
the line 2x plus 3y equals 6 will be 2 3
since any vector that is parallel to
this line will be orthogonal to the
vector 2
we will explore this concept further
when we look at planes in three
dimensions as well as when we start
using linear algebra to solve systems of
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
