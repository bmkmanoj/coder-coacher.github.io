code and then we'll leave a crucial part
of it for you to do as a quiz you should
feel free at any point to stop and try
to figure out more of the code on your
own there are lots of different ways to
do this and we'll show you one and
you'll finish that as a quiz so the
first thing we're going to do is define
two constants so we're going to use D as
the damping factor and i'll use 0.8 as
my damping factor that's the probability
thinking about our random web surfer
that she selects a link on the current
page rather than starting over with a
new random page the other constant I'm
going to define here will call num loops
that's the number of times we're going
to go through the relaxation what we're
computing is the value of rank at some
time step the number of times we go
through that is going to determine the
accuracy of our ranks will use 10 as the
number of loops you can experiment with
changing that and one of the questions
in the homework assignment will ask you
to think about what happens when you
change that so now we need to start we
said initially the rank of each URL is
one divided by the number of pages and
so the dictionary ranks we want to
initialize with those values so we're
going to create an empty dictionary will
call it ranks the number of pages the
number of pages we can get from the
graph the graph is a dictionary of nodes
and land of graph will tell us the
number of entries in that dictionary so
that's the number of nodes in the graph
which is the number of pages that we
crawled and now we want to go through
the pages initializing each page to the
value 1 divided by n pages and I'm
remembering to use 1.0 here to make sure
the division is done as floating-point
division and we get an accurate number
rather than integer division so now
we've initialized the ranks we have a
dictionary that map's each page to its
current rank which is one divided by the
number of pages so now we get to the
interesting part we need a loop that's
going to go through the number of times
of Numb loops each time through this
loop what we want to do is update the
new ranks based on this formula using
the old ranks and then at the end of the
loop we're going to make the variable
ranks hold what was pre
obviously new ranks and that way we can
keep going each time we're going to get
a new value for new ranks at the end of
doing all the updates we're going to
update ranks to refer to whatever new
ranks did so that means each time
through this loop we're going to create
a new dictionary called new ranks that
starts as empty and we're going to add
all the pages to new ranks as we update
their rank so to do that we need to go
through the pages in the graph and for
each page what we want to do is compute
the new rank for that page and the first
thing we'll do is this part the new rank
is one minus D divided by n pages plus
this summation so the first thing we'll
do is introduce a new variable will call
it new rank and we'll assign it to this
value then we're going to update it as
we go through the pages that link into
this page so we'll start by initializing
new rank as one minus D divided by the
number of pages so then what we need to
do is update for the summation and I'm
going to leave this blank and I'm going
to skip that for now this is going to be
left as a quiz will finish the rest of
the code and then your quiz will be to
finish this part of the code which is
really the most interesting part of
computing the page ranks once we've done
that so we use new rank as our variable
to keep track of the rank for this page
but we want to update our dictionary so
we're going to add an entry new ranks
we're still within the for loop you're
going to put your code that sums up all
the links here once we've done that
we've got the value of new rank that
reflects both the probability of
starting from that page and the
popularity from all the end links and so
we'll update this to be a new rank we've
added that to our dictionary so once
we've finished looping through all the
pages in the graph well now we're ready
for the next step so that means we want
to make the variable ranks refer to the
new ranks so we've changed the time step
to the next time step and now we're
going to go back through this loop and
we go through this loop number of loops
times each time we're updating the ranks
and when we're done what we want to
return is ranks that's the dictionary
that map's each page to its rank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
