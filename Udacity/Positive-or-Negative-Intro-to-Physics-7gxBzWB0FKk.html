made a mistake so let's look at our
variables well we said the initial
velocity was 20 meters per second yeah
that was absolutely true we threw it up
at 20 meters per second we said the
final velocity was zero can't really
argue that at the top of the trajectory
it does have to stop for a brief instant
and we said the acceleration was 10 and
that's meters per second squared where
on earth isn't that always the
acceleration well here's where we have
to be careful when we said that the
initial velocity was positive 20 we made
a choice we said hey in this problem up
is positive now we were free to make
that choice we could have sit down as
positive too but once we make our choice
we're no longer free acceleration
objects always accelerate downwards they
accelerate towards the earth they don't
spring up off the earth so if we've
chosen up is positive we have to choose
a as negative since it points downwards
and if we carry that out we get a
positive 20 here and so the maximum
height is 20 meters remember whenever
you make a calculation in physics you
are calculating something about the real
world if your number doesn't make sense
in the real world you did something
wrong this is nice because it's a
built-in sanity check we can always
check to see that our number isn't
totally crazy and we know if it is
totally crazy we made a mistake if it's
not we still may have made a mistake but
we feel more confident better answer one
more question before we move on in this
one you throw a ball again straight up
between meters per second but now I want
to know how long does it take to reach
the highest point enter your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
