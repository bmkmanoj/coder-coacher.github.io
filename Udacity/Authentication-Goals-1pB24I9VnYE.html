authentication process itself
so remember authentication in a nutshell
is a user convincing a system who he or
she is so using some technique or some
method so obviously we're talking about
a user associated with a certain
identity username for example wanting to
authenticate herself to the system
whatever authentication method we use
what do we desire from it what should be
its goal first of all when a legitimate
user tries to authenticate herself the
system can demand some evidence but when
the right evidence is provided the
system should allow the login to
complete successfully well that is
called availability the system is
available to the user who is able to
provide the right evidence to support
the claim for example the user is Alice
so the system should be available to the
legitimate user who is able to provide
the correct evidence in other words we
don't want to have any false negatives
okay so let's just spend a little bit of
time on what do we mean by this phrase
false negative that I have here so
negative reference to the outcome so if
the authentication process is
successfully completes that is a
positive outcome a negative outcome is
when we deny the authentication request
or the login request so we for some
reason believe the evidence is not right
or whatever it is so we're going to say
login unsuccessful for example or
authentication unsuccessful if it's the
right user providing the right evidence
and the system still has a negative
outcome
well that is incorrect in fact that
outcome we see is not a correct outcome
that result is false the user was the
right one with the right evidence
whatever method we are using perhaps has
a problem and because of that it's not
able to allow the user n so if the
outcome is negative and that's done
incorrectly that is called a false
negative so false negative basically
means when we incorrectly deny access or
incorrectly decline an authentic
in request we don't want to have that we
have an authentication method we don't
want it to deny authentication requests
for right users who provide the right
evidence well the other possibility is
the bad person Eve is trying to
impersonate her so Eve walks up to the
system and says I am Alice so it's the
user principle that is associated with
the identity which is Alice it's really
not her and it's Eve so the user a
principal who is not associated with
Alice's identity we don't want that
person or Eve to be able to login well
if you had a guarantee then we have
authenticity in in the authentication
process if we authenticate someone we
know for sure that it is that person so
that's the authenticity part and another
way to sort of think about this is that
we don't want to have any false
positives so positive here refers to the
outcome of the authentication process
positive means we allow someone to log
in or authenticate and false means we
actually make a mistake we do that
incorrectly if Eve is able to log in as
Alice that is not right that's incorrect
so that's a false positive so we don't
want to have any false positives
the second goal that we have for
authentication is that the right user
with the right identity and evidence
should be allowed in that means we have
no false negatives and somebody who's
trying to impersonate a user of the
system should not be allowed in which
means we should not have any false
positives so these are the goals of a
good authentication method that you
would want to implement in your system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
