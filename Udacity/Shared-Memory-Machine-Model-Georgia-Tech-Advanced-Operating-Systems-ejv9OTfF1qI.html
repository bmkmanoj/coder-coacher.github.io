become fundamental to computer systems
any general purpose CPU chip has
multiple cores in it every gel purpose
operating system is designed to take
advantage of such Hardware parallelism
in this unit we will study the basic
algorithms for synchronization
communication and scheduling in a shared
memory multiprocessor leading up to the
structure of the operating system for
parallel machines we will start today's
lecture with a discussion of the model
of a parallel machine a shared memory
multiprocessor or a shared memory
machine we can think of three different
structures for this shared memory
machine the first structure is what we
call a dancehall architecture and a
dancehall architecture is one in which
you have CPUs on one side and the memory
on the other side of an interconnection
network and let me say something that is
common to all the three structures that
I'm going to describe to you the common
things are that in every one of these
structures there's going to be CPUs and
they're going to be memory and there's
going to be an interconnection network
and the key thing is it's a shared
memory machine what that means is that
the entire address space defined by the
memories is accessible from any of the
CPUs so that's one common thing that
you'll see in all the three styles that
I'm going to talk to you about and in
addition to that you'll see that there
is a cache that is associated with each
of these CPUs so there's a dancehall
architecture and the next style is what
is called an SMP architecture or a
symmetric multiprocessor here what you
see is the interconnection network that
I showed you from the dancehall
architecture I've simplified it
considerably showing a simple bus a
system bus that connects all the CPUs to
talk to the main memory and and the
symmetric because the access time from
any of the CPUs memory is the same and
that's the idea of the system bus it
allows all of these CPUs to talk to the
main memory the other thing that you'll
notice as I already mentioned is that
every CPU comes equipped with a cache
and we will talk more about
the shared memory machine the caches in
a minute so the third style of
architecture is what is called a
distributed shared memory architecture
so in this distributed shared memory
architecture what you have are dsm for
short is that you have memory a piece of
memory that is associated with each CPU
and at the same time each CPU is able to
access all of the memories through the
interconnection network it is just that
the access to memory that is close to
this guy is going to be obviously faster
than trying to access memory that is
farther from here which has to be
accessed through the interconnection
network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
