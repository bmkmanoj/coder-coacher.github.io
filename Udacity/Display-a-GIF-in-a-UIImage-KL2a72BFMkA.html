writing the code to display a gif if we
haven't converted the video to a gift
yet the answer is it's easier to test
the gift conversion code if we can see
the gif a uiimageview off the shelf
doesn't have the ability to display a
gif let's see how the gif was displayed
in the objective-c project if we go into
the Welcome View controller and look in
the view will appear method we can see
where this variable first launched gif
is being initialized if we command click
on this init with name method it'll take
us inside the gift class here we can see
that the image is being set with a call
to this method animated image with
animated gif name okay where's this
method let's see if we scroll up we can
see that animated gif with animated gif
name is a part of this extension that
Rob may have wrote the UI image plus
animated gif extension this seems like
it's getting a little complicated but
guess what our new ball lo has an
extension that does exactly what we need
and it's written in Swift so let's
switch back to our Swift project and go
ahead and add a new file called UI image
plus gif you can find a link to the
github repo containing balos swift gif
extension in the corresponding text if
we go into his repository and we go into
the Swift gif common folder we can see
this UI image plus gift Swift file go
ahead and copy this code and put it into
the Swift file you just made make sure
that you copy this copyright information
as well so that valo gets proper credit
next we want to hook up the storyboard
outlet for our welcome view controllers
gif image view so let's open up the
storyboard and we'll open up the
assistant editor and we'll hook up the
gif image view next we want to set the
gif image view here and view will appear
if we go back to github we can see here
in our nabela's readme for the UI image
extension how to use the extension I'm
going to call this proof-of-concept gift
for now and then
we'll call you I image and then the
method gif with name and then you'll
notice that I've included couple gifts
to get you guys started in the project
hotline bling' is the name of one of
them and then we need to set the image
on our gif image view to be the proof of
concept gif and of course we don't want
to forget to call super so we'll make
sure to call super view will appear and
now we should be ready to run it and
when we run it sweet
there's Drake now when we convert our
video into a gif we'll be able to
display it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
