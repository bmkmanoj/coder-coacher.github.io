following broad topics we'll start by
returning to the topic of optimizing GPU
programs now in unit 5 we gave some
pretty specific detailed advice and unit
6 explored some examples of how to think
parallel here we're going to back off
and talk more generally about strategies
that parallel programmers use to
optimize their programs now the best
kind of programming as we mentioned
briefly in unit 5 is the kind of
programming that you don't do because
somebody else has already programmed it
for you and packaged it into a library
you can use so we'll talk about some
important and useful CUDA libraries that
are out there some of these libraries
are less about packaging up code to
solve a particular problem and more
about providing what I call programming
power tools to help code up your own
solutions so examples familiar to C++
programmers would be the standard
template library or stl or the boost
library we'll discuss a few such power
tools for CUDA C++ programmers now
throughout this class we focused on the
CUDA C++ language but there are many
other platforms for parallel programming
on GPUs we'll talk about CUDA platforms
that support other languages from
Fortran to Python to MATLAB and we'll
also discuss cross-platform accelerator
solutions like opencl open ACC and
OpenGL compute now GPU computing is a
young field and part of what makes it
exciting is that the hardware and
software are improving each year not
just getting incrementally faster but
also adding fundamentally new
capabilities so we're going to finish
the unit and the course with a fantastic
guest lecture inviting dr. Steven Jones
from Nvidia to come and teach us about
the latest advance in cuda called
dynamic parallelism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
