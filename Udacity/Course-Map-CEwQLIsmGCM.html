that build on one another you'll start
in the wrapping stage where you'll be
learning the syntax of constructing
promises a promise constructor in and of
itself isn't super useful so from there
you'll be learning how to react to the
resolution of a promise if all goes well
you'll want to then off the promise or
if something breaks you'll want to catch
the air these are the Venning and the
catching stages you'll spend the whole
second lesson in the chaining stage
where you'll learn how to create long
sequences of asynchronous work it's also
worth going over some promise vocabulary
I'm stealing these definitions from Jake
Archibald who wrote a fantastic guide on
promises that you can find in the
instructor notes there are four states
of promise can have you'll pick up these
terms pretty quickly but I recommend
jotting them down on a piece of paper to
help out as you're going through the
course here they are
the first one is fulfilled and that
means that the action related to the
promise succeeded this state is also
known as resolved then there is rejected
and this means that the action related
to the promise failed the next one is
pending which means that the promise has
not yet fulfilled or rejected and then
finally they're settled which means that
the promise has either fulfilled or
rejected okay now that you've got the
terms behind promises and you know where
we're going in the course it's time to
examine how and when promises are
executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
