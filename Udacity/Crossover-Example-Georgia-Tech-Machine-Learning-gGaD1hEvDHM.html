crossover and so it turns out that the
crossover operation is always going to
depend critically on how you represent
the input space so let's say concretely
that our input spaces is 8-bit strings
so here's two parents 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
and 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 and we're going to
introduce them to each other all right
now they know each other and now we're
going to use them to create a new
individual a new offspring so they're
really going to know each other all
right now we've put these two bit
sequences together and we've lined up so
that the bits correspond in each of the
different positions and now we can ask
how can we use this to generate a new
individual that uses elements of the two
individuals that we had I have you many
ways to do that ok what do you got I
have lots of ways but I don't think any
of them can be reproduced for the
purposes of this learning lesson all
right well so let's let's do ones that
really kind of stick to the bit patterns
I swear there's no way you could say
this without getting in trouble Michael
all right but that's ok so how about
here's an obvious one right if we if we
really push the genetic notion as far as
we can then you know each of those
things represent I don't know alleles or
some other biological term and so what
happens in genetics right as you mix and
Max your chromosomes and your alleles
together so why don't I say one child is
the first 4 bits of this handsome
Charles fellow and the last four bits of
this beautiful and wonderful Sheila
person all right I see what you're doing
there so what you're saying is we're
going to pick well maybe this isn't
quite what you said but I'm not
imagining that what you said is we pick
a random position along the sequence and
you said at the halfway point and what
we're going to do is now mix and match
and create two offspring one uses the
first half of Charles and the second
half of Sheila and then the other one is
the other way around and as you can see
it's this last bit that determines the
sex anyway so these are the two
offspring that these two individuals
have generated and this particular way
of of combining where you randomly
choose a position
and then flip-flop is called one point
crossover all right so now I want you to
think about this for a second Charles so
I don't know if it's an inductive bias
but what kind of bias do we put in when
we say well we're going to choose one of
these points and we're going to
flip-flop based on where that point is
chosen what is that what is that going
to do what kind of offspring is that
going to generate huh so you know what I
see - I see two kind of assumptions
built there so maybe that is an
inductive ice so or a bias of some sort
so one assumption is that locality of
the bits matter good right so the first
by picking halfway through you're saying
the first four bits are somehow related
and the last four bits are somehow
related because otherwise it would make
any sense now to talk about them being
together and that brings me to my second
point which I guess really is just the
first point which is that it assumes
that there are sub parts of the space
that can be kind of independently
optimized that you can then put together
right and in particular when I say
subspace is to optimize I mean that
they're independent part of the
subspaces so that's actually the example
that you gave before you said well
there's these two dimensions and each
dimension kind of matters independently
and the total reward or the total the
total fitness is some kind of linear
combination of them and so I can put
them because if those two things aren't
true then really doing crossover like
this won't help you at all you're just
kind of randomly mixing things together
it's kind of an assumption about the way
the space works in that kind of like the
example what we did when we were doing
bit guessing that that you could be
heading in a good direction that there's
pieces that are right and if we reuse
those pieces we can get even righter
sure all right so and if it is the case
that the the sequence of the ordering of
the bits matters we have this locality
property this is actually a fairly
sensible thing to do but can you imagine
any other way of combining these bits
together to get to get offspring well I
can think of a lot well so let's let's
focus you know you have many different
possible ideas but let's focus on ideas
where we still have this sub space to
optimize property but we don't really
have a locality of bits property
we don't really the ordering doesn't
matter anymore so keeping them clumped
together like that we don't think that
that's useful thing okay well what would
that mean tell me what that means
well so the one-point crossover when we
talked about that it really matters that
you know the two bits that are next to
each other are very likely to stay
connected right that is it's it's
unlikely that the split will happen to
happen exactly between them and so
they'll tend to travel as a group but if
we don't think it's important that the
bits that are next to each other need to
travel together if we say that it should
be equally likely for any of the bits to
kind of remain together we need to cross
over a lot more than just that one time
and in a sense we might need to cross
over every time well so what I'm trying
to get at here is this notion that what
we could do is we can generate
individuals by just scrambling at each
bit position so the first bit position
maybe we stays the same the second one
flips the third one stays the same
the fourth one stays the same the fifth
one flips the sixth one stays the same
seventh one flips and the eighth one
stays the same so now we've got two
individuals and every bit from for these
individuals comes from one of the
parents and so that means that if
there's little sub pieces that are
correct that may be preserved in the
offspring but no longer does it matter
what the ordering is we get exactly the
same distribution over offspring no
matter how we order the bits okay
so this idea is sometimes called uniform
crossover and essentially we're just
randomizing at each bit position this
kind of crossover happens biologically
at the level of genes right so we we
imagine that we get our genes from our
parents but the for each different gene
like the gene for eyes and the gene for
hair color are not particularly linked
to each other that they're uniformly
chosen at each position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
