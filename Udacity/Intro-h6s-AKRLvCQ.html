metropolitan about computer vision for
the rest of the day because I am like
going nuts already recording all these
lectures and I have to do something
differently however as my children will
tell you my singing about anything is
generally a bad idea so let's chat
instead so last time we were talking
about motion this is within this general
context and we talked about that if
you're looking locally you can't
actually tell the direction of motion of
a pixel and that was referred to as this
aperture problem remember this little
demo where we said that even though the
actual thing is moving sideways and down
a little bit you see it as moving
upwards because the only part that you
can see that edge all you can tell is
the direction of motion in the direction
of the gradient and we showed that here
that that was derived from our
brightness constraint equations where we
showed that the U V dotted with the
gradient has to be the negative of I T
that's what that equation says but any
UV any motion whose component
perpendicular to the edge along the
gradient is the same would be an
acceptable UV so we needed some
additional constraints so last time we
talked about in introducing some global
requirement we talked about a smoothness
constraint that would allow us to
optimize a solution over the entire
image but today we're gonna look at more
local and frankly much more effective or
certainly more commonly used methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
