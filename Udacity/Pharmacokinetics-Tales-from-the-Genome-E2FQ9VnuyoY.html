containing alcohol or more specifically
ethanol it gets metabolized in the liver
there are two really important enzymes
that are necessary for the first two
steps of alcohol metabolism the first is
an enzyme called a th or alcohol
dehydrogenase and the second is aldh2 or
aldehyde dehydrogenase to now if this
was a chemistry class I would make you
sort of learn the chemical structure of
each of these intermediates but we're
not going to do that we're just going to
use the words and we're going to
symbolize them with these little visuals
here ethanol is a very small molecule
and this ADH all dehydrogenase is going
to catalyze the first step of the
metabolism here and turn ethanol into
acetaldehyde these little red circles
the next step in the metabolism pathway
is for aldh2 to turn acetaldehyde into
acetic acid this whole lesson will
revolve around these two steps right
here in particular the activity of the
ADH and the aldh2 enzymes as with most
anything in life it takes time for these
proteins to perform their function so
before there's any acetic acid around
aldh2 has to take the acetaldehyde on it
into acid and before there's any
acetaldehyde a take the ethanol and turn
it into acetaldehyde so when you consume
a lot of alcohol H gets busy turning it
into acetaldehyde but if you drink a lot
of alcohol the ADH can only work so fast
and so you end up with a buildup of the
ethanol in your bloodstream now ethanol
is the molecule that causes many of the
effects we associate with intoxication
so the more alcohol you drink the busier
your ADH will be and at some point it
gets saturated and the drug world this
just means that all of its active sites
are occupied it can't do what it's doing
any faster thus there's the build-up of
alcohol and we get intoxicated symptoms
of intoxication includes slurred speech
euphoria and
balance loss of muscle coordination and
many other symptoms that some of you
might even be familiar with now as the
ADH metabolizes the alcohol into
acetaldehyde these symptoms of
intoxication decrease now the speed with
which alcohol is broken down to
acetaldehyde and then on to the other
steps it's what's referred to as
pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetics from
the greek Kinesis meaning movement in
this case drug movement through the body
specifically the breakdown of drugs
through metabolism in other words
pharmacokinetics is what the body does
to a drug this includes absorption
distribution metabolism and excretion so
based on this information I want you to
tell me which of the following mutations
in a th or alcohol dehydrogenase would
result in a pharmacokinetic change where
the person would rarely feel intoxicated
would it be someone with a mutation
causing reduced ADH activity or someone
with the mutation causing enhanced ADH
activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
