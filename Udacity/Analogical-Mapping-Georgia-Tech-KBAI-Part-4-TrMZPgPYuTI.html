the problem here is called a
correspondence problem there are a
number of obviously relationships in
this target problem there are a number
of obviously relationships in this
source case what in the target problem
corresponds to what in the source case
if we can address the correspondence
problem if we can say for example the
laser beam corresponds to the rebel army
then we can start aligning the target
problem in the source case so that it
makes the deep similarities between
relationships salient notice as several
objects and target problem and several
in the source case in principle any of
this august and target problem could
correspond any of the obvious in the
source case in which case would have a
m2n mapping and that becomes
computationally inefficient yet you and
I often do not have much of a problem
deciding the relays abhi must correspond
to the rebel army how do we do it and
how can we help air agents make similar
kind of correspondences our answer is
we'll make use of relationships in fact
we will make use of higher-order
relationships whenever possible we'll
give precedence to higher order
relationships over other relationships
as a unitary relationship we might say
that it is a patient as a person here
and King as a person there the binary
relationship you might say that a
physician has a resource the laser beam
and the rebel army has a resource the
army itself as a higher order
relationship a tertiary relationship
between say that between the goal and
the resource is an obstacle the healthy
tissue in this case similarly between
the goal and the resource is an obstacle
the mines in this case will focus on the
higher order relationship there that's
with the deepest similarity between the
two situations like this is how we know
to map between the king and the tumor
and not between the king and the patient
although the king of the patient is
superficially similar the deeper
similarity lies and viewing the king and
the tumor in terms of goals which need
to be cured or captured using a resource
when there is an obstacle in between
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
