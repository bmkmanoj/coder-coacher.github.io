we learned a definition for feature
selection which was getting a subset of
the features to feed to some I think we
mostly talked about supervised training
algorithms or learning algorithms after
the selection has taken place right we
made a distinction between trapping and
filtering was that supposed to be
filtering yeah I didn't know how to
filtering sounds sounded more like
slurping yeah i'm not sure that my
rapping actually sounded like rapping
either it didn't but i wasn't going to
say anything so what else did we learn
besides you like sound effects so we
learned about feature selection we
define that we discuss the difference
between filtering methods for feature
selection and wrapping message for
future selection what do we learn about
them that wrapping is slow but actually
seems like it solves the problem that
matters yeah so let's call that slow but
useful is that useful in the sense yes
find it mm-hmm or these can be useful
where's filtering is simpler possibly
faster but maybe misses the point
probably faster you know but ignores
bias okay so what else is that it well
so we end we specifically learned about
the distinction between features being
useful versus them being relevant that's
right so relevant things are things that
give you information about the
classification problem or the regression
problems you care about but useful
features are things that help you to
actually do the learning given some
specific algorithm right and you
reminded me what a Bayes optimal
classifier which I guess I should have
known already but somehow it didn't I
didn't understand how it fit into this
context well the the main power of Bayes
optimal classifiers is that it's sort of
the gold standard it's the ultimate that
you could do if you had everything and
all the time in the world could I say
that relevance is usefulness with regard
to the Bayes optimal classifier yes
actually you could I like that it's a
special case in this oh wait there's
something else that you taught you
talked about which we
strong and weak relevance right and in a
sense that relevant features have a kind
of kryptonite in the sense that you can
make them not strong just by putting a
copy of them into the space right I like
that the Kryptonite is copy well then
that's because you're no longer
indispensable if I have a copy of it
that's right you and your evil twin now
resides in your parallel universe so
what do you think that means for us are
we strongly relevant weekly relevant or
useless and those are your choices I am
I'm gonna say I'm weekly relevant
because I think I correlate with truth
assuming the subset of other people in
the world is the empty tent fair enough
fair enough so then by that definition
do i get to be weekly relevant you're at
least weekly relevant mmm very good very
good but are we useful we're gonna say
yes as far as our students know well I
guess that's what the way we'll find out
altima tlie is how will they do on the
course it's true it's it's in some sense
completely in their hands right so in
fact this course is a wrapper method /
features no this is the first iteration
interesting well that was deep I feel
like we should end on that I 22 okay
well then I will see you next time when
we will talk about feature
transformation transformation' well done
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
