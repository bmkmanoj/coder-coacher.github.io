photography let's not forget the most
basic element of computational
photography still a camera camera like
this one this was actually built in the
about the mid-1950s and was given to my
father by his father and I was lucky
enough to get it from my father recently
this was the first camera I ever used to
take my first ever picture the bottom
line with all cameras is there's still
the same in principle what they do is
they capture rays of light and get it to
a sensor which could be a digital sensor
or film and that pipeline is then used
to create a photograph in this lecture
we will talk about that pipeline how
rays of light are brought onto a sensor
to generate a picture the most basic
example of that camera is a pinhole
camera and the concept of pinhole
photography was known even in the early
300 BC but in about the early 1800s that
was converted into creating cameras and
from there on lot more efforts went into
building optics and lenses that were
then used to create better cameras in
this lecture we will talk about the
pinhole camera and we'll talk about the
use of lenses to actually get the right
kinds of rays of light to the right
location so we can actually store images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
