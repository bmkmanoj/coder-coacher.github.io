you're going to look at is using course
green session beads in this structure
that I'm showing you we're only looking
at the web container and the EJB
container because the applet container
that interfaces with the client is in
the web browser so we don't worry about
that we will talk only about how we
structure the web container and the EJB
container in the different design
alternatives so the web container
contains the presentation logic and in
the structure that I'm showing you a
servlet corresponds to an individual
session with a particular client so this
box represents a particular client this
box represents a second client and
there's a presentation logic
commensurate with servlet one that is
client number one and similarly
presentation logic commensurate with
servlet two which is client number two
and there is a coarse-grained session
being that is associated with each of
these servlet and in turn the session
bean corresponds to the client that is
being served through the servlet number
one and similarly servlet number two is
served by the session bean and as the
name suggests the session being is
responsible for the specific needs of
the particular client that it is serving
for this particular session
therefore the session being we'll worry
about the data accesses that are needed
to the database in order for the
business logic to do its thing so if
let's say we are doing an airline
reservation system and if this is
requesting a particular booking then the
session bean is going to be the one that
contacts the database server in order to
pull the specific dates and airline
reservation information that is needed
for the business logic to do the pruning
and selection commensurate with whatever
this particular client has requested and
there are multiple sessions that are
contained in this EJB container
depending on the number of clients that
have simultaneously temporally made
requests to this
particular service so the EJB container
has to provide some service for all the
sessions that are concurrently going on
in this server all of the data accesses
that are needed for a particular session
is taken care of by the session beam and
therefore the amount of help that we
need from the EJB container in terms of
services is pretty minimal
for supporting this particular model and
and in fact it is confined to any
conflicts that might arise in terms of
external accesses for satisfying the
request of these different session beans
so the EJB container service that would
be needed is primarily for coordinating
if any across concurrent independent
sessions an example would be if they
want to access the same portion of the
database for writing some records in
that case they may need some
coordination help from the EJB container
service the other important attribute of
the structure is that the business logic
is confined to the corporate network it
is not exposed to the outside world
because it is not contained in the web
container it is contained in the EJB
container and therefore the business
logic is not exposed beyond the
corporate network that's a good thing so
the pros of this particular structure is
that you need minimal container services
and also that the business logic is not
exposed to the outside world but the
cons for this particular structure is
this application structure is very akin
to a monolithic kernel that we've talked
about a lot there is very limited
concurrency for accessing different
parts of the database for instance I
mentioned that these services provided
by these giant scale services tend to be
embarassingly parallel so the lots of
opportunities for pulling in data
example would be lets say that the
particular query is to compile
demographic distribution of all the
employees in the company in that case
there is an opportunity to pull in
soft data simultaneously from the
database but unfortunately the structure
doesn't allow you to exploit such
concurrency so in other words this
course green session beam structure
represents a last opportunity for
accessing and pulling lots of data from
the database in parallel for satisfying
either the same request or even
concurrent requests that may be
accessing the same portions of the same
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
