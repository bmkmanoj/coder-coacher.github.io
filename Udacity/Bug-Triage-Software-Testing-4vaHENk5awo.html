severity of different bugs is determined
and we start to disambiguate between
different bugs I'm gonna basically try
to get a handle on which bugs we can
report in parallel and so the deal is is
that any inputs that trigger separate
bugs can be reported in parallel but if
we report all of the bug triggering
inputs that we found what we're gonna do
is be causing a lot of duplicate bug
reports and one of the golden rules of
reporting bugs and I'll go over this a
little bit later in more detail is that
you don't report and duplicate bugs this
wears on developers incredibly much and
they'll soon get tired of you and start
ignoring you and I say this from
experience I've reported quite a few
duplicate bug myself and it's not that
fun people don't like it the question
now is what is bug triage I mean how do
we start getting a handle on which bug
trigger your inputs map to different
bugs and which ones mapped to the same
bugs and basically there is no silver
bullet here what we have is we're gonna
see is there's a number of different
weapons we can use to disambiguate bugs
and so in easiest possible case the bugs
in the system are causing assertion
violation messages so one thing we can
do is disambiguate based on assertion
violations what I basically mean here is
that you do what I gave a demonstration
of doing a little bit earlier which is
you just look at the text of the
desertion violation messages and you go
ahead and make the assumption that
distinct assertion violation messages
are caused by distinct bugs in the
software under test and that doesn't
need to be true not too long ago I
reported something like 6 bugs in the
LLVM compiler they had completely
distinct symptoms that is to say
completely distinct assertion violation
messages but they were all traced back
to a single error in the source code and
so of course that kind of thing can
happen and that's especially common if
the underlying bug in the software under
test is some sort of a memory safety
violation that is to say we have a C or
C++ program that starts corrupting its
own internal memory and in that case a
single bug can map to any number of
symptoms one possibility is that we have
a single root cause it's a defect in the
software under test that can map
multiple outputs that look different so
this is one possibility
and this happens although maybe not that
often another possibility is that we can
have multiple defects that all cause the
same symptom and this is actually really
common for example in a big C or C++
program like a web browser it's very
common for multiple memory safety
defects that is to say multiple bugs
that include things like buffer overruns
and low point ID references it's all
have the same symptom which is
segmentation fault so that happens
really commonly now in contrast with
these slightly pathological cases what
we hope happens and this is also
relatively common is it a single defect
maps to a single symptom and by
reporting a test
leading to that symptom we can get that
defect fixed and so in this case we have
many defects all mapping to their own
symptoms in the output space we can
report these in parallel and that's
really nice and like I was saying with
large complicated software that's
evolving rapidly reporting bugs in
parallel may be our only option if we
want to actually get the number of
defects in the software under control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
