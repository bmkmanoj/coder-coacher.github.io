about is digital cash what we want to do
is find some way to use numbers to
simulate something that would be similar
may be better to maybe worse than
physical cash so what are the properties
that physical cash has at least the
properties we might want it to have well
it should have a universally recognized
value that means everyone agrees that
it's worth something it should be easy
to transfer between two individuals that
means you can transfer it without having
to talk to a bank or some trusted third
party some might are you against this
including some governments but many
individuals would like their cash to be
anonymous and untraceable not all
governments want this but let's assume
that as an individual that we do want or
cash to be anonymous and untraceable
we'd like it to be light and portable
easy to carry and we'd like to be hard
to copy our Forge if someone can
counterfeit the money well it probably
won't have recognized value for very
long so assuming that we do want these
five properties which of these does us
paper currency satisfy well and I
apologize for specifying us I know many
of you are not in the US and have
different paper currencies you can
answer this for your currency I'm going
to answer this for what I think about us
paper cash it's definitely a subjective
question but we'll talk about what I
think the right answer is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
