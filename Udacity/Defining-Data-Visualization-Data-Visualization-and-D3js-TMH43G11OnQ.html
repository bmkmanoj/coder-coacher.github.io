consulted some experts to learn more
about the field here's what they had to
say hi everyone I'm here with Scott
Murray Scott could you introduce
yourself sure I'm an assistant professor
here at the University of San Francisco
where I teach in the design program I
teach some of our intro classes but I
also teach interaction design and
information visualization and the author
of the book interactive data
visualization for the web and
introduction to designing with d3 so
Scott what is data visualization well
there's obviously a lot of different
possible answers to that but I like to
think about data visualization as
mapping not sort of making Geographic
maps like traditionally how we think
about mass but mapping the how years to
visuals so I teach a class on
information visualization it's it's sort
of about information broadly but we're
talking about data visualization I think
of data as being kind of structured
information so if you have a spreadsheet
you have rows and columns you have sort
of information that's not just
loosey-goosey but it's organized in some
sort of structured way
so the visualization part is taking that
data and figuring out ways to translate
that into visuals that are more readily
understood so instead of reading these
columns of numbers we can look at you
know these pictures of bars or lines or
shapes or whatever different colors hi
everyone I'm here with cole nussbaumer
who's a blogger with storytelling with
data she's here to share some insights
about data visualization and share some
tips about how you can get started in
the field so Cole first tell us what is
data visualization so for me data
visualization is about turning numbers
into pictures and into stories there's
something about making data visual that
allows us to explore and understand the
data in a different way our visual
system is actually really fast at
processing information so good data
visualization can lend itself to this
sort of aha moment of understanding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
