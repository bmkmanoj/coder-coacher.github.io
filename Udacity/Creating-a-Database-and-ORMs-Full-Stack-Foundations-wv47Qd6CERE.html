create an application where I can make
various restaurant menus with various
items often within one application all
restaurant menus in the general sense
contain the same thing some have a few
appetizers some entrees a few desserts
and of course some beverages to keep
things simple let's call all of these
things menu items and all of my menu
items belong to a specific restaurant
menu it also would be helpful to have a
price and brief description for each of
our menu items an important early design
decision to make is how to model my
database there is more than one correct
way to structure a database but there's
no need to make things too complicated
let's walk through the process of making
a database layout together we have a
restaurant table to represent all the
restaurants in our database along with a
corresponding name and ID number then we
have a table of menu items each menu
item will have a name an ID a
description a price and of course to
categorize whether it is an appetizer
entree dessert or beverage we will also
provide a restaurant ID to assign a
foreign key relationship with our
restaurant table okay so we've planned
out how we will design our database now
let's get to coding it up if you've used
SQL before you might be used to writing
something like this if you're not an SQL
expert it might be a little hard to
understand though now there's nothing
wrong with this code but let's take a
look at it for a second using raw SQL we
have to send queries to the database of
strings this works but our Python
compiler has no way of helping me if I
make a typo or reference a table that
doesn't exist every other data structure
we use in Python is some type of object
so why not treat our database queries
tables and rows as objects as well well
this concern isn't a unique one and
developers have created tools for this
very problem object relational mapper 0
RMS can be thought of like a translator
converting our code from one form to
another
if we send off code written in Python or
any other preferred programming language
it is transformed by the ORM into SQL
and sent off to our database the ORM
also gets results from an SQL statement
and allows us to use it as an object
from within our Python code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
