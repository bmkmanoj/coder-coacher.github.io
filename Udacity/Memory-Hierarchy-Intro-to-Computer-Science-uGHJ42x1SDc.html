hard to understand so what I want to do
to give a better understanding of what
the different types of memory in a
computer are is turn those into
different units and compare them so if
we think about the light bulb switch
which certainly would not be a
reasonable way to store memory in a
computer today the cost per bit is
probably about 50 cents so it can buy
light bulbs for about 50 cents let's
assume the sensing is free it's already
going to be ridiculously expensive so
I'll call it US dollars 50 cents per bit
for using a light bulb and a light
sensor the latency is about one second
and what we're gonna do in the quiz is
convert Layton sees in terms of time in
terms of the equivalent for the distance
light travels in that amount of time the
other type of memory I mentioned and we
didn't see this because it's sort of
hard to extract from the computer is the
CPU register and the registers are part
of the processor so it's hard to measure
their actual cost it's probably close to
a tenth of a cent though if we look at
the total cost of the processor and how
that depends on the number of registers
you have the amount of memory that you
have in registers is close to a kilobyte
or two in a typical processor only a few
thousand bytes in the registers the
latency is the shortest of any of these
it's less than a nanosecond and the time
to get memory from a register has to be
short enough that you can do it within a
single cycle so we saw our cycle speed
for the processor was 2.7 gigahertz that
means we need to do 2.7 billion cycles
in a second the time of a cycle is less
than 0.4 nanoseconds within a given
cycle we at least need to be able to get
memory out of register so that's an
approximation of the time there so we'll
measure the latency distance in terms of
meters for light so the third type of
memory we've talked about so far as the
DRAM the cost per bit for the DRAM
well our DRAM costs about ten dollars
and it stores two gigabytes so in order
to write down the cost per bit we really
need a new unit
if we try to write it in terms of
dollars in the sense it's gonna be far
too hard to see so to fit DRAM into this
well DRAM it cost 10 US dollars for two
gigabytes if we want to write that in
terms of a meaningful cost per bit we
need a new kind of currency we're going
to need far too many zeros before we get
to the value using regular dollars and
cents so we're going to use a new kind
of currency so to measure the costs of
DRAM in a meaningful way we need a new
kind of currency which we'll call a nano
dollar a nano dollar is one billionth of
a dollar so if we have a billion nano
dollars that would make one dollar and I
don't have one of these on paper it's
money that's really not worth the paper
that it's printed on but it's a useful
unit for measuring the cost per bit so
now we have a more useful currency for
measuring the cost per bit of DRAM and
the cost of DRAM turns out to be in
terms of nano dollars 0.58 nano dollars
per bit and we saw that latency for DRAM
was 12 nano seconds so now for the quiz
I want you to figure out the latency
distance for each of these different
types of memory note that the units are
different here we use dollars in nano
dollars for the distances where you use
kilometers meters and meters and you've
got all the information you have here as
a reminder the speed of light is about
300,000 kilometers per second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
