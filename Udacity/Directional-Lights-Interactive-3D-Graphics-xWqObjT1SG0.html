you like since ultimately the effect of
a light is something computed in the
vertex or fragment shader that said
there are a few different common forms
of lights used in applications the
simplest is called a directional light
this type of light is defined by just
that a direction vector a directional
light is something like the Sun the
direction to the Sun is essentially the
same for every object on earth and a
directional light is considered
infinitely far away in many modelers
such as the 3gs editor here the
directional light will be shown as some
local point that you can move around
however you're truly manipulating the
direction not the location of the light
since we often combine colors in various
ways there's not necessarily an upper
limit of 1 point 0 to a color Channel it
all depends for example if I want to
clear the screen I would want to use
values from 0 to 1 there's an upper
limit of each channels intensity so
value is larger than 1 point 0 are
beyond the monitors abilities however if
I wanted to make a light bright I might
set its intensity to 11 when the
distance from the light to the object
and the objects color are taken into
account the final color may well be
within the 0 to 1 range in some systems
you can even set the light intensity to
a negative number meaning the light is
somehow sucking photons from a surface
the lights color is just a number in an
equation after all this is true for a
materials color to that it could be set
however you want but we tend to leave
material colors between 0 and 1 thinking
of them as reflectivity these basic
illumination equations are not based on
any physical units such as wats ur
lumens but rather are set in the 0 to 1
range for our convenience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
