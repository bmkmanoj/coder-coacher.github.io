and straightforward it's a distributed
application and in the distributed
application there are threads and
channels these are the two high level
abstractions provided in the programming
model and the computation graph that you
generate using the pts programming model
in particular the abstractions thread
and channel provided by the pts
programming model the computation graph
looks very similar to a UNIX process
socket graph so in terms of a transition
for a programmer that is familiar with
the socket API to transition to
programming using the abstractions
provided by pts is not significant
while the computation graph looks
similar to a process socket graph the
semantics of the channel abstraction is
very different from the socket
abstraction in particular what the
channel holds our time sequenced data
objects so a thread is generating time
sequence data objects can place those
time sequence data objects into the
channel the other thing you would also
notice from the structure of this
computation graph that there could be
multiple producers of data that go into
a given Channel and similarly there
could be multiple consumers of data that
are getting data from a given channel or
in other words the channel allows many
too many connections a thread that
produces some data and wants to put it
into a channel uses the primitive
provided for operating on the channel
namely the put item primitive and the
put item takes two arguments one is the
item itself which is whatever the
application decides as the content of
the data that it wants to put in a
channel there is a timestamp that it can
associate with the data that it is
producing and placing in the channel so
if you look at the contents of any given
channel it's really showing a temporal
evolution of data there
being produced by a particular threat
for example this threat could be
capturing data from a camera and every
item that it produces is one frame of
image captured from the camera
associated with the wall clock time at
which that particular frame was captured
a computation that is needing to use the
data will do a get on a channel and when
it does a get on a channel it actually
has to specify two arguments one is a
lower bone for a timestamp that it is
looking for and an upper bone or in
other words a thread that wishes to get
data from this channel for instance will
specify in the get primitive that I want
to get the data that is in a particular
channel starting at a particular time
say 1:05 p.m. to an upper born one or
6:00 p.m. and what the thread is going
to get back is all the items that this
channel contains between this lower
bound and upper bound the programming
model also allows an application to
specify time variables in an abstract
way it could say I want the oldest item
from a channel or the newest item from
the channel in addition to specifying
explicit lower bound and upper bound
markers if it so chooses so in other
words a channel contains a continuous
stream of data that have been
snapshotted with different timestamps
associated with them so this is the way
one could write a program that uses the
primitives provided by the pts
programming model let's say we're
writing the code for a detector that is
looking at video stream produced by a
particular camera in that case the
detector will associate a variable
channel one with the video stream that
corresponds to what that camera is
producing
and continuously what it is gonna do is
it is gonna get a camera image from that
particular channel and it might specify
a lower bond and an upper bound in terms
of time that it is looking for process
the data produce an output and it might
place the output that it produced as a
digest of information that it processed
into another channel and it'll do that
by putting the digest as a new item and
associate a timestamp this is a place
where the programming model facilitates
temporal causality to be propagated in
the distributed system so if this thread
is a detected thread that is looking at
the camera images produced by a camera
thread then it can take the camera
images process it and place it in its
output channel and when it places it in
the output channel it can use the same
timestamp that at got for an input image
in doing the put operation and that way
there is temporal causality that has
been propagated through this graph by
the computation using the primitives
that is available from the speediest
programming system quite often in
situation awareness application the
computation may have to use data from
several different streams in order to do
its high-level inferencing so a
particular thread may get information
from several different streams and it
may have to make high-level inference
based on the composite results that it
is getting from all these streams and
since all the data that is coming from
the channels have timestamps associated
with them an intermediate computation
like this that is taking multiple
streams and generating a high level
inference from it can use the timestamps
in the incoming streams to see which
data items in these streams are
temporally correlated with one another
and use that information to improve the
kind of inferencing and hypothesis that
can be derived in the situation
awareness application so in a nutshell
the pts programming model what it allows
is the ability to associate timestamp
with data items produced by a
computation so the model allows
propagation of temporal causality
because the fact that a computation can
associate a timestamp with an item that
it produces based on the timestamp that
it got on the data that it obtained from
its input channel and thirdly the fact
that every stream is temporally indexed
allows a computation to correlate the
incoming streams and recognize which
data items in the input streams are
temporally related to one another by
looking at the timestamps associated
with the items that it is fetching from
the different channels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
