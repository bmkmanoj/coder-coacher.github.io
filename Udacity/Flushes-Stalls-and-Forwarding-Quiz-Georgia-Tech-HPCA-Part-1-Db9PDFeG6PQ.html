forwarding as a solution for hazards in
a pipeline let's do a quiz to see if you
know when it should be used let us say
that we have a five stage pipeline where
the first stage fetches the instruction
the second stage decodes the instruction
and reads the registers the third stage
the instruction does the early operation
and a branch is resolved so we know
where it's going in the mem stage loads
and stores access memory so at the end
of this stage a load will finally have a
value and finally the fifth stage writes
the result to the register here we have
some hazards first there is a control
hazard after the branch we fetch two
wrong instructions before we fetch the
correct multiply instruction in this
case so the red ones are the ones that
are fetched incorrectly the question for
you it should be flush stall or forward
here put a checkmark in each of these
three boxes depending on which one we do
here next we have a data dependence
where the multiply is producing the r-1
result and the load needs to use that as
the memory address put a check mark in
each of these three boxes depending on
whether we need to flush stall or
forward the value in this case and
finally the load is producing the value
of r1 that this add needs to use so the
question for you it should be flush
stall or forward in this case note that
in some cases more than one of these
needs to be used for optimal performance
to help you get started I'm going to
tell you that for data dependencies as
we said we never want to use flushing so
the real question is just should you
stall or forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
