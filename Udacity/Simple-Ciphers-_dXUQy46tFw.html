because each letter is mapped to another
letter by a fixed amount of shift so if
we represent letters as numbers meaning
a is 1 b is 2 and z is 26 then this
encryption scheme or cipher can be
represented as the letter meaning the
integer plus n the fixed shift amount
mod 26 here the shift amount n is a
secret or the key and obviously there
are only 26 possible keys therefore it
is easy to break Caesar cipher because
you only need to try 26 possible keys a
generalization of the scheme is to allow
arbitrary mapping of one letter to
another that is we no longer require
that a letter is meant to another letter
by always the fixed amount of shift now
of course we need to avoid that two
letters are being mapped to the same
letter the mapping meaning how each
letter is mapped to another is now the
secret key can you tell how many
possible keys are out there meaning how
many possible ways to map one letter to
another the answer is 26 factorial
because there are twenty six factorial
number ways to map one letter to another
please note that n factorial is much
larger than 2 to the N for example 26
factorial is approximately two to the 88
which is much larger than 22 26 in other
words this is a very huge number if the
attacker attempts to use brute force or
the sprightly search all the possible
keys is going to take a long time
because there are two to the 88th number
of possible keys so what's to the
attacker do instead instead of trying
all possible keys an attacker can
analyze the statistical frequencies of
letters to break the schemes for example
in English the most frequently used
letter is e and if in the ciphertext the
letter X is the most frequent then
there's a high probability then e is
mapped to X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
