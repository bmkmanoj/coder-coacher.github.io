have found out is 5 but there are
actually two different ways that you can
solve this problem let's go through both
of them so if you remember our order of
operations acronym pemdas this tells us
that before we do any subtraction which
will have to do right here we need to
deal with whatever is happening inside
parentheses so if we are following this
set of rules we would say that this is
equal to 10 minus dealing with what's
inside the parentheses 2 plus 3 is 5 and
then we would do the subtraction 10-5 is
5 however as we saw in dealing with the
equation that we gave to grant there's a
way to get rid of parentheses so that we
can solve this problem in a different
way let's pretend that the numbers that
we have up here actually refer to some
objects let's say these circles that
I've have down here right now so here
are 10 circles and I want to figure out
how to modify this group of circles in
accordance with this expression so we
have 10 at first and then we want to get
rid of two plus three of them so if we
did the problem the original way or we
have 10 minus five circles then we would
just count out five of these one two
three four five select just those ones
and then get rid of them and then in the
end we're left with one two three four
five five circles however let's talk
about how to do the problem in the other
way instead of grouping the circles that
we want to get rid of as one whole group
as we did in the first way so that's by
dealing with what's inside the
parentheses first and circling all five
of the circles we want to get rid of
let's think about these as two separate
groups so know that we want to get rid
of two circles that's just these two and
we also want to get rid of three circles
now instead of merging these into one
group like we did the first way why
don't we just get rid of each of them
separately since we know that we need to
get rid of this whole thing so first
we'll get rid of these two and then
we'll get rid of these three as well and
in the end we're left the same five
circles that we were when we did the
problem the first way so we really did
was subtract two circles so it 10-2
circles and then we set out to the three
so this gave us our final five circles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
