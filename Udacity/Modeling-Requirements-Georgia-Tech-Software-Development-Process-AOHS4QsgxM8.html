on the requirements for the system that
we have developing we need to model it
in a structured and clear way so that it
can be analyzed every find and there are
really tons of ways to do that depending
on your focus and objectives more
specifically when modeling requirements
you need to decide what you want to
model and how you want to model it so
let's look at these two aspects
independently what you decide to model
depends on where your emphasis is that
is on which aspects of the requirements
you want to focus for example if your
emphasis is on the characteristics of
the enterprise of the company that
you're analyzing you may want to model
goals and objectives of the company or
its organizational structure its tasks
and dependencies and so on conversely if
your focus is on information and
behaviors you may want to concentrate on
aspects such as the structure of the
information various behavioral views
some of which we will see in the next
lesson or maybe time or sequencing
requirements finally if you're mostly
interested in the quality aspects of
your system you will focus on the
various non-functional properties of the
software that are relevant in the
context consider for example reliability
robustness security and so on you will
just pick the ones that are relevant for
your context and as we said there's a
second dimension after you have decided
what to model in your system you have to
decide how you want to model it so I
want to show here some options for
modeling enterprises information and
quality aspects and as you can see here
for each type of information there are
many possible models that we can use to
represent it and all these models have
advantages and disadvantages different
levels of formality and different focus
something else that I want to point out
about these models is the fact that
these models are often orthogonal to one
another especially if we consider models
in different categories so what that
means is that they're complementary
rather than mutually exclusive different
models can be used to provide views of
the requirements from different
perspective and we will not see most of
these models in this course but I wanted
to list them anyways to give you an idea
of how many there are and how vast is
this area as far as we're concerned in
the course and for the projects we will
express requirements using
of two main ways using natural language
that is in formal specifications and
using UML diagrams which is graphical
models and we will introduce UML and the
most important diagrams in the next
lesson and the only other type of models
that I want to mention explicitly our
goal models because they are extremely
popular so the main idea with goal
models is to start with the main goal of
the system and then keep refining it by
decomposing it in sub goals so it's kind
of a very natural way of progressing and
you continue this refinement until you
get to goals that can be operationalized
and represent the basic units of
functionality of the system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
