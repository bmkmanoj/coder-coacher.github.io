images from the internet onto the screen
in your app well there's a networking
part to actually download the images
can't do down the main thread so we'll
have to use a background thread you
probably want to cache the images
locally to prevent unnecessary repeated
downloading oh and down sampling and
decoding doesn't make sense to load
giant images just to display tiny icons
well and we have icons in our list so
we'll probably want some behavior to
ensure that we can still scroll our list
nice and smoothly all whole bunch of
images are loaded or cancel requests for
images that are no longer visible due to
life cycle changes such as our activity
being paused then we can add the image
to the screen at least we have image
view there oh and we have our
notification as well there we probably
do need to get the whole image as we
build the notification so maybe a
synchronous API for this case anyone
else thinking this is a bit complicated
I can't just cut out any of these steps
if we want a good experience but none of
the logic here is unique to sunshine
right plenty of other apps have gone
through the same flow and tackle these
same steps when you see these types of
reusable pieces of code it's a great
time to consider using a library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
