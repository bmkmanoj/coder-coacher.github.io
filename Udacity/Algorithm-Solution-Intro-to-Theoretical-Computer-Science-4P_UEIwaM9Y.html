at least I think it's very surprising
this algorithm is capable of finding any
combination of program and input that
halts and the reason is simple if a
program halts then the program has a
finite length the input has a finite
length and the number of steps in which
the program can run on the input if it
halts is finite and at a certain point
in time since this loop here is infinite
max length will be larger than any of
those three constraints and once max
length has become large enough we will
find that P terminates on the input
after a certain number of steps and so
we will print it the only reason why the
algorithm could not find a certain
combination of program and input is that
the program does not halt on that input
the first one amazingly means that the
algorithm is indeed correct of course it
is totally infeasible and practice as
well because if you think about it a
program is a text string now even for
very very very small values of max
length the number of these text strings
for the program and of course also the
number of text strings for this input
here becomes exponentially huge so it's
a purely theoretical construct but it
explains why at least in some
theoretical computer science courses you
will hear that the halting problem is
referred to as recursively enumerable so
the algorithm is totally impractical but
it is nevertheless correct and that is
the reason why the combination of
programs and inputs for which the
program halts on the input is called
recursively enumerable at least in some
theoretical computer science courses now
this one is interesting can this
algorithm be modified to output any
programs that don't halt and the answer
is of course no because this technique
here clearly only works when the program
stops as long as the program goes on we
cannot make any statement about it we
cannot say if the program will still
continue running if it will stop at a
certain point in time and that is the
reason why we can't modify this
algorithm so that it finds combinations
of programs at input that don't halt
this of course also tells you again why
the problem is semi decidable because we
can find those combinations here but we
cannot find those over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
