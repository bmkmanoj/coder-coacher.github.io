client needs to validate that signature
to do that it needs to know the
corresponding public key it needs to
know that public key that can be used to
decrypt this message and if it decrypts
it it can check that this hash value is
the same as what it computes when it
hashes the certificate content itself so
that's the real problem that public key
infrastructure needs to solve we need
ways of distributing these public keys
and that's called public key
infrastructure also known as pki we need
a way to securely know the public key of
the issuer once we know that well we can
use the certificate to learn the public
key of the website we visited so how do
we know that public key so let's look
back at the certificate that we got from
google and what we see at the top of it
is the certificate hierarchy we see that
we have the google com certificate and
that's the one that we looked at and saw
that it had this public key and that was
signed by an issuer and that issuers
sweat and we can click on that and now
we can see the certificate from thought
that was used to sign the certificate so
we have the certificate from twat it was
issued by verisign we can check that
it's valid it's valid to 2014 and that
certificate also has a public key so
it's got a subject identifying
throughout consulting that generated the
key and it's got a public key it's also
an RSA key with PK CS and we can see
that public key so that's the public key
that we can use to validate the
certificate that RSA provided we can use
that to decrypt the sign hash to
validate that certificate this would
only be useful if we knew that we could
trust this public key so how do we trust
this public key well it's got a
certificate and its certificate was
issued by verisign we can find very
signs public key to verify this one so
that's the top of the certificate
hierarchy here that we have a
certificate from verisign and if we look
at that one well it came from verisign
and it's got a public key also an RSA
key and this one you'll notice all of
them use 60 5537
as their exponent the modulus asst are
different if they weren't different that
would mean they're all using the same
public key which would be a pretty
serious problem and if we look at this
key we can see it's expiration date is
all the way up to 20 28 it goes back to
nineteen ninety-six so this is a very
long-lived key and this is the key that
is the root of our certificate hierarchy
so here's what we have we have a
certificate that was sent by google it
was signed using a private key owned by
thuat consulting so to validate that we
need the corresponding public key which
we get from a certificate that was
signed by verisign to verify that we
need the public key for verisign and we
have that from a certificate which says
it's Vera signs so how can we trust
verisign certificate or do we have to
keep going on forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
