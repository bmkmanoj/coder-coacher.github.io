learned well first we learn about
similar triangles to triangles are
similar if their angles are identical
even though their sides don't have to be
the same length and we learn that these
triangles have many special properties
one really important property is that
the ratio of side lengths are the same
for two similar triangles what this
means is that if I have a right triangle
with a 40 degree angle here I can
immediately tell you the ratio of this
side to that side or this one to that
one and that's a very powerful tool in
fact those ratios are so powerful that
we gave names to them sine cosine and
tangent and we can remember what those
names mean by so kah TOA sine is
opposite over hypotenuse cosine adjacent
over hypotenuse and tangent opposite
over adjacent finally we learned that we
can go back and forth between sides and
angles side lengths and angles measured
in degrees and this is something that
we'll be doing frequently throughout the
course let me say good work this is a
huge accomplishment learning this much
already now let's put it to use and
figure out what the circumference of the
earth is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
