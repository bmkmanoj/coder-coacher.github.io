features for free so is it doing
anything automatically to protect our
data not anything automatically that I
know of but why don't you check it out
yeah check it out okay well how about
the security and rules tab of the
dashboard hmm well this seems pretty
unsecured that's a little bit troubling
why do you say that what about all that
permission and login flow stuff you
talked about when designing version
point three that was client-side
security so here we have the firebase
server and the client site app anyone
using the shopping list plus plus
android app would get any of the
security and provisioning that i built
into the app itself things like needing
to be logged in before seeing any data
in the app we're needing to be the owner
of the shopping list before seeing the
share icon to share your shopping list
with friends but again this is all
client-side logic that the server
there's nothing about by default the
server itself is wide open allowing our
data to be written by anyone or anything
now if all communication is done via the
Android apps things are okay but saying
hopefully the near future we make a Iong
is and as a team what we probably do is
try to implement the same security
features in the Android app in both of
these other apps now I'm not an iOS
programmer or a web app programmer so I
just kind of have to hope that who is
ever making these two apps knows what
they're doing let's say that the iOS
girl knows what she's doing but who ever
read the web app was a little sloppy and
introduced some security bugs so even
though these clients were implemented
correctly one client being implemented
incorrectly jeopardizes the entire
database this is where you might be
wishing that there was just one place
where you could enforce what can and
can't be done with the data because
otherwise again we're relying on every
single client to implement security
perfectly and in the same way right and
that's the purpose of server-side rules
namely those firebase security rules
I've been hounding you about alright
alright GP you're right we should do
something about security come to think
of it geez what well I just realized
there's an even bigger security flaw
than just writing a web app with a bug
in it remember when we first wrote our
Android app I didn't have to do anything
to verify that the app was owned by the
same person that owed the firebase so
going back to my data here is a jsfiddle
and it's just some arbitrary JavaScript
here
basically I just copied this from the
Quick Start Guide for writing JavaScript
for firebase and if I run this it
actually affects my firebase over here
and this could have been run by anybody
I mean there was nothing that required
me to verify where this code was coming
from so it looks like basically anywhere
anyone in the world can write read data
to our database okay JP it looks like we
kind of are open to security threats so
why don't you tell me what we can do
with firebase security rules you got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
