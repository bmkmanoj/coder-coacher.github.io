open a browser go to the public host
near the ombari server on port 8080 you
can see mine here if you can't connect
check the security roles for the embargo
server make sure the port 8080 is open
login with username admin and password
admin it's pretty clear where you should
do here launch install wizard named a
cluster next select the stack this
determines the software version is
installed on the cluster choose the
newest one hdb 2.3 this stands for
hurtin works data platform here you list
the host names of the computers in the
cluster remember the internal host names
I had you copy copy those into here
upload your SSH private key and change
the user account to ubuntu okay hit
register and confirm everything should
install and register just fine you
should see a big list of services that
you can install on the cluster for now
just do HDFS yarn zookeeper and ombari
metrics now you can choose the host that
the various services run on bari has
reasonable suggestions but you can see
here that there's one service per
computer instead let's move the metrics
collector to this computer so it runs
with the zookeeper server so this is 17
23 1 15 30 a metrics collector so we'll
just put it there then hit next now you
need to assign data nodes and clients
node manager here worked with yarn to
keep track of the data node resources
client installs all these clients on
machines since these hosts are running
master components make these three data
nodes with node managers and next you
shouldn't need to customize any services
right now but look around to see which
options you can change okay and ignore
this okay finally you can deploy it this
might take a few minutes so take a break
by visiting your favorite website right
there we go everything is running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
