anytime you see this pen you are
actually watching a video that's taking
place right here anyway back to the
subject at hand unfortunately we can't
teach you everything there is to know
about the world of web development at
some point you'll be on your own and
you'll need to learn some new technique
or technology so instead of focusing
directly on teaching you everything that
you could ever know we want to make sure
that you're ready to be independent we
want you to be able to figure out new
techniques and technologies on your own
and thrive in whatever the web dev world
becomes so to start all of that off I
want to go back to the very beginning
some of you may recognize this this is
Netscape Navigator and it was the first
major web browser it was released in
1994 and it was based on the earlier
mosaic browser which was developed by
the University of Illinois back in 1993
of course
navigator peaked in popularity in the
90s and eventually Microsoft's Internet
Explorer came to dominate the web
browser landscape development on
navigator stopped but you can still
trace features in code in older versions
of Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox
all the way back to Netscape Navigator
in fact Netscape Navigator looks pretty
similar to the browsers that we still
have today there's a URL bar at the top
and then a big viewport to consume
content nowadays web developers use
three different languages to develop
websites HTML which stands for hypertext
markup language CSS which stands for
cascading style sheets and JavaScript
which well I guess just stands for
JavaScript in a nutshell
HTML describes the content and structure
of a website CSS describes the styling
of a website and javascript handles all
the interactions you'll be learning all
about these three languages in the
lessons to come however this situation
with HTML CSS and Java
script hasn't always been the case the
early web was almost entirely all text
documents with maybe a couple images
kind of like newspapers as a result the
first browsers only supported HTML CSS
and JavaScript didn't exist yet believe
it or not this is the first website the
web wasn't originally designed for big
applications like Facebook and Gmail it
was developed as a way for text
documents to directly link to one
another you can see all the links on
this page the links were meant to mimic
references that you would find in
bibliographies or annotations in
research papers in fact the academic
route should be pretty obvious because
this website is from CERN which is the
Nuclear Institute in Europe at the time
these links were really nothing more
than ways of referencing other people's
work check it out this was the first
Microsoft homepage over time developers
started adding styles to their content
changing colors and fonts and
backgrounds and a little bit of layout
all of these changes ended up in the
HTML and the code was a huge mess now
you're looking at the Yahoo homepage
around the year 2000 this image is
actually courtesy of the Internet
Archive Wayback Machine which is a kind
of hilarious way to check out older
websites if you want to see how the web
used to look anyway CSS came on the
scene around 1996 as developers really
wanted to add more and more and more
styles to their pages with CSS
developers could then separate these
styles like deciding how all of this
will look from the content which is
essentially all of the text on this page
of course that's just HTML and CSS then
there is JavaScript JavaScript is a
different beast altogether while HTML
and CSS are markup languages and that is
to say they're only used to describe
other documents javascript is a full-on
programming language it allows
developers to change the content and the
style
of a live web site javascript has had an
interesting history it was developed in
1995 by a guy named Brendan Eich and he
did it in ten days that is crazy
you may not know much about programming
now or maybe you do but either way that
is an impressive feat he created
JavaScript to run in Netscape Navigator
today JavaScript runs in every browser
and is one of the most popular
programming languages period thanks to
the popularity of the web javascript
runs in a huge number of environments
outside of browsers including servers
with software like nodejs and
microcontrollers like Tesla oh all right
and speaking of popularity it's easy to
assume that javascript is an offshoot of
the programming language Java because of
their similar names Java was hugely
popular in 1995 and in fact it still is
today as it turns out though Java and
JavaScript are in no way related I mean
there are a couple of syntax
similarities but that doesn't change the
fact that the name JavaScript was
basically just a marketing decision to
piggyback on Java's popularity true
