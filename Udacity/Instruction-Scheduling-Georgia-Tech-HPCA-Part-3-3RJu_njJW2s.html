scheduling in the compiler note that
this is different from what happens in a
Tomasulo type scheduler where the
hardware is trying to reorder
instructions in a different way than
they were arranged by the compiler now
the compiler will actually try to do a
similar thing here's a sequence of
instructions that can happen we load a
value from the address in r1 into r2 we
add r0 to that we store the result back
into that memory location we next move
the memory address four places forward
so that we are looking at the next for
example element in an array in memory
and then we compare the pointer to some
sort of end of array pointer and if they
are not equal we jump back to the loop
so these are five instructions out of
which a single iteration of a loop is
composed of let's say that we have a
very simple processor that can only look
at the very next instructions so it's
not really trying to have reservation
stations and execute out of order
in that case what might happen is there
would be this load and let's say it
takes two cycles to actually get the
value into this register from the cache
that means that the next cycle the
processor cannot do this ad it has to
stall because the result in r2 is not
available yet in the next cycle it will
be adding r0 to the value in r2 let's
say now that the add takes a few cycles
let's say three so only here can restore
the next instruction doesn't depend on
the store so let's say we can do it in
the next cycle but then this add again
takes three cycle let's say so we have
two stalls before we can do this branch
so let's say that the compiler is trying
to help the processor do better than
this if we still have the same processor
but we want it to execute these
instructions faster than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 cycles per iteration how can we do
that well what the compiler will try to
do is it knows that after this load we
cannot do this ad until 2 cycles later
so it's going to try to find something
that can be here so we need something
that doesn't depend on the load and can
be done here now we can see that the ad
does depend on the load so it cannot go
here the store needs the result of the
ad so it cannot move here
but the ad actually can go here because
the ad doesn't depend on the r-1 value
here so the compiler is going to try to
move this ad I here so we want a
schedule in which the ad is here because
this processor can do only one
instruction at a time in the order in
which they're listed in the program that
would mean moving this ad here in the
program let's see how that would be done
so conceptually we want this ad here
note however that while the load gets
the same value of r1 that he did before
the store now gets r1 that has already
been incremented by four so we have
moved this ad because this R one is now
larger than it should be we have to fix
the offset here so that it loads from r1
minus four when we remove this ad the
branch still C is the correct value of
r1 because it needs to see the
incremented value and the new problem
looks like this the black stuff is the
stuff that has moved or changed and the
blue stuff is what has remained exactly
the same as before now let's see what
happens to our schedule now we have a
load and instead of the ad here being
the next instruction so we had to stall
the next instruction is this ad this ad
can proceed in parallel with the load it
doesn't depend on the r2 so we can
actually do this ad here so instead of a
stall we can now do our ad I this
eliminates one of the stalls the ad here
doesn't depend on this side so it can
still stay where it is now in order to
get to the store instruction we still
have to do the two stalls because the ad
here takes two cycles of stalling before
we can use the result so this store
needs to stay here but at this point we
have already done this ad I it's moved
here of course the store now needs to be
modified this way so this instruction is
now like this the ad now goes away so we
have just removed one cycle here next
when can we do this branch well the ad
has happened here we cannot use our one
until one to the third cycle from there
so pretty much at any point after here
the branch actually safe to go as far as
r1 is
CERN note that here we had to stall
because of this so we have just
eliminated two more cycles here and now
we can do our branch
so pretty much we had plenty of stalls
then now we have only two stalls and the
rest of the loop body is scheduled so
pretty much the idea of instruction
scheduling is to find instructions that
can be done in place of stalls and thus
avoid having too many stalls in the
processor schedule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
