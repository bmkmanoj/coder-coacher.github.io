actually use them now just like
exponents have a base so do logs if for
example like in this function we have
here our exponent has a base of 2 then
so does the log that is its inverse
let's plug a number in and try something
out we know that for this function f of
3 is equal to 2 to the third or just ate
using logs this means that log base 2 of
8 equals 3 I know this is all very new
so if this sounds confusing or
unfamiliar that's not a big deal at all
don't worry we will keep working with
these and you'll come to understand them
very well in a short period of time now
we can see more clearly what's going on
here if we rewrite this eight we can
instead put 2 to the third there and
this shows what's really happening we
know that log base 2 is the inverse of
what's happening here and we can see
here that it really is undoing what
happened to the original three that
input with the function f we input 3 and
it out put eight and we input that
number at the output into the log
function in other words when we took log
base 2 of 8 the output was the original
input this inverse function this log
function undid to the three what F did
to it in the first place let's look at
this in a different way when we input
three into our exponential function it
spits out 2 to the third then when we
use two to the third as the input for
the logarithmic function that's the
inverse of the exponential one the
output is three again similarly if we
use three as the input for a logarithmic
function the exponential function undoes
what the log does in other words 2 to
the power of log base two of 3 is equal
to 3 this is just confirming that these
two inverse functions behave just like
other inverse functions F of F inverse
of X gives us X and F inverse of f of X
gives us X so here's a couple for you to
try on your own what is log base 2 of 16
and what is log base 2 of 64 giving you
a little hint for how to think about
these try to rewrite 16 as 2 to some
power what power belongs here and then
how does that affect what number goes
over here maybe you can think about
one in the same way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
