champion cybersecurity and get the
company to a proactive cyber security
posture how do you make your case your
champion it's your job to be as well
prepared as possible given the cost
benefits and risk tolerance and so on
what are the kind of arguments you can
make the easiest argument to make is the
bottom line argument or the economic
argument that it's going to save us
money of course security doesn't make
money security we say it's a cost it
doesn't bring money in but we could lose
money because of that the economic
argument we can make is the return on
investment argument or the ROI argument
saying if we don't you know do this
we're going to lose 10 million dollars
if we do this it's only going to be
cautious 1 million and we save 5 million
because the losses we're going to suffer
we long be reduced by half then of
course it's an investment you making you
you're putting out 1 million but you
save in five million so that is a pretty
good return on on the investment that we
have so the economic argument of course
makes sense when you say that by coming
up with a budget to put a control in
place the costs that we're going to have
is going to result in savings that are
much greater than the cost significant
savings greater than the cost so there
is in a way a return on the investment
this is money we're going to lose that
we're not going to lose now and that's
how our bottom line is going to be in a
better state course this does require
that you estimate the cost benefits that
we're talking about and unfortunately
it's pretty tricky costs and benefits
either you can exactly quantify them so
that would be data driven or its
perception so but perception is sort of
what they perceive to be the risk and
you know what they perceive the risk
reduction maybe if we do a or b or
something like that versus sort of
actually knowing those probabilities and
those impact numbers that we are talking
about so you're going to make an
argument you know this is all fine and
good but lot of times it comes to
perception and then people would say
about this is their opinion how do you
know for sure do you have some hard
numbers and unfortunately making the
argument is difficult because a lot of
times those hard numbers are not easy to
come by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
