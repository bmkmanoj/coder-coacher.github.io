to figure out what the dependencies are
among them well first and most obviously
nothing is going to succeed no file
system call is going to succeed until
we've mounted the file system similarly
no file system call will succeed after
we've unmounted it so we want to be
careful with mountain and unmount we
don't want to just freely mix those into
our stream of random API calls that
we're making because if we do that we're
gonna be mounting and unmounting the
things so often that the file system
code is never gonna get into the kind of
steady state that we're gonna need it to
be in in order to do effective random
testing of it so similarly some of the
other calls in the file system like
reading and writing to a file are only
gonna succeed if the files been opened
and so if we do something silly like
providing completely random arguments to
open read and write then the odds of us
actually successfully reading or writing
to an open file are gonna be extremely
low we're gonna have to do something
more system at we're probably gonna have
to do something like open a file and
keep track of the fact that it's open so
we can randomly generate read and write
calls into it they're probably some
other dependencies as well and so what
we're seeing is that if we want to do a
fective random testing of a file system
we're going to need to track these
dependencies at least in some
rudimentary fashion in order to issue a
sequence of API calls that's going to do
reasonably effective random testing of
the file system the second issue that
starts to come up as we perform random
testing of api's is that our tests that
is to say a sequence of file system
operations in this example are gonna
become quite large and that's going to
beg the question how are those tests
represented so in the examples we've
seen so far test cases haven't had any
sort of official existence of their own
what they've learnt what we've rather
done is mix the software under test and
the test driver code in a single piece
of Python code so now if we do this
what's the actual form taken by the test
cases and the answer has to be that
those test cases only exist as ephemeral
objects in memory for most testing
purposes that's fine the driver code
creates the test cases passes them to
the software under test looks at the
results and keeps going until it
finishes now there are a couple cases in
which that's not so good one of them is
where we find a particular test case
that makes our system fail and we'd like
to save off that test case for later use
in regression testing and so we end up
having to do to make that work is
writing some separate code which also
lives in the Python program to load and
save test cases and so now this module
who's gonna go is gonna be doing file
you know in order to load and save test
cases and most likely those test cases
are gonna be saved as text files or
something so for example if we wanted to
represent a sequence of file system
calls as a text file we could just have
the word mcdeere followed by whatever
the arguments to make deer are and then
the loading and saving
we need to either parse those files in
order to create a test case in memory or
unpark them that it's a pretty print
them to disk in order to save a test
case so there's a couple advantages of
doing this and first of all I was always
saying it facilitates regression testing
and the second reason is that it's often
the case that when random tests become
extremely large we need to turn them
into first-class objects that is to say
objects living on disk using some sort
of a save and load routine in order to
perform test case reduction test case
reduction is a piece of technology
that's very often combined with random
testing and what it is and what it does
is takes a large test case that makes
the software under test fail and turns
it into a smaller test case that still
makes the software under test fail and
we'll look at more detail when we look
at test case reduction in more detail
later on in this course so now what I'd
like to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
