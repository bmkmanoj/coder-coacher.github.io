able to compute some probabilities from
this Joint Distribution so let's see
what happens when we start talking about
more variables more propositions that
could be true or false what I did is I
filled in Thunder as another variable
and thunder can be true or false in each
of these cases and I wrote down what the
probabilities could be for my experience
in Atlanta in the summer I was I was
around over last summer and in 2004 so
let's so I'm an expert obviously so I'm
so I'm able to estimate these
probabilities to the nearest percent
anyway the point is that one of the
things you should notice here is that
each time we add one variable what
happens to the number of probabilities
that we have to write down well in a
world where it's binary it goes up by
two a factor of two right not just two
more but like twice as many and so if we
have a complicated scenario that we want
to be able to reason about and it's got
I don't know a hundred variables that's
gonna be a lot that's good I can't even
yeah it's technically a real number but
it's it's a it's an unimaginably large
number there's only like four numbers
one two three mini and too many so it's
gonna be really inconvenient as we start
adding more of these and especially if
we add variables like you know remember
the restaurant example that we worked on
we were doing decision trees oh yeah
those are the days then there was some
variables like food type and what was
the deal with food type it had lots of
values yeah yeah like five or something
like that time American and Italian
right and so if we have at a variable
like that it's going to multiply the
number of probabilities that we need by
five so this is gonna get really big
really fast so wouldn't it be nice if we
had a more convenient way of writing
around this distribution yeah that would
be nice so it turns out that we can
factor it but I thought we already had a
factor of two well that was a joke but
it actually is pretty close to being the
truth which is the idea that instead of
representing also so in this case
there's eight numbers instead of
representing them as eight numbers we're
gonna represent it by you know two times
two times two so we really are going to
essentially factor it putting putting
things into pieces that we can recombine
smaller piece that we can become
into into larger pieces and it yeah it
turns out that actually works out really
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
