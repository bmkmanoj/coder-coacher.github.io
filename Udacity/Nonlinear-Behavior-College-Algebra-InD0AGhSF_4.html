values of x the amount were increasing
each dimension x and a the total area of
grants display space or at least the
ones that we've seen so far the original
area before we added anything to either
dimension was 150 square feet when we
added one foot in each direction the
area changed 176 square feet so in the
transition from this point to this point
x 1 up by one and A one up by 26 let's
see what happens in the next transition
once again x 1 up by one but this time a
increased by 28 instead of 26 this is
what we call nonlinear behavior remember
that for a straight line which you can
write as y equals MX plus B and the
slope is going to be the same regardless
of which points we pick the change in X
is always going to be the same the
change in x value is always going to
have the same proportion to change in Y
value the change between two x values
and the change between two Y values it's
always going to obey the same ratio that
is not what's happening here this
equation no longer applies a change of
one foot and dimension doesn't always
increase the area by the same amount
this is a pretty interesting problem to
have remembering that area is equal to
length times width can you come up with
an equation that we can use to figure
out what value of x will give us an area
of 300 square feet so they go out how X
will be involved in both the length and
width of this new area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
