3x minus 2 times the quantity X plus 1
is greater than or equal to negative 5
find the solution set for X this is
another compound inequality this time
the inequalities are joined by and when
a compound inequality has an and that
means the solution set only contains
numbers that satisfy both inequalities
there are more requirements of the
solution set so this is the less
inclusive of the two kinds of compound
inequalities or is the more inclusive so
skipping a few steps this simplifies to
X is less than 2 and this one simplifies
to X is greater than or equal to
negative 3 since these are joined by an
and statement we need to find the set of
numbers that is true for both X is less
than 2 and X is greater than or equal to
negative 3 on our number line we can
show x is less than 2 like this x is
greater than negative 3 will look like
this the solution set here is everywhere
that the two graphs overlap so here to
here the part of the number line that I
just circled is everywhere where x is
less than 2 and X is greater than or
equal to negative 3 this solution set
can also be written like this which
reads negative 3 is less than or equal
to x which is less than to make sure all
of this is in your notebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
