what we mean by tracking here's some saw
the older ones the one on the left here
this girl jumping around you see a
little red ring around her head that's I
think that's Andrew Blake's daughter a
long time ago I think she's now a lawyer
so it tells you something about the time
difference Andrew I had no idea if
that's true and also from the similar
work is this leaf blowing in the wind
and you'll notice as the camera zooms in
and out and things move around it does a
pretty good job of sticking to the leaf
both of these examples were work that
Andrew and Michael eyes are did in the
particular type of tracking that will
actually do not this lecture about a
couple lessons from now here's a
slightly more recent one this is a
tracking of body parts as somebody's
moving you can see the the reference
there and again this is a tracking
problem but it's tracking with a model
right so the idea is I want to be able
to track where the parts have moved here
you see a sort of a more traditional
notion of tracking but in this case it's
lots of targets right so there are a lot
of people say walking around in the
street here and you'll notice that it
does a really good job of keeping track
of all the people the little box that's
around each one of them and is another
little box that's on their head here
there's a just a little bit of an
animation showing you that it's tracking
them through space-time right so this
volume with these trajectories through
there showing you how it's doing the
reasoning over space time there are a
couple of interesting things to notice
here watch this guy going behind the
pole alright so he goes behind the pole
and he appears the other side and you
might ask how does it do that how does
it do that I'm not gonna tell you yet
I'll tell you soon and also here it's
showing you just the heads that have
been tracked to show you that it's
recover that so this is an example of
sort of a state-of-the-art tracking at
least of a couple of years ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
