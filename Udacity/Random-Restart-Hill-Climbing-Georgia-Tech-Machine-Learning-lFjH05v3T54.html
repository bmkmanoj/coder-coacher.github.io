to give us a way to deal with the fact
that hill climbing can get stuck and the
place where it gets stuck might not
actually be the best place to be and so
we can go back to that function that we
looked at before so what are some places
that this could get stuck there there
and there and and others to boot
so what randomize hill climb is going to
do is once a local optimum is reached
the whole we're just going to start the
whole thing again from some other
randomly chosen X it's like you know
sort of what you do if you were trying
to solve a problem and you got stuck
you're like okay let me just try to
solve it again so why is this a good
idea well one it it takes away the luck
factor of I happen to pick a good
starting place although I suppose it
replaces it with the luck factor that I
randomly happened to pick a good place
but that's okay because I'm going to
keep randomly picking good places for
randomly picking starting places yeah so
you get multiple tries to find a good
starting place that there could be
various places where you start that
don't do so well but as long as there's
places where you do well then you might
luck into two starting in one of those
places and and climb up to the tippy top
and win another advantage is that it's
actually not much more expensive so
whatever the cost is of climbing up a
hill all you've done is multiplied it by
you know a factor a constant factor
which is how many times you're willing
to do a random restart yeah that's a
good way thinking about it that it's
it's really just random hill climbing
repeated however many times do you feel
like you have time to repeat it and it
can actually do much much better now if
there really is only one local sorry if
there is only one global optimum and
there's no local optimum then what's
going to happen when we do random
restart hill climbing will just keep
getting the same answer yeah over and
over again so it could be that we that
we might keep track of that and notice
okay you know what we seem to be in a
space where these random restarts aren't
getting us any new information so we
might as well stop now well that's one
answer but I could think of another
answer what's that so maybe you just
keep starting too close to the same
place you're starting before I mean it
may be random but you can get unlucky
and random right so maybe you should
make certain your next random point as
far away from where you started so that
you cover the space you want to cover
the space as best you can
yeah the randomness should do that at
least on average but you're right so we
could try to be more systematic so here
might be an example of a kind of
function where that'd be really rel
so imagine we've got here's our input
space and most of the random points that
we choose are all going to lead us to
the top of this hill but a very small
percentage are actually going to lead us
to the top of the the real hill the the
top that we really want the optimum so
yeah we might not want to give up after
a relatively small number of tries
because it could be that there's just
this tiny little I know I'm gonna call
it a basin of Attraction mm-hmm I like
them and if it's small enough which
might take lots of tries to hit it in
fact it could be a needle in a haystack
in which case there's only one place
that you could start that has that
optimum and that could take a very very
long time to look into in fact the hill
calming part isn't doing anything for
you at that point yeah but you know if
you're in a world where there's only one
point that's maximum and there's only
one way to get to it but happen to land
on a single point then you're in a bad
world anyway wait I mean there's nothing
nothing is going to work out nothing's
going to help you in that world yeah
right and in fact I would I would claim
since everything has some kind of
inductive bias right here you're making
some assumption about like local
smoothness or something that makes sense
here because if you're if you are
worried about a world where there is
always some point of the infinite number
of points you could be looking at say
that is the right one and there's no way
of finding it other than having to
stumbled on it from the beginning then
you can't make any assumptions about
anything you mowzer just look at every
single point and what's the point of
that fair enough so the assumption here
I guess is that there you can make local
improvements and that local improvements
add up to global improvements right hey
I got a question I got a semantic
question for a definition question for
you sure you decided that you didn't if
you only have one optimum you didn't
want to call it a local optimum so is a
local optimum by definition not a global
optimum so if I was being mathematical
about it I would define local optimum in
a way that would include the global
optimum but it's just awkward to talk
about it that way because it feels like
a local optimum is someplace you don't
want to be and the global optimum is
someplace you do want to be but yeah
that's right the global optimum is a
local optimum in the sense that you
can't improve it using local steps okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
