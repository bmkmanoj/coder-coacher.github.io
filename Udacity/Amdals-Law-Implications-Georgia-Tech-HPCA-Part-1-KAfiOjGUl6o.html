what it implies for our improvements so
our Randall's law says that speed-up is
equal to 1 over 1 minus fraction
enhanced this is the part of the program
that we didn't enhanced and it just
figures here plus the fraction that we
did enhance and that fraction became so
much faster because of the speed-up on
that part so now let's compare two
possible enhancements this is the first
enhancement this will be the second
enhancement the first enhancement is
giving us a speed-up of 20 which is an
extremely large speed-up on 10% of
execution time enhancement tool is
giving us a speed-up of 1.6 on 80% of
execution time using undos law we can
now compute what is the overall speed-up
resulting from these enhancements here
we have 1 over unaffected is 90 percent
of execution time affected is 0.1 and
it's shorter by 20 times you can compute
this and get one point one zero five
here we get one over the unenhanced
fraction is zero point two the enhanced
fraction is 0.8 and we speed that up by
the one point six factor and we get 1
point 43 as you can see it is usually
better to have a smaller speed-up on
most of your execution time then a huge
speed-up on a very small part of it in
fact even if we had an infinite speed up
on this 10% of execution time we would
get 1 over
unenhanced is 0.9 enhanced 0.1 divided
by infinity so it becomes zero and we
still get one point 1 1 1 now it is very
very difficult to get huge speed ups
like this on anything and it's of course
impossible to get infinite speed ups so
what this means is that if you put
significant effort to speed up something
that is a small part of the execution
time
we'll still not get a very large overall
improvement in contrast if you are
affecting a large part of execution time
then even a reasonably small speed-up
will still result in a similar speed-up
overall so the overall conclusion from
this is that Amdahl's law tells us to
make the common case fast
whatever spends the most of our
execution time is what should we be
trying to speed up and we should not
focus too much on stuff that consumes
very little of our execution time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
