little formula from topology called the
euler-poincare a formula for connected
planar graphs V is the number of
vertices F is the number of faces he is
the number of edges and G is the genus
the genus is the number of holes in the
object as an example a sphere and a cube
have genus 0 a doughnut and a coffee cup
with a handle have genus 1 there's an
old joke about topologists not being
able to tell their coffee cup from their
doughnut and edge collapse is a
reversible process so let's show how it
effects the formula first we know we're
going to have a vertex created so that's
one we can see that as the point moves
up two faces are created so that's two
faces we can also see three edges are
created the genus doesn't change there
are no holes created or destroyed we can
see this sums up to zero the Delta in
other words this formula applies to this
mesh and this mesh and they both must
come out to be the answer to so the
Delta must be zero the difference
between them so this equation says we
subtracted a vertex in two faces to
balance the equation three edges must
also be removed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
