exception handling problems remember
there are two of those problems one of
the problems occurs because this divide
can be delayed and realized that r2 is
zero much much later while the add for
example can be quick and be done
so if you remember with tomasulo's
algorithm the add would deposit the
result to the destination register of
the add long before the divide had a
chance to determine that r2 is zero and
that really we should have jumped to the
exception handler here and never
executed the add so how does the Rob
help well what we do is we treat the
exception just like any other result so
basically when we determine that r2 is
zero instead of producing a result for
r0 we mark the r0 in the Rob as I mean
the result in the Rob is now going to be
exception instead of a value when the
divide reaches the commit point at that
point the add still hasn't committed and
everything before divide did so at that
point we can just do the kind of wait
for drain you know kind of flush
everything including the divide at this
point and then jump to the exception
Handler and now we have a stable state
for the handler which is here basically
everything before the divide finished
they divide and everything after they
didn't finish which is exactly the state
that would divide by zero exception
handler should be seeing similarly for a
load that would here have a page fault
we would have the same situation of when
the page fault reaches the commit we
have committed everything before the
page fault and we haven't committed the
page fault itself or anything after it
so there is a very nice resume point for
the page fault exception handler when we
go back there and load the page from the
disk we can jump back to the load of the
store and then start executing from here
and because nothing here has already
executed everything is fine the second
problem with exceptions that we had with
those phantom exceptions basically if we
predicted that the branch here is not
taken we would execute this divide and
maybe get the exception like divide by
zero and at the time when we get that
exception maybe the branch is still not
resolved so when we finally resolve the
branch it is too late because the divide
by zero has already been triggered so
how does an arrow be handle this well
the result of this instruction is now
going to be marked
exception in its arabe as the comet
reaches the branch at that point or
before it depending on what kind of
branch misprediction strategy we have we
will figure out that the branch has been
mispredicted and that we really wanted
to jump to this label here at that point
I divide that anything over here is not
committed basically we haven't committed
anything after the branch so we can just
cancel these instructions they never
reach commit and thus the exception here
is never triggered so the idea with
exception handling is simply treat the
exception just as any other result and
delay the actual handling of exceptions
until the instruction that is triggering
the exception commits at that point we
know exactly what the resume point is
for the exception handler and we know
that we won't have any phantom
exceptions because we would never reach
the commit of this divide unless this
divide was on the correct path for all
the branches basically if there was a
misprediction we would have canceled
this divide long before it reaches the
commit point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
