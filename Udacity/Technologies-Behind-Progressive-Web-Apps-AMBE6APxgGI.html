technology the naval progressive web
apps to be reliable fast and engaging
service workers and the web app manifest
file let's take a look at service
workers first most web apps are built on
a client-server model without a server
there is no web app but service workers
changes that service workers are a
progressive enhancement for the network
stack and sit between the browser and
the server acting as a client-side proxy
written in JavaScript that means you can
cash assets locally so no matter what
kind of network the users connected to
apps load near instantly apps can even
work offline because the serviceworker
will respond to network requests once a
service worker is registered it can do
more than just act as a client-side
proxy you can define what events will
wake it up events like push messages can
wake up a service worker and re-engage
the user with notifications or data can
be seamlessly synced to your servers
when a network connection is restored
and what's amazing is that they don't
rely on the web app being open in a tab
or even the browser being open on mobile
service workers are two progressive web
apps as XML HTTP request was to Ajax
they give progressive web apps the power
to exist beyond the browser the second
fundamental piece of technology is the
web app manifest file which gives you
the ability to control how your app
appears to the user in areas where they
would expect to see apps and more
importantly how they can launch it when
a set of heuristics are met the web app
install banner will even prompt users to
add your app to their home screen then
when the user opens it from the home
screen it opens full screen no browser
UI and it's a top-level app in a task
switcher so it feels just like any other
app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
