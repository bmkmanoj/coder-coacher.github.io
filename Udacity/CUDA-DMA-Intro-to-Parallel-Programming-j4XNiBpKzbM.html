designed to make it easier to use shared
memory while achieving high performance
now to use CUDA dma programmers declare
CUDA DMA objects for each shared memory
buffer that needs to be loaded or stored
and the cool thing is that could a DMA
lets you explicitly described the
transfer pattern for that data so for
example you might be transferring one
long sequential chunk of memory you
might be transferring stride 2 chunks of
memory or you might be doing some sort
of indirect access to memory such as
you'd find in a sparse matrix
representation as with cub decoupling
the transfer patterns from the actual
processing that you're going to do on
each thread to achieve that transfer
pattern has several benefits it improves
programmability because the code is now
simpler you packaged away all of that
logic for doing the transfer separately
from the actual compute in your kernel
it improves portability because you can
have the CUDA DMA ninjas or the cub
ninjas develop the very best
implementations of these various
transfer patterns for your situation and
package that all up in a library for you
and because those CUDA ninjas are good
at what they do you get high performance
you're going to achieve high DRAM memory
bandwidth you're going to hide them
global memory latency for kernels that
don't have a lot of occupancy and
hopefully this will lead to better
compiler generated code and as I said
these benefits really accrue to both cub
which tackles the whole circle from
bringing data in from global memory and
doing the computation on it as well as
cuda dma which is just tackling the top
part of that cycle where you're bringing
memory into shared memory and then
you're going to do your own operations
on it so these benefits really accrue to
both both approaches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
