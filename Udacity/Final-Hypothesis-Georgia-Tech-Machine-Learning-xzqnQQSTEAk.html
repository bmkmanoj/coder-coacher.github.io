constructing D does for you and
connecting it to the hardest examples so
now that gets us to a nice little trick
where we can talk about how we actually
output our final example so the way you
construct your final example the way you
do that combination in the step is
basically by doing a weighted average
and the weight is going to be based upon
this alphys atif so the final hypothesis
is just the sgn function the weighted
sum of all of the rules of thumb all of
the weak classifiers that you've been
picking up over all of these time steps
where they're weighted by the Alpha sub
T's and remember the office of T is one
half of the natural log of 1 minus
epsilon T over epsilon T that is to say
it's a measure of how well you're doing
with respect to the underlying error so
you get more weight if you do well then
if you do less well where you get less
weight so what does this look like to
you well it's a weighted average based
upon how well you're doing or how we'll
each of the the individual hypotheses is
doing and then you pass it through a
threshold in where if it's below zero
you say you know what negative and if
it's above zero you say you know what
positive and if it's zero then you just
throw up your hands and in return of
zero in other words you return literally
the sign of the number so you are
throwing Li information there and I'm
not going to tell you what it is now but
when we go to the next lesson it's going
to turn out that that little bit of
information you throw away is actually
pretty important but that's just a
little bit of a teaser we'll get back to
that there okay so this is boosting
Michael there's really nothing else to
it you have a very simple algorithm
which gave me written down in a couple
of lines the hardest parts are
constructing the distribution which I
show you how to do over here and then
simply bringing everything together
which I show you how to do over here all
right yeah I think it doesn't seem so
bad on I feel like I could code this up
but I would be a little happier if I had
a handle on what Y alpha is the way that
it is well there's two answers the first
answer is you use natural logs because
you're using Exponential's and that's
always a cute thing to do and of course
you're using the error term as a way of
measuring how good the hypothesis is and
the second answer is
is it's in the reading you were supposed
to have done so go back and read the
paper now that you've listened to this
and you will have a much better
understanding of what it's trying to
tell you thanks you're welcome I'm about
helping others Michael you know that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
