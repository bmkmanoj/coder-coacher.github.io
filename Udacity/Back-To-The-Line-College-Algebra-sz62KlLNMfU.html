this equation for our line earlier it
makes a little bit more sense remember
that we had y minus T equals M times X
minus s but what does this really mean
let's think back to what we called
different parts of her line a different
characteristics over line when we
created this equation well this T was
our y coordinate of the point that we
knew so this left-hand side of the
equation really says y minus the y
coordinate and on the right side and was
our slope and s was our x-coordinate so
we've just arrived another way to work
out the equation of a line that's pretty
impressive this is really incredible
that you guys did this yourself now
anytime that we know the coordinates of
a point on a line SNT or the
x-coordinate in the y coordinate and we
know the slope of the line we can
automatically right that Lions equation
this is a super super powerful tool
however I'm lazy and writing it out this
way is really time consuming but writing
it in the original way does really show
us what s and T actually stand for it's
a little bit less clear what the meaning
of these letters is let's see what we
can do about this instead of calling our
point here st i think you should call it
x1 y1 that way whenever we use these
terms in the equation we know what kind
of values they are we know whatever is
in the place of x1 is going to be an
x-coordinate and whatever's in the place
of y1 is going to be a y-coordinate so
that updates this equation remember that
Y and X here are general variables but
x1 and y1 will be fixed values that we
pick based on a concrete point that we
know these values will vary as we move
up and down the line these values will
stay fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
