that I'm making sure and wait for it oh
I'm not sure what I'm looking at
it says house shopping list and then
there's nothing underneath like Who am I
shopping with what items are we buying
do you have any more data on this well
it's an early prototype okay okay but I
hear what you're saying it seems like
you want more data then go how the
initial user Tesco did they like it gray
seemed underwhelmed JP the users want
more data to be shown in the app well
you should give the people what they
want yeah
if putting a list of lists mmm sounds
hard and a bit beyond version 0.1 but we
could start by trying to store two
pieces of data with a shopping list
instead of just the name of the list we
could store the name and the owner the
owner will need to be a dummy value
though since we don't have any user
accounts working well I have heard that
you can convert simple Java objects into
a firebase database Jason
so we could make the shopping list an
object with two fields and then stored
in the database I'll take a look at it
with our developer when you're working
in Java and storing data you might find
that it'd be really great if you could
just save an object to the database in
this case I bet you'd really like to
store a shopping list object which let's
say has a name and an owner to start now
it is possible in firebase to make a
hashmap with a collection of key value
pairs and then you can use that hash map
to change your data in firebase you can
easily forget a key value pair though so
this is not the recommended way to do it
the expert recommended way to do this is
to make a POJO
aka a plain old Java object and then you
can use firebase is built-in
serialization capabilities to both put
Java objects into the database and take
back out Java objects to allow the
firebase SDK to do this our object
structure needs to adhere to a few
simple rules and here they are let's go
ahead and take a look at each of these
the first rule is that every instance
variable must match your children's key
names in firebase when your object goes
into firebase it's basically going to
look like this you'll have some sort of
route
and that a bunch of properties that
correspond to member variables of the
object and these keys here need to match
the member variable names exactly also
the types for all these variables should
be Java types that firebase could handle
and those types are boolean strings logs
doubles lists containing objects that
are any of these maps containing strings
and objects that are any of these and
any other firebase pojos these two
values happen to be strings so we're all
set there Rule two you must have at
least an empty constructor in your POJO
object you can make other constructors
and you don't need to use the empty
constructor but it does need to be there
and rule three is that you need public
getter method for every member variable
for example here's a public getter
method for owner
it should say get and then the member
variables name in camel case okay so
let's do this in the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
