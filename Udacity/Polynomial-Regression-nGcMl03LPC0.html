works when you've got you're trying to
fit your data to a constant function
zero order polynomial but let's let's at
least talk through how you do this in
the more general case this is this is
what I've been doing to to fit various
curves to the data at least implicitly
so what we're really trying to do is
we've got a set of data X&amp;amp;Y
set and examples of X's and their
corresponding Y's and what we're trying
to find is these coefficients c0 c1 c2
c3 let's say if we're trying to do cubic
regression where c0 gets added to c1
times X which gets added to c2 times x
squared which gets added to c3 times X
cubed and we're trying to get that to
look a lot like Y now we're not going to
get it to exactly equal Y but let's
pretend for a moment that we could we
have a bunch of these examples and we
want it to work for all of them so we
can arrange all of the all these
constraints all these equations into
matrix form if you're familiar with
linear algebra so the way that we can
write this is here the here the
coefficients that we're looking for the
C's and here what we're going to
multiply them by we're going to take the
X 1 and look at 0 with power the first
power the second power the 3rd power and
that equation I'll use my hands because
that's I always I always need to use my
hands when I do matrix multiplication so
you're going to across here and down
there to multiply these and add and that
needs to correspond to y1 and same thing
this now the second row multiplied by
these coefficients need to give us our
y2 and so forth all right so if we
arrange all these X values into a matrix
and we'll call it you know X and then we
have these other guys and we'll call
this W like the coefficients obviously W
stands for coefficients and we want that
to sort of equal this vector of Y's and
we basically just need to solve this
equation for the WS now we can't exactly
solve it because it's not going to
exactly equal but we can solve it in the
least square sense so let me just step
through this
for doing that all right so let's so
here's how we're going to solve for W so
what we're going to do is pre multiplied
by the transpose of X both sides I mean
really what we wanted to do at first is
if we're solving for y we need to
multiply by the inverse of X but this
isn't really going to necessarily be
well-behaved but if we pre multiply by
the X transpose then this thing is going
to have a nice inverse so now we can pre
multiply by that inverse all right now
conveniently because this has a nice
inverse and inverses cancel each other
we get that the weights we're looking
for can be derived by taking the X
matrix times its own transpose inverting
that multiplying by X transpose and then
multiplying it by the Y and that gives
us exactly the coefficients that we need
to have done our polynomial regression
and it just it just so happens that we
have some nice properties in terms of
these X transpose X not only is it
invertible but it does the right thing
in terms of minimizing the least squares
it does it as a projection now we're not
going to go through the process that by
which we argue that this is true does
that have something to do with the
calculus it most likely has something to
do with calculus and we'll get back to
calculus later but in this particular
case we can we're just using projections
in linear algebra but and most
importantly the whole process is just we
take the the data we arrange it into
this matrix with whatever sort of powers
that we care about and then we just
compute this quantity and we're good to
go okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
