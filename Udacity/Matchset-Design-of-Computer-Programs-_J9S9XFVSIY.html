so and I've left out a couple pieces to
give you something to do but let me
first try to explain how it works so we
take a pattern and a text we're breaking
down the pattern into its components and
the components are an operator and then
an X and a y part depending on the
definition and so for example the
literal will only have an X component
sequence and alternative will have both
an X and a Y we'll see how that
component is written later but for now
just assume it's kind of pick out the
right pieces and then we decide which
operator we have literal sequence alt
and so on and return a proper set
accordingly
so for example if the operator is asking
for a literal string X we asked does the
text start with X if it does then the
remainder will be a singleton set a set
of just one element which is the
remainder of the text after we've broken
off the length of text characters so if
we matched a three character sequence
for X we return the text without the
first three characters if X was one
character we returned the text without
the first character otherwise we return
the null set there's no match the
alternative is particularly nice it says
if we have an alternative between x and
y we just returned the union of those
two match sets this character the or bar
means Union and Python union of two sets
sequence is a complicated one it says if
we're asked for a sequence of x and y we
first find the matching set for X that's
going to be a set of possible remainders
and we go through all of those and then
take the remainder of that text which is
the t1 and then match Y against that
remainder and for each of those
alternatives that's what we're going to
return in the set so for example if this
is our pattern sequence of star literal
a plus literal B looks like that and
we're matching against a a B then the
maps then X is the star literal a and Y
is a plus literal B and the match set
for X is this set here we try to match
why the plus literal
against all of these match sets and
it'll fail to match against each of
these three it will match against this
one and so now we have a match
that consumes the entire string and the
result from the match of the sequence of
x and y will be the set consisting of
just the empty string because we've
matched off all the a's and 1b and
there's no remainder left over note that
there's a big difference between the
outcome of saying and here's a result
consisting of one string the empty
string versus a set that's the empty set
so the empty set is a failed match and
the set consisting of the empty string
that's a successful match now let's see
you can fill in your code for these two
missing cases here remember you're going
to be returning a set of possible
remainders if the match is successful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
