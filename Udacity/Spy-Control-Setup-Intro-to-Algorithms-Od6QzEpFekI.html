a world expert in discrete mathematics
and combinatorics and a mathematics and
computer science professor at Dartmouth
College his work has had substantial
impact on the design of algorithms and
theoretical computer science he's also a
celebrated collector of mathematical
puzzles having written two books on the
subject as well as a monthly column for
the communications of the ACM now since
I've started off every unit with a
mathematical magic trick I thought Peter
would be an excellent person to beguile
us with a few fascinating tricks of his
own by the puzzle in my book about a spy
who's tried to convey information to her
control but the only means she has for
conveying information is that there is a
a 15 bit radio broadcast every morning
and she has the ability if she wishes to
alter one bit of that broadcast but she
doesn't know in advance what the
broadcast will be and so this is a case
where potentially there are 16 different
things she can do there 15 bits she can
alter or she could choose not to alter
anything which means that in theory
perhaps she could convey as many as four
bits of information this way well
surprisingly she can actually do that
all right let's make sure that we
understand this setup here I'm going to
do this as a magic trick so I'm a spy
and I'm in enemy territory and I've got
a message 0110 that I need to transmit
to my boss now that's going to be tricky
to do because I don't want anybody to
know that I'm a spy in enemy territory
fortunately there's a radio broadcast
tower in enemy territory and every day
it sends out a 15 bit message there's
there's an example of a 15 bit message
now I can use that message to
communicate with my boss but I can't
just change it arbitrarily to something
completely different because then people
will know that something weird has
happened but I can flip just one bit so
I can zap the message and
just one of the bits and my boss then is
going to hear that and we'd like him to
actually interpret that as the message
that I wanted to send so let's see if it
worked hmm based on the 15 bit broadcast
I'm hearing and the protocol that my
spine I arranged in advance I know the
message he is sending to me is 0 1 1 0
nice work agent p tada here's what you
can do and and the solution involves
members which come up in other problems
as well so a number is just a binary
number what makes it different from an
ordinary number is that when you add two
of them you add without carry so they're
they're added like like like vectors in
a vector space over z2 and they're
called Nimbus nor called nippers by John
Conway because as you may know they are
useful and analyzing a game of NIMH so
what we can do is we take these 15 bits
and just we number them from from 1 to
15 but instead of thinking of those
numbers as ordinary decimal numbers we
think of them as numbers so each each
position as a nonzero number starting
with 0 0 1 for the first position and
ending with 1111 for the 15th position
what the spy wants to do is to convey
some number of her choice to her control
so for example suppose she wants to
convey the number 1 100 to her control
and what she's going to do is she's
going to simply tell her control look at
this radio broadcast after I've altered
it and add up the numbers of all the
positions where you see one now when the
spy sees the radio broad
there's she looks at at what the number
is currently add up to say the number is
currently at up to 10 10 then if she
changed the 1010 bit they would add up
to 0 0 0 0 so that's what she would do
if she wanted to convey 0000 yeah she
wants to convey 1100 so she adds that to
1010 it gives her a number she changes
the value of the bit at that number and
it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
