oriented concepts led to what we call
all ad object oriented analysis and
design
OAD is a software engineering approach
whose main characteristic is to model a
software system as a group of
interacting objects and we'll see what
that means in particular in this lesson
we will specifically focus on the first
part of this object-oriented analysis
which is a requirements analysis
technique that concentrates on modeling
real-world objects and as I usually like
to do I would like to start by providing
some historical perspective on object
oriented analysis to better understand
how we went from a function centric
world to a data centric world and
several people contributed to this shift
in perspective but I'd like to mention a
few that were particularly influential
starting from James Rumble which in the
90s developed an integrated approach to
object-oriented modeling with three main
aspects a data aspect so the modeling
was based on using an extended version
of entity relationship diagrams to
describe classes and inheritance so
that's what was called the object model
and the second aspect has to do with
functions so dataflow diagrams were used
to represent the functional aspects of
the system where each function was then
becoming a method in a class so this is
what is called the functional model so
object model functional model the third
model in Rambo's methodology had to do
with control so it was representing the
dynamic aspects of a system and is used
as state machines which we will cover in
more detail to represent how a system
would evolve going from one state to the
other based on what happened to the
system these three models together
represented what was called the object
modeling technique or OMT and OMT
combined with contribution from several
people and in particular Jacobson and
Bush evolved into what we call a unified
modeling language which is UML which is
probably the modeling language that most
of you are familiar with UML extends Ont
by providing more diagrams and a broader
view of a system from multiple
perspectives so in the second part of
the lesson we will cover some of these
diagrams in details but before that I'd
like to talk a little bit more about
object-oriented analysis
and how we can perform it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
