case of the general bind operation that
I described to you and it is a special
case in the following sense password
that the user has for logging into the
system at any point of time is used as
the handshake key to start with and
username is used as a client ID so to
initiate the login session the login
process the user name given to the user
as the client ID and the password as the
HKC but other than that it follows
exactly the same sequence of validating
itself to the server and similarly
validating the server to the client and
at the end of the validation of both the
client and the server what the server
gives back to the login process as I
mentioned earlier are a pair of tokens
the secret token and the clear token and
these two tokens have to be sent
securely on the wire which is insecure
so what the server would do is encrypt
these two using password as the
handshake key and therefore the login
process can use the password to decrypt
the message that comes back from the
login server and get these two tokens
secret token and clear token and these
two tokens are kept by Venus for the
rest of this login session and as we
know once we've gotten these two tokens
because clear token is a data structure
that contains the handshake key needed
by Venus for establishing RPC session
the rest of the life is made for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
