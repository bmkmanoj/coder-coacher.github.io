conditions you want to combine them for
example maybe you want to do something
if one condition is true or another one
in Java there are three operators that
you can use to combine conditions they
look like this
the two ampersands are an and these two
vertical bars or an or and the
exclamation mark somewhat unintuitive li
is a knot you might find it useful to
remember that the not equal operator
that you've seen a few units ago also
has the exclamation mark let me show you
a few examples for using these operators
and once again we'll be looking at flags
where the visual appearance should help
you let's start with this maritime flag
for the letter D here I made a sketch of
this flag when you're in the middle a
pixel should be blue and otherwise it
should be yellow so how do we express
when you're in the middle when the Y
value is greater than this level and
less than this level that's what our
hand comes in then we're in the middle
this here is one fifth of the total
height so we have two conditions namely
y is at least height over five and the
other condition is y is at most height
times 4 over 5 both conditions have to
be fulfilled for us to be in the middle
so we use the and operator here it is
let's just try this out here is the
condition that you just saw with the and
operator here and in this case we return
blue otherwise we return yellow in this
case I will make a square flag and here
it is so the and operator worked out for
us because we wanted Y to be at least
here and most here both conditions had
to be true for the blue color now let's
look at another flag I've sketched up
the flag here and the question is when
should a pixel be blue in this case
there are four conditions the x value
should be at least width over third that
means it's over here the x value should
be at most which times 2/3 that makes it
over here the Y value should be at least
the height over 3 and the y value should
be at most the height times 2/3 all
those four conditions need to be
fulfilled for a pixel to be blue now
it's your turn you'll get to write a
program that draws this flag here
with a bit of blue in the inside and
white outs on the outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
