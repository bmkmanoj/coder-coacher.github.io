the fact that well we may need to change
our design a lot so how we're gonna do
that there's gonna be expensive well
it's not very expensive if we can do
efficient refactoring which is another
one of the important XP practices and
what does it mean to refactor it means
to take a piece of code whose design
might be sub optimal because for example
we evolved it we didn't take into
account that from the beginning some of
the features that had to be added later
probably because we didn't even know
about this feature because the
requirements evolved so we're gonna take
this piece of code and we're gonna
restructure it so that it becomes simple
and maintainable developers are expected
to refactor as soon as opportunities for
improvement are found and that happens
for example before adding some code you
might look at the code that you're about
to modify or to which you're about to
add parts and say can we change the
program to make the addition simple that
helps maintainability or we can do it
after adding some code to our code base
we will look at the code the resulting
code and say well can we make the
program simpler while still running all
the tests and the key point here is that
we don't want to refactor on speculation
but we want to refactor on demand on the
system and the process needed again the
goal is just to keep the code simple and
maintainable not to overdo it and as I
mentioned before we're gonna have a
whole lesson the next lesson on
refactoring so we're gonna go in more
depth in the discussion of this topic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
