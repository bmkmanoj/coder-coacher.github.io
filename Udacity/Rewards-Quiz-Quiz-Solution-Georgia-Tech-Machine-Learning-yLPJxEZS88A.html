all right
which should I do I need to make any
assumption or can I make any assumptions
I want about the non blue states no it
doesn't matter actually so the answer
may be does the answer's no but it
doesn't actually matter because remember
it's all very stationary in and
Markovian so the only thing that matters
is where you are you're stationary
Markovian all right so I think okay so
let's let's do the first one then so so
this is this is pretty cool so by
changing the reward the way that you did
it is now it's not a hot Beach anymore
it's like you know like super awesome
money Beach yes it's like a beach made
of bacon sure okay
let's think of it that one either of us
are eating bacon at the moment at the
moment because because then our mouths
would be full and it would be very
difficult to give this lecture all right
so no no no I mean like even all right
never mind the point is that it's
awesome and there's like diamonds I
don't know I just saw the Hobbit movie
and there was a room filled entirely
with treasures and so this is kind of
like that and so now the question is
what should I be doing like I should
never go to the plus one or the minus
one because that ends my treasure
gathering I should just continue to stay
in states that aren't those states okay
so I would say left for the for the top
state mm-hmm let's say left for the
bottom State this one though yeah uh-huh
okay and the other two I need to think
about for a moment so I feel like I'd
like to get away from the minus one
mm-hmm so like you know to go up but
then that would give me some chance of
slipping wouldn't it mm-hmm let's say I
don't want to go to the right I don't
want to go down I don't want to go I'm
gonna go to the left
mm-hmm I'm gonna bash my head against
the wall because then I get money yeah
that's weird
there's really no pain for running into
the wall you just stay where you are
all right and and for the bottom one I
feel like it's the same kind of thing I
don't want to go to the right or to the
left because then there's a probability
that I'll slip and end up ending my game
so I'm gonna go down yeah I like that so
most of these are right
one of them is wrong or oh it's not that
it's wrong it's just it's not as right
as it could be which one do you think
that is I think they're right but if
there's one that I could imagine you not
being so happy with which is the bottom
one there are two bottom ones you mean
this one yeah yeah what would I like I
think you might prefer if I bash my head
no actually it turns out that this is a
correct answer so all four of these are
correct but in this particular state it
actually doesn't matter which way you go
oh I see a more complete answer would be
doesn't matter
yeah and is that true of any of the
other ones no I guess I guess you're
right the other ones you have to go in
the direction indicator right so by the
way just like here it doesn't matter
which direction you go in it's actually
true for all of the other states as well
it doesn't matter where you go because
in these three states these are the only
states or you can accident you could end
the game and in each of them you can
take an action that guarantees that you
don't in the game so it really doesn't
matter about where you do within the
other states cool right so that's a good
argument this makes a lot of sense so in
the end of the day basically because the
reward is positive and you're just
accumulating reward or diamonds and
treasure as you put it you just never
want to leave so you can always want to
avoid either these states it doesn't
matter that there's a positive one here
and a negative one here if I can stay
here forever then I just accumulate
positive reward forever okay so what's
the next one so interesting so now now
the beach is really really hot it's
minus two so mm-hmm
I want to get off here as quickly as I
can so definitely the top one I would go
to the right and just try to get that
plus one and get out of get out of here
you know all right so then let's think
about the bottom right okay so in the
best of all possible worlds I go around
and dump into the plus one so that and
that would take me again if if I don't
slip at all
one two three four steps to do that
mm-hmm actually wait one two three three
steps on the hot sand you know and I'm
getting a minus two for each of those so
that's like minus six mm-hmm so I could
get that plus one at the end and that
makes it only minus five but I think I'd
rather just get off
the beach so I'm gonna say in the bottom
right to actually dive into the pit of
pain because it can't be as bad as where
I am that's exactly right so okay so
then the one next to it on the left is a
little trickier if I go up to the plus
one I get a minus two followed by a plus
one which is also minus one mm-hmm so
okay I'm not so sure about that one well
remember you'll always have some
probability of ending up back where you
started is that true oh because if I
know that's not true if I dive straight
into the minus one then I have point
eight chance of going to the minus one
point two of going up to the arrow
that's labeled point two going down to
the blue box that's not labeled mm-hmm
weight point two no put one mm-hmm
whereas if I go up right I might stay
where I am and a crew - - like yeah I
feel like I need a calculator for this
yeah but your I think your intuition is
right though just think about it as how
much I mean what do you think has the
best chance of most quickly ending
things well certainly jumping into the
minus one right I think that's going to
be marginally better because there's
only one chance of slippage and delay
whereas if I take an additional step
there's two chances of slippage and
delay exactly that's exactly the right
kind of argument to makin and because
the minus two is so big you're gonna
you're just better off inning and even
if you ended in pain in the same way
that you were in the bottom right hand
corner and so bottom left I would say
the cleanest thing would be to jump into
the minus one so to go to the right so
that I can go up and get into the minus
one and what's nice about that move is
that you either end up in the bottom
right hand corner or you end up staying
where you are or you end up moving up
but in either case you were always sort
of you know you you never get farther
away right whereas if you tried to go up
there's a chance that you would get
farther away interesting is there a way
to be sure about these yeah you just
have to do the math do we know how to do
the math yeah you just start you just do
expectations you can basically just say
well what's the expected time since you
know what you're trying to do here is to
get to the end you can just you could
calculate the expected length of time
it'll take you to get there and then
just you know multiply by all the
rewards you're gonna get in the mean
time
if it helps though I will tell you that
for any value where the reward is less
than minus one point six to eight for
this is the right thing to do okay just
so you know all right so you're saying
you actually do know that this is the
optimal the thing that we have written
yes I know that this is the operator let
me just draw out the rest of it for you
so it's it's I think interesting to
compare this one the bottom right one
where you've given me negative reward to
encourage me to end the game
with our main one up here in the upper
left where you've also given me some
negative ward to encourage me to end the
game if you look carefully you'll notice
that in this one you're encouraged to
end the game but you're really
encouraged to in the game at a +1 here
the reward is so strongly negative you
just need to end the game and so you end
up with a different response here
because this is it's just as quick to
get to the minus one and injured pain is
to take this extra step and try to get
to the plus one and you end up with a
different response here here here in
here that's really interesting yeah it
is and so these changes matter and they
matter a great deal so how am I supposed
to choose my rewards carefully and with
some 1/4 log thanks but you know again
there's lots of ways to think about this
so the way we've been sort of talking
about MVPs is kind of the way we've been
talking about we talked in the first
part of the course when we talked about
having teachers and learners you can
think of your reward is sort of the
teaching signal and sort of the teacher
telling you what you ought to do in what
you ought not to do but another way of
thinking about this is that because the
rewards define the MDP the rewards are
our domain knowledge I see
so if you're going to design an MVP to
capture some world then you want to
think carefully about how you set the
rewards in order to get the behavior
that you wish that's fair I mean it
seems a little bit like a cop-out but I
think it seems like a necessary one yeah
I mean there's really I mean again no
matter what you do you've got to be able
to inject domain knowledge somehow or
otherwise there's no learning
to do and in this case the reward
basically is telling you how important
it is to get to the end cool okay all
right let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
