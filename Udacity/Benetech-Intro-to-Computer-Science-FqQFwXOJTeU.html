the director of Benetech tell us about
what Dennis exists a Benetech is Silicon
Valley's nonprofit technology company
and we exist a combat market failure
basically when something doesn't make
enough money but does a lot of social
good we want to develop software that
delivers solutions for that social
problem so what kinds of things you
actually build well we write software in
three different major areas the first
one is education especially for kids
with disabilities so like we run the
largest library for the print disabled
the blind in the world online and we
also write software for human rights
movement with your grassroots group or a
truth commission or a war crimes
tribunal and our third area is the
environment we write project management
software for environmentalists that are
running campaigns or managing programs
on the ground to actually sort of have
the same kind of tools you would have in
a for-profit but because you're in the
environment now you've got one and I
heard you're starting a new project for
coding for social good yeah we it's in
it's in a pilot phase right now it's
called social coding for good and you
can kind of think of it as an online
matching site for geeks that want to do
social good so you tell us your passion
your technical skill and your time
availability and will hopefully match
you up with a project like Wikimedia or
the Guardian project helping him rights
groups or you know whatever other sort
of project that matches up with your
goals it's just in a pilot phase but
we're hoping that the next year it goes
to scale so the geeks all over the world
that want to do social good can get a
chance to go to a place that github do
some volunteering and get some good cred
for having done something socially good
so how much experience would students
need to have to be able to start doing
this well you know I think that people
in different levels of the professional
area of software development can
actually help I think our initial target
audience is to work on people who are in
the profession people were working for
high tech companies or software
developers but the human rights the
environment education need people at all
sort of different levels so whether it
could be characterizing a bug or writing
some documentation and artful of courses
people can increase and improve their
skills by doing volunteering for social
good and then hopefully that leads to a
job either doing social good or maybe a
regular job so it sounds like you found
ways to do lots of Billy
official things with technology can you
tell us what are the social
responsibilities that someone who gets
power because they learn about
technology should have well you know I
think that being educated in a
profession like software development you
have a responsibility to give back to
society now many people do that by
actually getting a job in creating
products that have value but the thing I
want to talk to engineers about is you
know as you go out there and you see
problems that are important to society
and they can take advantage of your
skills don't ignore them just because
they don't make a lot of money you know
I think that there are ways to make a
living or volunteer to actually help
these issues and I think that that's
really an area of terrific satisfaction
as a tool maker when you see the great
things that people do with your tools
solve big social problems and actually
find a way to change the world for the
better not just for more money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
