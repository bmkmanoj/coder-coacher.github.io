discussed and see how a requirements
engineering process actually works so
first of all we saw the requirements
engineering consists of three main steps
elicitation of the requirements in which
we extract requirements from various
sources modeling in which we represent
the requirements using one or more
notations or formalisms and analysis in
which we identify possible issues with
our requirements and there is actually a
fourth step that we kind of mentioned
but not explicitly and this is the
negotiation that can happen between the
stakeholders and the developers during
which requirements are discussed and
modified until an agreement is reached
so if you want to think of this as a
process so as a sequence of steps we can
see that we start from elicitation so we
start by eliciting an initial set of
requirements we negotiate and refine
this set then we model the resulting
requirements and finally we analyze such
requirements however the process doesn't
really stop here why well because as a
result of the analysis we might have to
perform further elicitation and so this
process is not really sequential one but
rather an iterative process so in
practice we continue to iterate over
these four steps gathering a better and
better understanding of the requirements
at every iteration until we are happy
with the set of requirement that we
gather and stop the process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
