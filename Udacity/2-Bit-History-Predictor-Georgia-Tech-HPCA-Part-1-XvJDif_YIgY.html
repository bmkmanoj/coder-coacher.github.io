that the one bit predictor cannot really
predict well the pattern n and T that
repeats we will see that a 2 bit history
will be successfully predicting this
pattern how does a 2 bit history
predictor work same as before we take
the pc and we index into the branch
history table from which we get an entry
now however the entry we get has 5
pieces it has 2 bits of history so these
are the last two outcomes of this branch
and then we have four times a two bit
counter one for each possible history so
with two bits we will index into this
array of counters and use the
appropriate counter for the given
history so as you can see the overall
cost of this predictor now is two bits
of history plus four times two so it
ends up costing us 10 bits per branch
instead of going through a lengthy
example of how this works when we try to
predict this pattern let's try to figure
it out the sequence of outcomes is N and
T n n T etc when we are seeing the
outcome of T and trying to predict it
that is we are trying to predict what
will become T our 2 bit history will be
0 0 it's saying that the last two
outcomes we have seen have been both not
taken this history will make us use this
counter here so that counter which will
call counter number 0 will be counting
up when we are trying to predict this
particular outcome our history will be 0
1 we will be using counter number one
and we will decrement it because we are
seeing a non taking decision when we are
trying to predict this the history will
be 1 0 this is corresponds to counter
number 2 which will also be decremented
for this now we will again use the
history of 0 0 because the last two
outcomes have been not taken this means
that the counter number is 0 because of
this taken this
we'll be incremented and so on as you
can see counter zero always counts up so
very soon it will start predicting taken
which means every time we see a history
of zero zero we will start predicting
strong taking counter one keeps counting
down so very soon after singles history
of zero 1 we will predict strong not
taken
and similarly counter 2 is always
counting down so very soon we will start
predicting not taken when we see a
history of 1 zero as you can see what's
now going to happen is pretty much this
counter zero here we'll start to predict
strong taken counter one will start to
predict strong note taken and counter
two is going to predict strong not taken
counter number three which is the last
counter we have actually never gets used
because we never see a history of 1:1
that would mean that we have seen I take
and followed by taken which doesn't
happen in this particular pattern so as
you can see this predictor starts being
a perfect predictor after a while after
these counters have been appropriately
modified depending on the starting state
so unlike a single bit history predictor
a two bit history can predict this
pattern accurately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
