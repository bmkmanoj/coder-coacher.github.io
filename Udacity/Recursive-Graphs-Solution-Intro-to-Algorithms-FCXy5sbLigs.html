we know that if N equals one it just
returns a single node N equals two it's
going to recursively generate a single
node for G 1 a single node for G 2 then
randomly choose nodes from those sets
which in this case are just the only
nodes that are there so it'll choose
them and then it connects them up
that's what N equals to looks like for N
equals 4 we have 2n equals twos right G
1 and G 2 are both going to be an N
equal to graph let me draw those then
it's going to randomly choose one of the
nodes and one of the nodes and connect
them up so far it looks kind of like a
chain in all these cases let's go to the
next case again for N equals 8 it has to
generate N equals 4 graphs each of which
has to generate a bunch of n over 2
graphs which all look like this there's
going to be some randomness about how
they get connected up so it could be
maybe and one of the times we call it we
get something like this and one of the
times we get something like this
then we connect randomly the to N equals
four graphs to get the N equals eight
graph and maybe that'll be something
like this so in this particular case now
we don't have a chain anymore we do on
the other hand have a tree and in fact
this property continues as we get bigger
and bigger graphs we're always
connecting up some kind of tree
structure with some other kind of tree
structure I'll draw another one and we
connect up these two tree structures and
that just gives us a bigger tree
structure so we get a nice messy
recursively defined tree but it's still
a tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
