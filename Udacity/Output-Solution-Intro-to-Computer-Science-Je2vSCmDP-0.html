answer this one we have to look at the
code after the procedure and remember we
said the procedures replacing these four
lines after the procedure what we do is
print the value of URL so that we means
we definitely need at least URL as our
output and all of the choices here
included URL but that's not all we do
so we have to look at the second line as
well well this uses both page and end
quote the value of page here is the same
as the value of page before the
procedure so we don't actually need to
return the value of page it doesn't need
to be an output from the procedure
because we already know that we knew
that before we call the procedure the
procedure doesn't change the value of
page no sense making it an output so
this answer doesn't make sense we don't
need page it does make sense to make end
quote one of the outputs and the reason
we want end quote as an output is we
need to know where the end of the quote
was to advance the page so the next time
we look for the next target we don't
find the same one that we just found so
we actually need this so this is the
best answer to this question is that we
need two outputs we need both the URL
and the value of end quote the fourth
possibility could work so if we return
both the URL and the value of start link
well we could figure out a way to
advance the page to not find the same
quote but we'd basically have to redo
all this code we need to look for the
next quote starting from start link we
need to look for the closing quote for
that basically we need to compute the
value of end quote again so it's a lot
more useful to return the value of end
quote than to return the value of start
link that's why the third choice is the
best choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
