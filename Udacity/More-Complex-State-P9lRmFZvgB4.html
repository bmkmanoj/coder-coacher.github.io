the state of the hand so what do you
mean the state of the hand that's
actually you should I encourage you to
read the paper they did a couple of
really cool things first of all you have
translation okay well how many degrees
of freedom in translation well we're
doing it in two dimensions so there's
two degrees of freedom they had a
rotation okay which is one degree of
freedom but the other thing they added
to that was the shape of the hand and
you might ask well how did they encode
the shape of the hand don't bother Megan
well actually what they did was they
took a whole bunch of images of contours
and then they did a form of principal
components analysis now you may not know
what that is but the good news is you
will very soon we're going to do
principal component analysis when we
talk about recognition the thing that
matters is that it has a low dimensional
representation of certain variation and
what they did is they extracted out
essentially instead of keeping rotations
separately they took ten degrees of
freedom that represented the shape of
the hand including rotation so you had
two for translation and 10 for wrote for
the for the rotation and shape so that's
a 12 degree of freedom space so that's
even more difficult to do the tracking
with particles because you have to have
a lot of particles in order to do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
