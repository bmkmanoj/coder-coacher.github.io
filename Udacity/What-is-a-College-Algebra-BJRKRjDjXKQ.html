terms we can get back to grant and his
gleaming glasses earlier we came up with
expressions for the amount of money that
grants going to make from his friends
buying his wipers and also from them
buying his nozzles and we had an
equation for the total amount of money
earned saying that the total amount of
money he's going to earn from his
friends is equal to the amount that they
spent on his wipers plus the amount that
they spent on his nozzles I'm going to
add one more equation into the mix for
you or rather create one more variable
total money earned right here takes a
long time to write so instead I'm going
to call this a different variable let's
say a so with my other equations up here
I can also write total money earned
equals a so let's combine all this
information that we came up with in our
earlier quizzes and the new information
that I just gave you that a stands for
the total amount of money earned which
of these expressions down here do you
think should replace this question mark
in this equation for a you can check as
many answers as you think are right I
know this is a lot to look at on the
screen at one time but once we come up
with this final equation only have
single letters and numbers no more words
in our equation that will make things
much easier for the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
