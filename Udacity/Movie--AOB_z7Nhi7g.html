here on the top right and I'm going to
begin with a blank programming file I
have named it media dot pi and it is
saved inside a folder called movies now
to write a new class I will use the
Python keyword class and I will name it
movie you've probably noticed that the
first letter of the name of the class m
is in uppercase now this letter doesn't
necessarily need to be in uppercase
but the Google style guide for Python
suggests that it should be now what is
this thing called a Google style guide
for Python you ask well let's google it
the first link here looks good to me
now this style guide provides
conventions to programmers all over the
world on how to write their programs if
you scroll down a bit you will notice
that there are conventions on everything
from how to name things to how to write
comments by the way the link to this
webpage is available in the instructor
notes I recommend that you read through
this document if you click on this link
called naming you will notice that when
defining a class name google recommends
that the first letter of that name be in
capital letters ok back to the code now
thus far we've encountered one new
keyword called class in fact we are
going to come across several new words
in this lesson and I want to list them
all in one place for handy reference the
word class is the first one on that list
we will review all the words on this
list before we end this lesson so you
may have noticed that our class is empty
thus far now to figure out what I want
to do next with it I will go back to my
design so here I am back with my class
design now I know that eventually I
would want to create multiple instances
of the class movie instances like Toy
Story and avatar I also know that I have
previously created instances of class
turtle instances like Brad and to do
that I had to write a piece of code that
read turtle turtle so I guess I will
have to write a piece of code like this
to create Toy Story an instance of class
movie
let's do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
