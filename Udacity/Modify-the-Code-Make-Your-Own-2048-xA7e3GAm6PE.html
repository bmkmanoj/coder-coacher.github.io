how can i what's the best way to see
what they look like all right so if we
just open up the HTML file so this is in
the the main directory
this index that HTML files what we were
looking at earlier so we can just open
that up it'll open in your default
browser all right but this is a go we
have our images instead of the numbers
and this is this game is actually much
harder when there's images because you
don't know what's next yeah I don't know
what the numbers I'm doing I just know
that I want the faces and so these are
just US presidents it's the first thing
that came to mind but I mean there's
tons of cool things you could do and the
way did this was I went to the CSS file
so we're in main dot CSS and I went to
all these places where it's talking
about the actual tile property so what
does the two tile look like the four
tile and so on and I started just
overrode the background I think this was
referring to some color yeah so the
original background was for each of
these a different color instead of
instead of an image instead of an image
so we actually if we were doing this for
real we probably want to remove all
those all those backgrounds I think Andy
wanted to be able to revert back if you
wanted to I'm still not comfortable with
version control I know you can just do
that on the fly but I kind of like doing
this and sorry but yeah so I have I made
this folder called tile sets precedents
and then I just called the different
images - for etc and this dot dot slash
so what's going on here if I'm tell me
if I'm thinking about this right
index.html lives somewhere in my
computer yeah inside this 204 8
directory okay
and so the dot dot means to go back up a
directory yeah because this the style
file that we're in is under style so
it's going back to the back up it's 204
eight and then it found and then go to
the tilesets directory which is just
under 200 48
okay and if you open it that's where we
get our presidents and you have out this
files yep cool no what are you gonna do
I don't know but I don't know I don't
know let's keep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
