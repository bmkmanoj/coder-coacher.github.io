pick a location to define the potential
energy U to be equal to zero
and I'm gonna choose just this line here
place where the skier will land and
where all of our Heights are measured
from just to make things nice and easy
so for the first part of the problem I
want to figure out what the speed of the
skier is at this point right here when
he finally just leaves the ramp because
then it's just a projectile motion
problem and we know how to do that from
unit 2 so I want to figure out using
energy techniques what his kinetic
energy and therefore what his speed will
be when he's leaving the ramp right here
now we know from conservation of energy
that the skiers kinetic energy and
potential energy must add up to the same
value in both his starting position here
and when he's just leaving the ramp we
can actually get rid of one of these
four variables already at the beginning
of the jump the skier isn't moving yet
so we know his kinetic energy must be
zero so doing a little algebra I find
that his final kinetic energy should be
equal to the difference between his
original potential energy and his final
potential energy and doing a little
algebra and plugging in the values we
were given we find that the skiers
velocity is 40 meters per second when
he's leaving the ramp here now that I
know the speed of the skier at the tip
of the ramp I can now calculate using
kinematics how far away from the ramp he
will land note that in the previous part
of the problem forty meters per second
was what we called the final speed and
it was for that part it was what the
skier speed was at the end of the first
part of the problem when he was just on
the tip of the ramp but now that forty
meters per second is the original speed
for this second part of the problem when
the skier is flying through the air so
that's why I'm using this convention of
calling this v-0 now so the first thing
I'm gonna do is break this original
velocity into X&amp;amp;Y components based on
this angle alpha and in doing so I find
that the original X velocity is thirty
four point six four meters per second
and the original Y velocity is 20 meters
per second now I'm gonna use this
kinematics equation to solve for the
time T when the skier lands on the
ground and that's when his change in Y
will be minus ten since he's a 10 up
here and then he goes down to zero a
change of minus 10 and doing a little
algebra I arrived at this quadratic
equation now it doesn't look like I can
factor this quadratic equation so I'm
going to have to use the quadratic
formula and plugging these numbers into
the quadratic equation I get
two solutions time equals negative 0.45
seconds and time equals four point four
or five seconds now what's the deal with
this negative time one well if we look
back at our graph we can actually
imagine the skier going backwards in
time on his trajectory and he would
actually intercept the y equals zero
line right about here so that our
solution is actually still correct but
it's not quite what we're looking for in
this problem so instead we're gonna
focus on this positive solution time
equals four point four five seconds that
sounds reasonable it sounds like it
might take about four and a half seconds
for the skier to go in the air and land
back on the ground okay now I'm going to
use this equation to figure out how far
in the X direction the skier travels
during that time he's in the air now
keep in mind there's no acceleration in
the X direction so this term goes to
zero and we're left with just Delta X
equals V zero x times t and plugging in
the numbers we were given we get that
the final change in X the distance D
that the skier lands away from the ramp
is 150 4.1 meters if you got this answer
