modify the interpret function so that
JavaScript elements are the output of
the JavaScript elements are
reinterpreted and run through the HTML
interpreter so instead of just basic
JavaScript output we can actually output
further HTML making our JavaScript quite
a bit more powerful so how do we change
this so that we can do that well first
off we can see that we're not really
concerned with these two branches of
this if statement we're not concerned
with word elements or tag elements we
care about JavaScript elements so we
already know that we don't really need
to do anything right in here we do
something to modify how we interpret
JavaScript so we go down here and the
two lines i added are right here now
instead of just outputting the results
of the javascript interpreters abstract
syntax tree output what I'm doing is I'm
running the result of the inovgrid
interpreter back through the HTML parser
the parse function and outputting that
abstract syntax tree which this is HTML
now and then we run that back through
this function itself so that we can
further interpret the syntax tree now
after we've done that we don't really
need this last graphics dot word result
we don't need to further interpret
result we've already done that so we can
just get rid of this and to check
whether this works we click run and we
see below that we do indeed get our page
output but aha okay so we've got this
JavaScript output but you can see that
the odd numbers are bold and the even
numbers are italicized which if you
check the web page that we gave you as
an example is exactly what we've done
we've wrapped the even amna and odd
numbers or the odd and even numbers
respectively in bold and italic tax
which is what you see down here so this
gives us a lot more power in our
JavaScript interpreter because we can
use our JavaScript to now
output further HTML that we can run on
the fly and that that is going to be
very very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
