more complicated complicated enough that
it cannot be proven simply by applying
one instance of modus ponens imagine
that when you robot found that imagine
that a robot proved to itself that this
box is not liftable and the humans in
the factory who are trying to make fun
of the robot said to the robot well the
reason is not liftable is not because
it's not movable but because your
battery is not working so now the
situation is more complicated the robot
must also check its battery so now the
robot begins with slightly different
knowledge in its knowledge base so
suppose that the knowledge in its
knowledge bases cannot move and battery
full means it's not liftable it finds
from its percepts again it cannot move
so it checks its battery and it's checks
its battery and finds that the battery
is full so there are two new sentences
that get written in the knowledge base
now the knowledge base contains three
sentences as earlier in resolution here
improving the agent must convert all
these sentences and its knowledge base
into a conjunctive normal form that
means that the sentences in current can
contain a literal order disjunction of
literals or a conjunction of disjunction
illrick roles so we begin by removing
the implication from sentence one
because an implication cannot occur in a
conjunctive normal form so when we
remove implication for the first
sentence we get this sentence where the
sentence is not yet satisfactory it is
not yet a conjunctive normal form
because this is a disjunction of
conjunctions and what we want our
conjunctions of disjunctions so we apply
the de Morgan's law and now we get the
following sentence we simply taking the
negation inside which flips the
conjunction into a disjunction and now
we have three literals connected with
disjunctions and this is a conjunctive
normal form disjunction of literals so
now we have in the knowledge base three
sentences all three of them in the
conjunctive normal form either literals
or disjunction of literals recall to the
robot wanted to prove not liftable so it
takes the negation of that this is a
improved by reputation so it considers
liftable so now this knowledge base has
four sentences this fourth sentence is
coming from the negation of what it
wants to prove once again the reasoning
begins by the literal that it wants to
prove in this case liftable and it finds
a sentence in which the negation of the
troll is true so once again we begin
with the sentence s4 because that is
what we want to prove and we find a
sentence in the knowledge base which
contains a literal which is the negation
of the literal in the sentence s for
that we want to prove we resolve on this
because they both cannot be true and
resolution here simply means if we drop
them now in this sentence s one that is
under consideration currently we have
two literals we can begin with either
one of them let us begin with not
battery full we'll try to find a
sentence which contains a negation of
this particular literal there is a
sentence s3 which is a negation of this
so we will resolve on this back rifle
and not battery fool because they both
cannot be true we'll drop them now it's
in dense s1 we are left with just one
literal can move we can try to find a
sentence in the knowledge base which
contains the negation of that literal
here it is and so we can resolve on them
and we resolve on them we drop them and
once we drop them then we have a null
condition which stands for a
contradiction so we reach a
contradiction therefore the assumption
that this was lifted cannot be true
therefore not liftable is true and we
have just shown that resolutions you are
improving in this case proves what the
robot wanted to prove one important
point to note here is that of focus of
attention the cause of the conjunctive
normal form give one important point to
note here is if issue of focus of
attention often when the problem space
is very complex for example when the
number of sentences is very large the
sentence are very complex it can become
really hard for the logical agent to
decide what to focus on but because we
have converted everything in a
conjunctive normal form and because
resolution approving just making
use of resolution therefore at any
particular time the logical agent knows
exactly what to focus on you always
begin with this literal you always try
to find a sentence which contains its
negation you've always resolve on that
you take all the remaining literal in
the sentence and proceed forward this
focus of attention this computational
efficiency of resolution here improving
is arising because a water called horn
clauses a horn clauses is a disjunction
that contains at most one positive
literal this is happening at s1 this is
the disjunction that contains at most
one positive ripple this is a negative
literal this is a negative patrol and if
fact that it contains just one positive
literal is a very powerful idea because
that's where the focus of attention
comes from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
