black boxes are at the inverses of the
equations we started out with I've
written know the steps to find each of
these inverse functions and there's one
important thing I'd like you to notice
to indicate the point at which we switch
from modifying the original function to
modifying the inverse function I changed
colors so the first two steps of each
equation are still working with the
original functions then at the point
where we switch the position of X and
more I we've changed the equation to be
the inverse function all the work with
the inverse function for each of these
is in purple the actual steps that we've
gone through when modifying either the
original function or the inverse
function are pretty standard algebra
there are things that you learned about
very early on in this course why don't
we take a look at this middle one just
as an example as we discussed earlier
the first thing that I did was switch
from calling this G of X to calling it
why just so that when we're moving
things around it's easy to tell what
that variable actually is you won't get
it confused of anything then to change
from the original function to the
inverse I just switch the spots of x and
y so instead of y equals one quarter
times X minus 9 we have x equals one
quarter times y minus nine from there I
multiply both sides by 4 and then add a
9 to both sides to get Y by itself since
I want G inverse of X on the left side
of the equation since that's our
standard function notation I just took
one extra step to switch the sides of
the equation so that y was on the left
instead of on the right that gave us a
final answer of G inverse of x equals 4x
plus 9 the other two answers we ended up
with where F inverse of x equals x minus
1 and H inverse of x equals the cube
root of x now instead of writing cube
root X you could of course have written
X to the one-third power instead either
way is correct help this extra practice
with inverse functions helped you feel a
bit more comfortable with the process we
have to go through for finding them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
