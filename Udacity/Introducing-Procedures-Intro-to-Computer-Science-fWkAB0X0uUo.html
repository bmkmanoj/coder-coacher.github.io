procedure and a procedure is something
that takes inputs in there can be more
than one does some work on those inputs
and produces outputs as results and the
idea of a procedure is a very powerful
idea this allows us to use a small
amount of code to do many different
things we can have the same code operate
on different inputs whatever we pass in
as inputs to the procedure will be what
that code operates on and it can do
different things depending on those
inputs and it produces outputs that tell
us the result based on the inputs that
we passed in you've seen things very
similar to procedures in the previous
unit you saw the built-in operators
operators like + + took two numbers as
its inputs and as its output it produced
the sum of those two numbers because
it's a built in operator it's a little
different from a procedure the syntax
that we use for it is different because
it's a built-in operator but in terms of
being something that abstractly operates
on different inputs and produces the
corresponding output it's very much the
same idea what we're gonna learn in this
unit is how to make our own procedures
Python provides a construct for doing
that and the grammar is to have the
keyword death that's short for define
followed by a name and the name of
procedures just like the name of a
variable can be any string that starts
with a letter can be followed by letters
and numbers and underscores anything
that we could use as a variable we can
use as the name of a procedure then
there's a left paren the left paren is
very important that's what makes it a
procedure and after the left paren we
have a list of parameters and parameters
is just a fancy name for the inputs to
the procedure after that there's a colon
this is what says we're making a
procedure it has this name it takes
these inputs then what we have to do is
actually define the code and so what
follows that is a block and a block is
just a sequence of statements the code
that we want to run as the body of the
procedure what the inputs are is just a
list of
separated by commas we can have as many
inputs as we want
there could be no inputs in that case
what the parameters would look like is
just two parens with nothing between
them
there could be one input in that case
we'd have a paren followed by a name
followed by a close friend or there
could be many inputs in which case we'd
have a paren followed by the name of the
first input followed by the name of the
second input followed by the name of the
third followed by as many inputs as we
want so we could have five inputs give
them the names a b c d e this is not a
good idea usually to give our parameters
meaningless names that makes it hard to
remember what they are when we use them
in the code that we write is the block
we're much better off having parameters
with names like page they remind us what
they mean the body of the procedure is
the block this is the code that runs to
execute the procedure the block is
indented inside the definition usually
we like to use for spaces that's just
the convention in Python and that makes
it easy for people to see and read the
code but all the lines in the block have
to be indented the same amount and
that's how the interpreter knows that
we've got to the end of the procedure
when we get to some code that's not
indented anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
