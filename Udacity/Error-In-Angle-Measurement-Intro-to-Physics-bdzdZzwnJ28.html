sun's rays being vertical in CNN well
that's not entirely true and the way we
made the calculation that's about a
twenty percent error we saw it was
sixteen percent on one side and twenty
four percent on the other so I'm just
gonna say it's about twenty percent
we're just trying to get a big picture
idea of where our air is coming from
here what about measuring the angle of
the sun's rays in Alexandria how much
error would we get from this measurement
well let's think about how we did the
calculation we put a vertical rod up
right in Alexandria and allowed the Sun
to shine on it which caused a shadow
down here by measuring the length of the
shadow and the length of this rod we
could calculate this angle which we call
alpha so the only real place for error
in this calculation well there's three
places for in this calculation the first
is making sure the rod is vertical by
simply hanging away from a string you
can assure that something is vertical
because you know that weight will always
point straight down straight to the
center of the earth so this wasn't
really something to worry about the next
comes from measuring the broad itself
measuring the length of the rod now we
know that nothing can be measured to
exact precision but they had pretty good
measuring devices even 2,000 years ago
so I don't think there's much air
introduced in measuring the length of
this rod and I think we can safely say
it's negligible and not worry about it
finally we have measuring the length of
the shadow and now when you try to do
this experiment at home and that will be
one of the homework assignments we're
all one and collect this data together
you'll find that measuring a shadow
length isn't completely trivial
in fact shadows are a little fuzzy it's
hard to tell where they begin and where
they end so actually there is some error
here let's say it's about equal to I
don't know one centimeter which is one
hundredth of a meter now if we're
talking about a shadow whose length is
100 centimeters that would be a 1
percent error 1 centimeter is 1 percent
of 100 I want to know how can we best
reduce the percentage error with the
measurement of the shadow should we make
the measurement many times she
use a really really big rod or should we
use many rods of varying lengths which
of these would best reduce the percent
error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
