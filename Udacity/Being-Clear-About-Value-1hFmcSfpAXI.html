paying real money for in-game currency
99 cents will get you three thousand of
gold 499 gets you 18,000 and so on and
you can see this bonus listed underneath
the higher-priced items and this is a
great example of being clear about value
the bonus markers make it obvious that
there's a specific benefit for buying
different higher price items in the
store and the user doesn't have to do
any math for example I already know that
the 499 option compared to the 99-cent
one will give me twenty percent more
gold than I would have gotten had I gone
for the cheaper option the store layout
is also very clear they're only selling
one item gold the in-game currency so
the store isn't crowded with too many
options let's look at another example of
a store that could be improved it has a
good layout but I'm not immediately sure
why I should buy a higher price item and
the store is mixing in-game currency and
items for sale there's too much variety
this example is not as clear as our last
one and I'd be less likely to buy
higher-priced items or really anything
in this store so make sure to show what
kind of value a player will be getting
by buying your in-app items it's
important to have a nice layout and most
importantly be clear about value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
