defined as the amount of math per memory
or to be a little more precise the
amount of useful work which is
essentially math operations that we do
for the amount of time that we spend
doing memory accesses so we want to
maximize arithmetic intensity not
minimize it spending less time on memory
operations clearly helps and the single
most important way that you can do that
is to coalesce your global memory
accesses now doing fewer memory
operations per thread well this may may
or may not help ok for example we might
want to move data into the fast shared
memory do some operations on it there
and then move it back and that would be
more total memory operations but the
overall time spent on accessing memory
would go down because we're doing a lot
of frequent accesses within shared
memory so this one's not correct
necessarily by the same token we don't
necessarily want to move all data to
shared memory right because that could
be an unnecessary memory operation what
we really care about is moving
frequently accessed data to shared
memory so these three are not correct
finally the GPU does run most
efficiently when adjacent threads take
the same path through the code that
means it's good to avoid thread
divergence in this unit we'll give a lot
more explanation examples and specifics
for all three of these general
guidelines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
