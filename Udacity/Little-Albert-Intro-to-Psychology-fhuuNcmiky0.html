conditioning is the little Albert study
John me Watson in 1920 wanted to see if
we could classically conditioned a fear
or a phobia so he used a nine month old
baby they called little Albert he let
little Albert play with a white rat and
Albert loved this rat he wasn't scared
of him at all but then Watson would hit
a steel pipe with a hammer to create
this loud bang and that would really
scare Albert it would make him cry and
feel really fearful and eventually after
several pairings of this loud bang while
Albert played with the white rat Albert
began to fear the rat so the rat became
the conditioned stimulus in the cry in
the fear Albert experienced was a
conditioned response so it's sad the
little Albert no longer liked the white
rat that he used to like but here's the
thing it gets worse Albert started to
fear things that were similar to the rat
this is called generalization Albert
generalized his fear to other furry
things such as bunnies dogs even Watson
himself when he wore a rabbit mask but
the mass was pretty creepy so I don't
blame him now it actually gets worse
Watson never extinguished this fear so
Albert had it throughout his whole life
there's contradicting reports and what
actually happened to Albert after the
study from he was a well-adjusted adult
he died at a young age where he lived
his life with an extreme phobia of all
furry things but we just don't know so
we really don't want this to happen to
Greg and have him be scared of a bell
his whole life so we need to extinguish
this fear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
