perspective on AI problems by looking at
how Sebastian Thrun describes them in
his artificial intelligence class at
Udacity and when a brief you talk of AI
as something else which is e AI is the
technique of uncertainty management in
computer software put differently AI is
the discipline that you apply when you
want to know what to do when you don't
know what to do now there's many reasons
why they might be uncertainty in a
computer program there could be a sensor
limit that is your sensors are unable to
tell me what exactly is the case outside
the AI system there could be adversaries
who act in a way that makes it hard for
you to understand what is the case there
could be stochastic environments every
time you roll the dice in a dice game
these stochasticity of the diocese will
make it important and impossible for you
to be absolute certain about the
situation there could be laziness so
perhaps you can actually compute but the
situation is but your computer program
is just too lazy to do it and here's my
favorite ignorance plain ignorance many
people just ignorant what's going on
they could know it but it just don't
care all of these things are cause for
uncertainty AI is the discipline that
deals with uncertainty and manages it in
decision-making what's interesting here
is that Sebastian's description suggests
that AI is specifically about dealing
with uncertainty in to a large extent
that's exactly what artificial
intelligence and machine learning are
about designing programs that can deal
with uncertain input now let's go back
to our course and talk about what AI
problems actually are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
