from the nsobject class so unlike and
Swift it's not always necessary to
implement a custom initializer if i go
into the main function of our house
project i can initialize an instance of
the house class with no problem you've
seen this a few times now every time you
create an object you type Alec which
allocate some memory space and then it
to initialize the object instance Alec
and it always written together they're
like entangled particles they can't be
separated
that being said this house I initialized
has no address so i think we should
write a custom initializer will write
our custom initializer in the house dot
m-file this is the first method were
riding together so let's take a minute
to talk about the syntax of method
definitions every method definition
starts with a return type in this case
our return type is going to be instance
type instance type indicates an instance
of the class in which this method is
found in this case an instance of the
house class after the return type will
type in it
no surprise there but generally you're
going to want to initialize an instance
of a class with some values so it's
common to name your initializer in it
with some property in our case will
admit with address and then we place a
colon after the method named after the
colon we pass in our parameter address
and of course address is going to be a
pointer to a string we indicate the
parameter type here in between
parentheses and include an Asterix to
show that the parameter is a pointer to
an object after the parameter type comes
the perimeter itself address and then
some curly braces to hold the body of
the method so the general form for
writing a method definition looks like
this the return type between parentheses
the method name followed by a colon the
parameter type between parentheses if
the parameter is an object included
astrix the parameter name and then in
between curly braces the body of the
method now let's get back to
initialization every init method is
going to start out by calling the init
method of its superclass which in this
case is nsobject so we set itself equal
to super init next we want to check that
everything
and went well with that called super
init so we type if self self should have
a value now so this statement should
evaluate to true then in the body of
this if statement will initialize our
properties i place an underscore here
before address and this is how I access
the address instance variable directly
remember that address is marked with the
attribute copy so we want to initialize
it with a copy of the string that's
being passed in this line protects the
address from the unintentional changes
we talked about earlier so again we set
underscore dress equal to a copy of
address the parameter being passed in
will give these other properties default
values
let's say the default number of bedrooms
is too and the default value of has hot
tub is false
when we're done setting the values of
the properties we return self</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
