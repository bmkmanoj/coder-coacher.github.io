unfortunate single fail point the name
node the name known machine crashed or
became unreachable the metadata about
the blocks would be lost but if you have
a stamp by name node that is
synchronized with the active name node
the standby can take over this is called
high availability mode and Bari provides
a wizard to lead you through enabling
high availability all right now it is
time to configure high availability go
to services HDFS summary click on
service Actions menu then choose enable
name node H a name this guy anything you
want let's just do my cluster so here
you can choose which hosts you want to
be running the drill node name node and
whatnot I have this set up as a data
node these guys are only running one
service each so I'll put them here so
now we have three hosts not ready master
services that means those are the data
nodes now the wizard will lead you
through the process it's pretty simple
but a few times it'll prompt you to log
in to the name nodes with their internal
host names however you'll need to use
the public host names since you aren't
in the network with your ec2 instances
all right now we see stand by name node
and an active name node this cluster is
now running in high availability mode if
this name no dies this one can take over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
