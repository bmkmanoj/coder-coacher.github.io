active node transfer system took a
different approach to show the utility
of the vision since modifying the
protocol stack is non-trivial instead
the ants toolkit is really an
application-level package and this
toolkit is available for the application
programmer to say here is my payload and
here is my quality of service
constraints and what the ants toolkit
does is to create an ant's header to
this payload so the new payload looks
like this and this is what is called a
capsule and the capsule consists of an
ant's header and the actual payload and
this is what is given to a normal
operating system protocol stack and so
this normal operating system protocol
stack looks like this as the payload
that has been given to it and it knows
the destination address where this has
to go so sticks on the IP header for it
so the new packet that is generated by
the protocol stack looks like this it
has the IP header and the rest of it is
payload so long as this protocol stack
is concerned but we know that this
payload consists of two parts one is the
normal payload that the application
generated and in addition to that there
is the ants header that has been slapped
on by the ants toolkit and this is what
Traverse is a network and when it
traverses a network if a node in the
network is a normal node meaning it is
not a smart node but it is a normal IP
router then it simply uses the IP header
to say well here is what I have to do in
terms of sending the packet to the next
hop towards the destination on the other
hand if a node that receives this packet
is an active node then it can actually
process this ants header and say oh this
particular packet needs to be
demultiplexed and sent to two different
routes and it might take that
intelligent routing decision based on
the nature of that node so that's the
idea that we can push one of the pain
points out of the operating system into
an ant's toolkit that lives above the
operating system so that's sort of the
ants toolkit vision that's one part now
the second part and of course the fact
that the internet may not be 0
to opening up all the routers to to be
processing the specialized code that
comes in the capsule so what we do is we
keep the active nodes only at the edge
of the network in other words the core
IP network is unchanged and all of the
magic happens only at the edge of the
network so once again if I go back to my
example of sending greetings to my
siblings then only the edge nodes have
to do the magic in order to take my
original message and process the code to
deliver it to multiple destinations so
the rest of the network can remain
unchanged so the code of the IP network
can can be unchanged and intelligence
can be at the edge of the network so
this is sort of allowing sort of
marrying this active network vision with
the core IP network being unchanged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
