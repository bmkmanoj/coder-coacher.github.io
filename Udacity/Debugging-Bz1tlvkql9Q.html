any errors looks like I forgot braces
here for DQ so I'm calling that method
correctly now so now I'm just going to
go ahead and go through my test cases
that i mentioned before i'm just going
to put them in this little box here and
we had our none all right empty brackets
so we go for these is return 0
immediately sets working and what about
when we actually have a working test
case like it was through most of this
code here okay so i go through set
islands 20 checking the length so this
would be set to 3 and this would be to
going through going through every
element so I fired first find my first
one I'm incrementing my island count so
now that's going to be equal to 1 and go
to my fine parts of violent method here
creating my cue pending those values and
then i have my breadth first search here
that I'm going through and so for this
instance there's no once the right or on
the bottom of it so I wouldn't have to
do this and then I go to next one it's
not 0 so we don't do anything we just go
through the loop one okay so i'm going
to increment my islands account again
this is now going to be too and let's
not go through that and then i found my
person island so there actually are ones
here so i'm going to go ahead and add
those then i add those there and that
looks all good so this one so it
actually gets its to there this is going
to get set to 2 and now i'm adding both
of these the queue to look at them and
I'm not pending any the stuff around i'm
only pending that to the queue so don't
looking through there there's nothing
else and so basically I'm just going to
be sitting these 22
and that's and then I'd probably just
visit every element in the array there's
no more wines so that would be in of it
but oh it looks like I forgot to return
the number of islands here so looks like
it works well it looks like all of his
code worked not only is this fellow
handsome but he sure is intelligent the
debugging process is often overlooked
but a very important part of the
algorithm interview not only does this
show the interviewer that the candidate
checks their code it may even help the
candidate find mistakes that they missed
the first time they were coding their
solution it's easy to miss a semicolon
here and there if a candidate we're
coding in some language like Java or
forget to return a result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
