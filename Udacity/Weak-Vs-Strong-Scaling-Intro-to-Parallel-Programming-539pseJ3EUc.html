it is you're trying to accomplish by
parallelizing the code say you have a
serial program that solves a certain
problem size P and time T you know maybe
you're simulating how a certain protein
molecule folds and that simulation takes
an hour to run weak scaling is what we
refer to when we're talking about using
parallel computing to run a larger
problem or perhaps to run more problems
so if you wanted to run a bigger protein
if you wanted to fold a bigger protein
in your simulation and still take an
hour or if you wanted to fold many small
proteins in the same hour then that
would be an example of weak scaling
strong scaling means using parallel
computing to run a problem faster a
single problem size so if you wanted to
fold that same protein that you were
folding in an hour and you wanted to
fold it in a minute then that would be
an example of strong scaling more
formally we could say that weak scaling
describes how the solution size varies
with a fixed problem size per processor
as you add processors we would say that
strong scaling describes how the
solution size varies as you add
processors to tackle a fixed total
problem size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
