the pattern continues to repeat itself
to find any power by we simply divide
the power of i by 4 and look at the
remainder the remainder will I would be
0 1 2 or 3 and will determine the power
of I for example I to the 12th we would
take the power of 12 and divided by four
we know 12 / 4 equals 3 with a remainder
of 0 this remainder becomes the new
power for I so we know I to the 12th is
really equivalent to I to the 0 and
anything to the 0 power equals 1 this
should also make sense since I to the
12th can be written as I to the 4th
times I to the 4th times I to the fourth
this means we really have I to the 4th
repeated a bunch of times or really just
the multiplication a positive one it's
easiest to simplify any power of i by
dividing the power by four and looking
at the remainder this will be our new
power of i once we have our power of i
we look back to see what it would equal
in this case we don't need to since we
have I to the zero and anything raised
to the zero power equals one we know our
pattern repeats every four so if we work
backwards with our pattern we know I 20
would equal positive one so this should
definitely make sense with our pattern
so if i wanted to simplify I to the 39th
I would do 39 / 4 we know this is nine
remainder 3 this is what I'm interested
in the remainder so I know I did 39th is
really equal to I to the third power we
would have cycled through this pattern
of 49 times and then ended up with i
cubed we know i cubed is really equal to
negative i so this power simplifies to
negative i if i want to simplify I to
the 50th I would divide 50 x for which
is 12 remainder 2 so I know I to the
50th is really equal to i squared or
negative 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
