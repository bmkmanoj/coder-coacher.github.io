print statement is not executing what's
going on well the problem is the nsurl
session doesn't directly run tasks for
us instead it gives us methods to create
tasks but then we're responsible for
starting them ourselves now this may
seem tedious but it actually gives us
much more flexibility for starting
stopping and resuming tasks to start the
task we just need to call the resume
method on the task itself now let's run
this there we go now that's the print
statement we were expecting the next
step will be to take the data that's in
the completion Handler and create an
image that we can display to the user
let's look at apples documentation for
the data task with URL completion
handler method in the discussion section
there's this one really important blurb
that I want to focus on it says if the
requests complete successfully the data
parameter of the completion Handler
block contains the resource data and the
air parameters nil but if the request
fails the data parameter is nil and the
error parameter contains information
about the failure so back in the code we
can use this information to our
advantage and check first to see if the
error is nil as long as the error is nil
then our data should be good to use now
how can we take our data which is in the
form of an NS data object and turn it
into an image that we can display
actually it's quite easy the UI image
class has a handy initializer that can
construct an image directly from NS data
so we'll use it to create an image and
then we'll set the image views image
property to our downloaded image
this looks great let's run it and see if
it works well something's wrong again
we're not getting our image let me try
something else since I have a little
experience dealing with these kind of
problems in the simulator I'm going to
simulate hitting the home button the
hotkey for this is command shift H there
we go or you can select it from the
simulators toolbar here at the top there
it is home button this takes us out of
the app now let's reopen it there's our
image
how come I didn't show up at first let's
investigate this problem next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
