analysis and I estimated what the user
bases out there and kind of what the
catch opportunity is and I kind of say
things are looking pretty good now there
are a couple of other competitors of the
space but if we focus on things like the
real time update nature of the app and
the collaborative nature of the app I
think I think we really have the runway
to make this idea take off great so you
mentioned some initial wire frames for
the app yeah i think we'll want to
divide this in two stages we can call
these versions and release the app to
testers accordingly version 0.1 is where
we'll decide what kind of stack we're
going to use once we've done that we'll
take the Minimum Viable Product also
known as the simplest version of the app
that version will be focused on writing
and reading one piece of data from the
online data store that we just set up
sounds good and then in version 0.2 you
could build out the other screens create
the bulk of the data that gets stored in
the database and decide how to visualize
it and connect it to the database we're
going to need to add user authentication
at some point that could be for version
0.3 you could add a sign in and create
account screen to the app that will
allow for authentication and user
accounts that sounds good and then the
0.4 release we can cover how to use all
the user data that we just grabbed to
allow for sharing user lists also since
we're accumulating all that data will
probably want some way to sort and
filter it oh and you'll need to address
security and permissions at some point
you don't want to have your data just
lying around for anyone to access maybe
that shopping list plus plus 0.5 or
maybe that's one dot oh okay so it looks
like we have a pretty good road map of
the app sketched out but I'll keep
checking in with you both to make sure
that we're on track</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
