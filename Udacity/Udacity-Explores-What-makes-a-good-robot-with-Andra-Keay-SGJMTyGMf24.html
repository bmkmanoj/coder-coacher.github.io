I what do you consider in your opinion
what makes a good robot that interacts
with the human I think that one of the
key things is don't over specialize
don't over a dorm don't make your robot
really promise more than it's going to
be able to deliver because I think we
still have very very rudimentary
abilities to behave appropriately in
context and as long as you can't really
rely on a robot to know enough about a
situation to have anything approaching a
human level of response then creating
something that gives us the expectation
is going to you know it's going to turn
around and bite us because people will
be disappointed in that robot and we're
at a weird point right now where there
are a lot of claims so it's probably
easier to sell a robot if you make a lot
of promises about what it can do and
people love the idea of robots that they
can have some sort of relationship in a
very broad sense
companionship it's cute something like
that but it makes it easier to sell the
robot but we haven't really had enough
robots out there for people to start to
see how well they remain engaged and I
think most good robotics companies are
actually less concerned with selling the
robot and more concerned with building
something that is going to keep
engagement once it has been so once it's
in someone's house how do you keep
people interacting with it so it's an
interesting idea talking about the
engagement level of a robot do you feel
that there's certain types of robots
that warrant a higher level of
engagement and like a stronger bond
between people so for instance you know
government contractors I used to work in
ground control stations for UAVs and
things like that but I read an article
that one of the soldiers had at UAB that
he flew
a bunch of different missions in
Afghanistan or Iraq and it was I think
50 missions or something like that and
it got shot down finally and when it got
shot down
the soldier demanded a burial for his
UAV and they were like what's just a
robot he's like this thing has saved my
life so many times you know with all of
the landmines IDs and everything else on
there he's like I want this thing buried
I want to have a proper send-off for it
you think you're going to see that kind
of reaction for more people kind of
going forward in the future with like
social robots or home robots or do you
think it's just going to be kind of one
of those it's kind of a cool thing I
interact with it a little bit but then
after a while that kind of like this new
and shiny missive it kind of wears off
and we actually go back to treating me
more like a machine I think it really
depends on the depth of the interaction
and you've talked about what's really an
extreme use case it's been engaged in
life-and-death situations so you will
have a very strong bond if it's
vacuuming your floors you want and one
of the points that has been raised that
I think was very interesting was to
suggest that up until this moment in
time humans really had only a couple of
ontological states that we could
comprehend one was alive and one was
dead or inanimate so you were either an
object or you were an organism and it's
saying so do we then get into a kind of
shit side state of having things that
behave or that we treat like organisms
that then behave like objects and do we
then treat them like objects or do we
carry over that more emotional response
and what does that mean in terms of us
developing perhaps empathy is one of the
biggest worries that people have if
we're engaging with something that looks
like it's alive but we can treat it
badly
is this going to create a lack of
empathy in us one of the interesting
hypotheses is
we're going to evolve towards a third
ontological awareness that there are
some things that are both alive and not
alive that they can be emotionally
engaging that they can be turned off and
on at will without damage so if we can
really develop that third ontological
awareness then perhaps there's not an
issue with us being trained into a lack
of empathy because we all understand its
exact thing as opposed to an it or a you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
