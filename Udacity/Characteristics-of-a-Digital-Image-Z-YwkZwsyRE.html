and I start looking at these images and
start seeing what are the numeric values
at each and every pixel and what in
different ways what representation do
they have and how can we actually start
doing any simple types of computations
on it
here I'm showing a simple image of the
manual image the original image here and
to help us kind of look into it I'm
gonna actually start zooming into it
very closely and start showing you
exactly the details that actually would
be seen if you were actually that close
up to that image but also start showing
you the numerical values associated with
an image like this so here you note I've
actually put a small red box inside this
image this is a small red box about 8
pixels by 8 pixels or something like
that again I'm showing you two spec
toriel representations of it look at it
more as a exercise of looking at how and
these types of images what kind of
information we have in these images less
at the exact values this is just now me
showing a zoomed in version where the
red region is now in the next one I'll
show you exactly what the red region
looks like namely this one now if you
notice here there is a lot of white area
and a little bit of a grayish area and a
kind of a dividing line between them
which is kind of where you would see the
details of this and you can see there's
a much more close-up here now of course
what you also should be seeing if the
your display supports it a little bit of
blockiness
at each and every pixels began because
these are pixels that we have zoomed in
and gotten really close to if I had some
magic and of course I do when I actually
look at it computationally I would been
able to look at this image and actually
not just look at the image but the
values that exist at each and every
pixel let me zoom in to exactly the
level of the red pixel region that we
have and now if you notice you should be
seeing some numbers and you'll notice
the numbers are like 159 168 and then
lower numbers of 131 132 here and
approximately there is a little bit of a
you know the same kind of thing here
where white values and a little bit of
more gray values now again this is just
simply a pictorial way of looking at it
these numbers are not exact even though
I have attempt
to match it as closely as possible to
this sub image here a couple of things
we can start doing now and that is
started looking at this image a little
bit more carefully and see if it we can
learn about different intensities in
different directions so here what I've
done is I've actually now drawn a line
basically what I've done is a membrane
these are different columns and in this
way are different rows I found one row
I've drawn this and I've actually drawn
a plot of the values at that slice and
if you now traverse it I'm gonna start
kind of moving in from this way and if
you notice there are lots of darker
values of course there is a lot of
change going on and all of a sudden when
you come up here there's a lot more
higher values remember that lower values
kind of designate more of the darker
shades of gray or black and the brighter
values much more lighter shades of gray
towards white so white comes in and here
again you see a little bit of change now
this actually starts selling us a lot
more about this image just for that one
slice I also wanted to show that the
same slicing can be done in the Y axes
so here for example you've looked at the
one row just one row and if you look at
it again the same kind of stuff if you
come in from the top there's a lot of
kind of varies dark values all of a
sudden we see a lot more white values
and again coming down to a lot more gray
values so this basically now starts
saying is we can start looking at these
numbers even though the image is shown
to us in this form or this form there
are underneath that these values and
these are extremely important values for
us and we can actually kind of start
doing where as types of visualizations
of this and these basically are just
looking at the slices so looking at this
now you should be seeing that basically
we've kind of looked at an image being
able to visualize it in X&amp;amp;Y slices this
should start suggesting and specially
looking at this is basically this is a
two-dimensional representation where
each and every point is basically a
pixel which has its own intensity value
so the best way to represent this would
be a matrix this already kind of looks
like a matrix it's a two-dimensional
array and each and every element of this
Ricks is a pixel and the value of that
is basically the intensity value there
so in which can be therefore represented
as a matrix and the variance of all the
where the values vary from zero which is
for black to 255 which is white so this
is a scale that goes from 255 to zero
european pure black that is no pixel is
actually now showing any intensity
whatsoever and white where the entire
pixel is basically showing the maximum
intensity that is pure white of course
anywhere in between would be different
shades of gray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
