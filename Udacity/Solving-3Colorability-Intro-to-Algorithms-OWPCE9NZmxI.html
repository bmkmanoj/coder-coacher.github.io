algorithm works first I make sure that
the that we have a mapping from all of
the nodes of the graph - I didn't check
everything well here's what I checked
make sure that the number of nodes in
the coloring matches the number of notes
in the graph if not then this is not a
good coloring and then for each node in
the coloring list well if it's the case
that the coloring for the node is not a
valley color then we say that's bad and
then we check all the neighbors of the
node and we check for each combination
of node and its neighbor whether the
colorings match and if any of the
colorings match that's bad because that
means we have two adjacent regions with
the same color so we return false and if
we survive all of those tests then at
the end of the day we return true
the thing that I didn't check for that I
probably should have checked for is to
make sure that the nodes that are in use
in the certificate are the same as the
nodes that are in use in the graph so
that would be kind of weird or if it has
nodes that aren't in the graph then this
will actually crash which is not good so
it probably should have check for that
but but this is the essence of it is
just this that we're running through all
the edges in the graph and making sure
that the colors don't match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
