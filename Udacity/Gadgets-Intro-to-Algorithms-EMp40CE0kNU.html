constraints so that this truth
assignment has to be satisfying and to
do that we're going to introduce a set
of nodes for each clause that is
sometimes referred to as a gadget these
gadgets come up a lot in np-completeness
proofs they're it's in this case it's
going to be a little piece of a graph
but it's going to be a little piece of a
graph that has particular mechanics to
it that makes the graph act like a
three-set problem all right now we're
going to extend this graph by adding a
gadget for each Clause
now gadget is just going to be a little
chunk of a graph but it's going to have
very particular property to it that it's
going to be 3 colorable in the context
of the rest of the graph if and only if
the corresponding Clause is satisfiable
in the context of the assignment so
let's imagine that we've got this is our
Clause l1 l2 l3 all right so there's a
couple different ways of making this
gadget here's one that makes sense to me
essentially this is going to be little
triangles the kind of art correspond to
or expressions and the or of l1 and l2
board with l3 is going to give us the
answer for the clause so so here's the
six node they're going to be connected
to some of the nodes that are already in
the graph in particular the three
literals that are in the clause and the
slack variable in the middle slack node
in the middle and the false node off to
the side and just to simplify things
remind you that the false node is
colored black the slack node is colored
red and these literal nodes are either
going to be blue or black each one and
now what I'd like to do is show you that
the different ways of coloring these
either allow the rest of this structure
to be colored with three colors or not
so let's start off with the case where
all three of the literals are false
that's an important case because if all
if the assignment is such that the
literals are all false then it's not
satisfied this Clause is not satisfied
so the whole formula is not satisfied so
this is going to be important to make
sure that this graph is not going to be
colorable
so given that these two nodes are
connected to slack neither of them can
be read so this one in particular can
either be blue or black if this one's
colored blue then that means neither of
these can be colored blue and neither of
these can be colored black so they have
to be colored both colored red and that
doesn't work so this can't be blue and
it can't be red so it has to be black
these can either be blue or red it
doesn't matter which is which all right
so now we have this node oh well this
node is kind of obvious it's connected
to red and black so it has to be blue
now this node is connected to blue and
black so it has to be red and this node
is connected to red blue and black so we
are in trouble
so the graph was not colorable when
these three literals are all black what
if this literal is blue well that means
that one of the literals in the clause
is true so the whole Clause should be
true so this better be colorable okay by
the same argument before this is red and
black so this one has to be blue as well
so it looks like we're okay we're able
to assign colors to all these nodes so
that none of the coloring constraints
are violated so that's okay so if this
one is blue and these guys are black
actually this one doesn't matter what it
is but the thing is colorable what if
this one were so this could either be
blue or black what if this one were blue
well that's going to be okay too
we can just swap the two colors of these
nodes all right so what that means is if
this one is blue the thing is colorable
definitely so one of them is true that's
it this one is true that's enough so
let's consider the case where this one's
black and one of the other guys is blue
all right so this one's forced to be
blue since this one's black and this
one's blue this one's forced to be red
which means this one's forced to be
black which means this one's forced to
be blue now we're in good shape because
this one's black and this one's red and
now we have a valid coloring actually no
matter what the hell - is coloured and
the same argument works if we switch
which which one of these two is blue we
can just swap these two colors and
everything's fine so what did we just
show so this gadget for this clause is
colorable as long as the three literals
it's connected to our
all black and that's great because
that's exactly what the satisfiability
condition is so we create one of these
gadgets for each of the clauses connect
them to the rest of the graph and now we
get this giant graph and that whole
graph is satisfied if only if and only
if all the gadgets can be colored which
is the same as saying if only if and
only if all the clauses can be satisfied
and since they're all connected with an
x' that's exactly what we wanted it to
be so this graph that we've built is
colorable if and only if the entire
formula is satisfiable that's kind of
cool right so even though a formula with
boolean variables in it and a graph with
different colors in it feel like very
different problems than a very deep
fundamental mathematical way they're
really the same problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
