that we have to type a URL into the
browser every time you want to grab some
data from last mms API there has to be a
more efficient way to do this and you're
right we can write a simple Python
program that uses the JSON and requests
libraries to do exactly what we did
manually a few moments ago if we run
this program right here let's look at
what it returns look the data that this
Python program returned is exactly the
same JSON data that you saw in the
browser a second ago this program was
less than ten lines first we specify a
URL then we simply say requests that get
that URL and call dot txt in order to
get the text we assign that value to
data we print type of data which we saw
was unicode and we print data itself
which was the json object but if we go
back and look at the JSON object itself
we see that it's in this funky string
format that makes it very hard for us to
parse out the interesting information we
could write a regex to parse out what we
want but that can get pretty painful
really quickly the JSON library will
make interacting with JSON data as easy
as 1-2-3 let me show you how we've
modified our script ever so slightly
after initially assigning data we
reassign it we say data equals JSON
loads data what json dot loads does is
it interprets a string and assumes that
it's a json object by doing so we
convert the json data into a python
dictionary we'll see that when we print
type data once we convert the data into
a nicely structured dictionary we can
get the interesting bits out as if we're
simply accessing a dictionary for
example typing data artists let's see
what this script produces now as we can
see what we return here is that the type
of the object is a dictionary and then
we have a Python dictionary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
