concept of finding an aramas one of the
restrictions of the way we have talked
about panoramas so far has been that you
have to take a sequence of pictures
panning left to right and different
formats well that sounds a lot of
restrictive so what we want to be able
to do is kind of find these panoramas
from a collection of pictures and this
actually also has been studied basic
idea is that we want to be able to find
similar you know find images from and
run ransack and find the most similar
types of these patches and say okay
these two images are the most closest to
each other let's actually build a
panorama on this one similarly find
another region that might have you know
similarities and use that and keep going
that way and third one of course would
be again similar ones and in essence
what we do is we will use ransack and
other types of matching techniques we
can find images that are next to each
other and use that to form a panorama so
we don't have to really worry about
taking pictures in a sequence this was a
method proposed by a brown and love and
actually it's one of the papers I would
like you to look at on your own and use
that as a method trying to understand
how we can actually do this kind of
stuff with taking pictures that are not
actually just in sequence but it could
be taken in any order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
