has a width and height basically we want
to use this to give it a numeric
representation of this image in two
dimensions so we can actually be looking
for information in it in the X and the y
directions the best way to refer to this
would be a now a function I XY which is
a continuous function or if we have a
discrete we'd actually be able to refer
to this as I of I J so I J here would be
discrete indices which could be the
number of the rows and the columns that
we're trying to traverse this thing if
this was of course a continuous function
we would be looking for variables x and
y to be able to now extract any
information out of this image and of
course one more thing to add here is
then basically we try to take the
resolution of the image which is
represent in terms of width and height
as I showed in the last slide or
basically just showing here very quickly
as to an image basically is the scope of
this image is defined by the width of
the number of columns and the height of
the number of rows of this image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
