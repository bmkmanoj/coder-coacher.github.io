percentage IBD focuses on using this IBS
in a particular order on your
chromosomes it helps you determine which
piece which piece of the chromosome came
from from who and your family for
example let's think about the chromosome
pieces you inherited from your
grandparents here we have your
grandmother's chromosomes and your
grandfather's chromosomes now your
mother has her own set of chromosomes
she got half from her mother and half
from her father half from your
grandmother half from your grandfather
now when your mother's germ cells went
through meiosis to make eggs
recombination allowed our chromosomes to
mix and match the grand parental
chromosomes her parental chromosomes so
that when you inherited a set of
chromosomes from your mother you got
this interesting mix of your
grandparents now you could do the same
thing for your father and we can add up
how much each grandparent contributed to
each chromosome and you'll see that it's
roughly twenty-five percent right here
you have half of your chromosomes came
from mom and of those half you'll notice
that the blue segments represent about
half of that so total 25% came from each
grandparent if you and a grandparent
actually participated in a service like
23andme you can see exactly which
segments of the chromosomes you share
with the grandparent and the fact that
you're roughly twenty-five percent
related to each other although the
individual sizes and chunks of the
segments that you may share with the
grandparent can vary roughly speaking
you'll be about twenty five percent
related through IBD to a grandparent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
