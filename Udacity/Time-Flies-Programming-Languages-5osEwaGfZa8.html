programming languages and if we turn the
clock back to last time we were posed
the following question given a string s
like a web page or some embedded
JavaScript or any program and a formal
grammar describing our desired language
a formal grammar for HTML or JavaScript
we want to know if that string s is in
the language of G and to do this we use
two key techniques lexical analysis
which broke the string down into a
stream of tokens and syntactic analysis
or parsing which takes a string of
tokens and checks to see if they adhere
to if they conform to a context-free
grammar while we're on the subject of
time and grammars grammars that may
possibly be ambiguous let me introduce
you to a phrase that you may not have
run into yet in the phrase is time flies
like an arrow fruit flies like a banana
the ambiguity trick here is that time is
a noun and flies is a verb time flies
and like an arrow is the modification so
here I've got time flying you can tell
because it's got labels and those labels
are always to be trusted so you might
think based on parallel structure that
fruit is a noun and verb is flies so
here I've got a picture of an apple with
wings and they're flying in the manner
of a banana but in fact fruit flies is
the noun they're little insects that go
after fruit and this time like is the
verb fruit flies go after the banana
they enjoy the man ana is the sort of
ambiguity that we could run into in a
natural language like English we're
gonna have to deal with that same sort
of issue in programming languages like
JavaScript or Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
