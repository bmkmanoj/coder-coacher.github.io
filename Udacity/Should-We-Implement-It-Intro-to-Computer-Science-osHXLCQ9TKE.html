to this is no this code is already
fairly complex it's got two loops in it
lots of statements and it doesn't handle
lots of cases so let's think about the
cases that it doesn't handle it doesn't
handle the case where the initial days
are in the same month and it doesn't
handle that because we're adding all the
days in month one to the days and then
if day two was also in month one we're
going to add that we're going to get the
wrong answer we could handle this
maybe we subtract the difference between
the days we have a special case for that
maybe we need to do something different
with this loop to account for when the
months are the same but that's painful
we're going to need a new special case
add in one special case is okay there
are other cases it doesn't handle it
doesn't handle the case where month two
is before month one and this could
happen if the years are different it
would still be the case that the second
date is after the first date even though
the second month is before the first
month and this won't handle that
correctly the other thing it doesn't
handle quite correctly is counting days
in leap years this loop where we add the
days in your one we'd have to be careful
depending on whether February is
included based on what month where it
whether we should pay attention to the
days in year one or the days in year two
there's a lot of things that doesn't
handle we could definitely fix this code
to handle those and if you answered the
second answer I'd encourage you to try
and do that to try to turn this into a
correct working program and you should
be able to do that but our goal as
programmers should be to try to find a
simple solution first something this
complicated is very difficult to get
correct once you start handling lots of
special cases and I've seen lots of
discussions on the form of people who
tried to handle all of these special
cases it's really hard to get them all
right and it makes the code very
complicated so let's start by thinking
of a simpler way often the way humans
solve a problem is not the simplest way
because humans are lazy we want to find
shortcuts instead of doing things in a
real simple mechanical way under the
heading computers are not lazy doing
things in a simple mechanical way is
great for computers makes the program
easier right makes it more likely to be
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
