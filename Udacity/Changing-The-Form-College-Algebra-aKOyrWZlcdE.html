this multiplication by 5 to both the X
and the negative 2 since in
slope-intercept form y is all by itself
on the left side of the equation we're
going to need to move this negative 3
term out of the left side so we add 3 to
both sides since right now it's being
subtracted and we end up with a final
equation of y equals 5x minus 7 so this
equation in our earlier equation should
be equivalent or rather they should be
equations that graph exactly the same
line to make sure that this equation
fits the information that we use to
create the equation in point-slope form
let's see if the point we started out
with lies on this line we can already
tell but the slope of this line is 5 so
that gets rid of one of our criteria
let's check each side of this equation
then with the point 2 3 on the left hand
side we have Y and substituting in our
value for y we have three so the
left-hand side gives us three now what
about the right-hand side the expression
on the right-hand side of the equation
is 5x minus 7 let's see what that is
equivalent to when we plug in our point
so you substitute 2 in for X and for
this side of the equation we also end up
with three since our left hand side and
our right hand side match each other we
plug in our information we're good to go
we have confirmed that this equation
fits our information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
