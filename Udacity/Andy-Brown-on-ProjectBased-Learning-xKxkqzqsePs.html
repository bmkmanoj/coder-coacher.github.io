one of the people who heads up a lot of
our education initiatives here at
Udacity and in fact not long ago Andy
was kind of lead on transitioning a lot
of what we do at Udacity to a more
project-based approach to dance complete
a project as part of their experience
and learning different skills so thank
you so much for talking to me 2day Andy
about project-based learning yeah thanks
for doing this so the first thing I want
to ask I think this comes up a lot more
dealing with teachers who want to do a
project based approach but I very
stressful resources is that project
based learning at least in my opinion is
much more difficult to implement in the
classroom than some traditional road
construction they're just lecturing or
giving material straight away um is it
worth the extra effort and if so why yes
it's absolutely worth doing
project-based learning and now that
there's all sorts of all sorts of free
resources online there's a lot of a lot
of free time potentially for instructors
to be spending their time coming up with
and helping their students as they go
through these project activities there's
lots of great explanations lots of great
sort of static resources out there that
they're going to solve a lot of sort of
what am I going to say how am I going to
explain this topic and in fact that's to
me not the interesting part of the
teaching the interesting part of the
teaching is how am I going to Shepherd
this personal long as their brain
transforms and that's that's best done
through an authentic project so yes it's
totally worth it it is hard what's good
easier my ask but it's getting easier
yeah you know this is this is your job
if you signed up to eight inches yeah
exactly I think I've always had the idea
that you just referred to of basically
building a course around all these
awesome free materials that are
available online because there's so much
out there that wasn't out there before
and that led to this class which is an
entire class based largely around the
materials that are already free online
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
and represent things that have already
been presented very well let's just see
if we can leverage it and spend our time
all kind of the more student focused
mentoring and feedback I'm speaking of
feedback so one thing that's very
difficult i think in project-based
learning is assessment that when you
know i have a bunch of students who all
did the same math problem i know what
the correct answer is i know what the
steps are and it's very easy for me to
go through and say you screwed up step
two you screw up step 4 but so what when
you know yeah done that that's true and
but yeah assessment in projects
is it's more difficult isn't it it's
it's a little bit more open ended its it
is but it's getting more towards what
you actually want to be measuring so yes
it's very easy to measure my you know
some students ability to factor 10
polynomials correctly it's just not a
very interesting measurement every now
and then you'll find things that can be
assessed that way you know or really
it's very important to know these facts
before you can move on but I'm guessing
that if you as an educator ask yourself
what do I really want how do I want to
change my students with this learning
experience I'm crafting you'll find it's
it's really hard to put the phrase that
in terms of some multiple-choice
questions or anything like that and this
is especially a danger when you're doing
online project based learning because
multiple choice questions are by far the
easiest things to do online right wrong
you know tally up a score you have a
little green progress bar and it works
but that experience just isn't it's
never going to be even close to what you
can get if you if you try to do the
product project-based learning yeah
exactly and I think that we have many of
our courses not our courses but of
courses are currently available online
or built around these multi choice tests
but you have exactly that where
oftentimes have repeatability built into
them which is great because you learn
from your failures we get the problem is
wrong you before and learn but when you
have only a very small set of possible
answers what you're really learning is
that C isn't the answer to that question
you're not learning the deeper
understanding of what's going on there
but for a teacher who has dealing with
for example in our class possibly a
hundred different projects all of which
need feedback are there any strategies
to how to give feedback in such a way
that students can actually improve on it
while doing the project as opposed to
just finding out at the end that they
already failed yeah if you can bake
feedback into the nature of the project
itself so an example for an HTML for
building an HTML webpage let's say so if
you don't anything about programming
sorry but if you're building a web page
and I say hey build a web page that
looks like this and I give you a little
image that looks like a web page the
feedback is pretty natural the feedback
is like well it doesn't look like that
anymore you don't need the instructor to
come and tell you that the student knows
it and then if you can set up systems
systems of feedback within students
you'd be amazed at the things that can
happen when you do the terrifying thing
pingback as an instructor and just
letting your students you know screw up
and and sort of script together that can
be really amazing learning experience
there has to be some constraints placed
on that but you can do it really well so
yeah if you find yourself staying up to
four am frantically grading a hundred
projects it's probably not ideal and
you're probably killing yourself you're
probably not giving the best feedback to
your students that you could because
nobody could do that and just probably a
more creative solution that will be just
as good yeah it sounds like there are a
lot of ways we can go about that like
giving exemplars that you know you can
the student can it on their own compare
their assignment to some exemplars and
see where it's different where it's
similar maybe building in some automated
assessment through some artificial
intelligence not just the that question
was wrong but something a little bit
deeper about the real nature of learning
and then let the peers give them
feedback on it you know I think we often
learn best from people who are going
through the same struggles that we're
going through so but you mentioned doing
this in the context of web design I
think you're exactly right that we often
talk about project-based learning in the
context of computer science because
professionally what we do in computer
science is mostly projects but what
about some other fields that I'm like
accounting or nursing or anything
another field but other fields where
it's not necessarily as a project based
on what you actually do can project
based learning be used there or is there
something that can be done that kind of
perpetuates the same philosophical
underpinnings of project-based learning
I I think those fields are still
project-based actually I think I think
we've overloaded this word project and
computer programming project can be what
you call the thing you're working on on
the side list school web page your
building and project-based learning the
word project means something very
specific it means this is an authentic
task an extended task so more than it
won't be completed in a single day it's
it's sort of loosely defined so there's
room for creativity and I mean the nurse
who is monitoring my blood blood glucose
levels that's a--that's a project the
you know accountant who's doing my taxes
is hope if anyone wants to do
project-based learning and do my taxes
but that's the project right that's an
authentic thing like balancing the books
on this company that's enough
I think I think projects are there if
you can find them and if they're not a
computer's probably doing that job
already yeah that's true I thinks a lot
of sense that we you know in computer
science we talk about projects because
it's something where I create the idea I
implemented execute and I deliver it but
now you're exactly right that a project
can be anything you know ongoing it's
got some investment in it but doesn't
necessarily have to be completely open
to whatever the student wants to specify
so so this is an educational technology
class and so we're really looking for
the ways we can use technology to
enhance education maybe the learning
process or maybe education as a private
community so specifically on the
technology front or the things that
technology lets us do in project-based
learning that are difficult to do in
person let me start by saying the things
that technology tempts us to do that we
would never do in person and that's the
things like the radio button quizzes
this sort of like oh I know how to do a
project I'm gonna have ten you know
check box quizzes that I'll you know ask
about how much would you put in this box
of my tax return if you're doing the
account an example that's not authentic
nobody thinks it's authentic it's not
fun you don't it's it's not a good
project base learn it's it's a very like
superficial substitute and it's really
tempting to do because it's so much
easier than anything else the things
that that the internet give you i mean
the inner it gives you scale and it
gives you access so i mean you can see
the chance to have people from across
the country across the world working
together on on a task at any hour that's
pretty cool yeah but it's a lot of work
to set up and there's a lot of ways can
go wrong so I mean there's they're
straight offs for sure um but but still
it's it's a better way of learning if
you can if you can find a way to make it
work yeah makes sense I think the
technology gives us a lot of ways to
exactly exactly what you're saying make
a little bit more open that if it's not
necessarily something that has to happen
within the confines of the one-hour
lecture that we have set aside for this
class three days a week it's something
that can happen you know at three
o'clock in the morning when I just
happen to be online the student asked
the question or there's you know project
to review and I can watch their progress
live which I really have difficulty
doing in person at Georgia Tech we
actually have some classes that have
tried to implement that approach where
students will come to a lab and there's
no lectures or anything like that
there's a set-aside class time that
they're expected to be there and the
idea is that their work on your project
and someone will be in the room to give
you feedback but that's a pretty big
pragmatic constraint if they have nine
hours a week where that required to be
in the studio working on the project
during that time and now we also have a
person who has to be there during that
time whereas the Internet allows us to
do that a little bit more asynchronously
because it kind of makes the classroom
unlocked 24-7 yes no so you have any
final thoughts for our students who are
both engaging in project-based learning
in this class and may also be trying to
develop tools that facilitate
project-based learning yeah well if
you're going through this class which is
itself an example of project-based
learning reflect on what's what's going
well and what's not there's there's
learning to be done just just in that
when you go on to try to do
project-based learning in your own
classroom your it's hard you're not
going to get it right to begin with
it'll probably the bad version will
still probably be better than if you
hadn't tried but there's going to be a
lot of things that are you're gonna it's
going to feel chaotic and sort of out of
control out of control really out of
your control and that sort of the nature
of project-based learning how is the
students gain more autonomy which is a
lot of the reason why we do it so stay
reflective next year will be better and
the next year will be better than that
and this is how we improve at our craft
this is how I justify what I said to
getting in this course which is that
there are some things will do in this
course that will fail miserably see now
I have an expert saying that that's okay
so I thank you so much for talking to us
today handy and anything for your
perspective and thank y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
