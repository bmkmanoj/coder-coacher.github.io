learned about dependent samples or
repeated measures just to refresh your
memory that could be where we give the
same person to different conditions to
see how they react to each one maybe a
control and then a treatment or maybe
two types of treatments or this could be
longitudinal where we measure some
variable at one point in time and then
again at another and see if the variable
changes or this could be a pretest and
then post-test what was the measurement
of a variable before and after a
treatment these are just a few
situations in which we would use
dependent samples this type of research
design is really useful because it
controls for individual differences in
other words if we gave someone some kind
of treatment then those same individual
differences will be present the next
time we give that same treatment that
way we can see how two different
treatments play out under the same
conditions because as controls for
individual differences we can then use
fewer subjects and this is more cost
effective less time consuming and
generally less expensive however there
are also a few disadvantages one of
which is carryover effects for example
let's say we have this new method of
teaching math you want to know if it's
going to be effective if you use the
same group of students to test this new
teaching method inevitably they're gonna
be better at math the second time around
so if the first time we teach them one
way and then the second lesson we teach
them a different way they'll already be
better at math from learning it the
first time then we don't know if the
results after the second treatment are
due to the fact that it was effective or
due to the fact that they've learned
math before that's just one example the
second measurement can get affected by
the first treatment and the order in
which we give the treatment might
influence the results for example say we
want to test two types of pills what if
the first pill has some kind of
interaction with the second pill and so
by taking it in that order they affect
the results therefore in this lesson
you're going to learn about independent
samples
whereas deep
samples deals with within subject
designs independent samples deals with
between subject designs in this case the
advantages of dependent samples are the
disadvantages of independent samples and
the disadvantages of dependent samples
are the advantages of independent
samples so that make sense with
independent samples we need more
subjects because we need to randomize
the two groups taking the two treatments
we need a larger end to control for
individual differences as best as
possible that means it's more
time-consuming and generally more
expensive but then the advantages of
independent samples are that we don't
have carryover effects therefore we can
give one treatment to one group another
treatment to another group and not worry
about one treatment affecting the other
because each person or each subject only
gets one treatment with independent
samples we can do an experimental test
where we give treatments to the subjects
or observational where we simply observe
characteristics of two different
populations and then compare them
everything is exactly the same the null
and alternative hypotheses the
t-statistic
and the way we make our statistical
decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
