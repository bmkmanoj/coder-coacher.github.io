about before you start optimizing
portfolios one of them will help your
optimization run faster and the other is
essential for you to get the right
answer let's start with the faster thing
first the first thing you can do is you
can tell the optimizer that it should
only look at certain ranges for X in
other words for this problem for each of
the various allocations it's only worth
looking at values between 0 &amp;amp; 1 in other
words a value of 2 would indicate 200
percent of your fund is in a particular
asset and that's not possible
it's only feasible to have 0% to 100% or
0 to 1 in each of these assets so you
can tell the optimizer only focus on
values between 0 &amp;amp; 1 for each of the
dimensions of X and if you do that the
optimizer can run much more quickly
because it knows not to look at other
values of X outside those bounds it
limits the search area significantly
another thing you can do with the
optimizer Xin numpy are provide
constraints constraints are properties
of the values of X that must be true as
an example we want the sum of our
allocations to add up to 1
so let's say for example we're trying to
optimize for portfolio of 4 holdings so
we have X 0 X 1 X 2 X 3 we want the sum
of the absolute values of those to be
equal to 1.0 in other words our total
allocation should add up to 100% the
optimizers we use in this class have the
ability for you to express that and that
guarantees that at the end when it finds
out the values for X you end up with a
total of 100% allocated to the various
assets now we're going to show you how
to do these two things in the assignment
text itself because the syntax is a
little bit tricky and we want to convey
to you exactly how to do that so we look
forward to seeing you solve this problem
and good luck on your final project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
