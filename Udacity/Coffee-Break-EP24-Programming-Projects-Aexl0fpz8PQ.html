hi welcome to coffee break I'm Brenna
and I work with Udacity a student
community at Udacity we think that
programming is awesome whether you might
want to become a software engineer or
whether you want to use programming for
your personal projects we think that
everyone can benefit from a little basic
programming here are some people who
agree with us and have shared their
personal programming projects so when I
was 13 years old I started a fan website
online for a series of books that I
really really liked in middle school and
I was like I really want to talk to
other kids about this but nobody had
read it and so I went online looking for
other fan websites and there weren't
that many so I decided to start my own
and so I combined my experience with
HTML and CSS with my love for these
books and I built this fair and website
and over the last six or seven years
it's grown to be one of the biggest
Twilight Saga fan sites online so it's
been a big part of me for me one of the
big things when coming from an art
background and never thought that having
any programming experience would
actually be helpful which is actually
completely not the case like it is
actually incredibly helpful like I am
right now I do paintings that are
interactive and how I do them is there
within the canvas I embed like LED
lights and on the back side of campus I
Bernard Reno that I can program
different light sequences and that's
something that like years ago like I
would never a thought like I could do
this I'm like I can make that happen
even programming simulations like having
like the detail on a simulation or like
even within like the graphics and like
being able to make things so looks so
real but also like fun like that's
something where I can take both my like
art background and actually implement it
and that's something for me that's like
it's making what I enjoy more real if
you want to get started today you can
with Udacity cs101 course intro to
computer science is free self paced and
online and your first personal project
will be building your own search engine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
