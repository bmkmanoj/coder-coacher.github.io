spectrum on one extreme ended extremely
formal concepts but which we can define
logical conditions that are necessary
and sufficient for that concept will
examine that with more detail in just a
minute on the other hand the spectrum of
less formal concepts which it's hard to
define necessary and sufficient
condition now here are three points on
the spectrum axiomatic concept prototype
concept exemplar concepts there can be
other types of concepts as well we're
just going to consider these three
concepts because they are the three most
common ones and we look at each one of
them in turn in general humans find it
easier to communicate about these eggs
Ematic concepts because they are
well-defined there is a set of necessary
and sufficient conditions that we all
agree with examples of mathematical
concepts humans find it harder to
communicate about prototype concepts but
most of the time we do quite well it's
even harder to talk about example are
concepts like let's say beauty of
freedom similarly it's easy to teach
computers about axiomatic concepts or
programming so many concepts into
computers it's much harder to program
with teach prototype concept and much
much harder to teach or program exemplar
type concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
