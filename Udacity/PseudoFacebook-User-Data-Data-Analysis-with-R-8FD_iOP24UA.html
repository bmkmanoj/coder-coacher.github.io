others Dean will give us more advice and
discuss the big picture when doing EDA
for now let's start by loading up some
data you can find a data file in the
instructor notes this data file contains
all the Facebook data that we're going
to be looking at to load up the data
let's first make sure that we're in the
right directory here's my current
directory and I can see that I'm in a
folder that has the datasets I can use
the list that files command to figure
out what files are within this directory
and here's the data set that I want the
pseudo Facebook data set to read in the
data set I'm going to use the read csv
command but i need to be a little bit
careful i need to indicate that the
separator is really a tab and that's
because we're working with a tab
separated values file running the
command I can see that I get my data set
up and are now this data set is similar
to the kind that data scientists see
from time to time at Facebook and it's
especially the type of data that they'll
use when doing EDA this file has
approximately 99 thousand rows or
observations in it with 15 variables
each observation represents a user and
that user will have different
information such as their age their name
or their date of birth we can see all
these variables are running the names
command now in this entire process our
goal is to understand our users behavior
and their demographics we only want to
understand what they're doing on
Facebook and what they use this is why
you see things like friend count
ww likes and mobile likes we created
this dataset specifically for this
course to have many features common to
such user level behavioral and
demographic data but I need to say that
this data is an actual Facebook data so
not all statistics in this data set are
going to be accurate representations of
how people use Facebook on a day to day
basis so our lawyers want me to make the
disclaimer that this is an actual data
from Facebook users but we did use a
complex model to generate it and I think
we can learn some very interesting
things about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
