variables for now I want to draw your
attention to the age range variable
right here notice that it says that we
have a factor variable with seven
different levels we can examine the
levels of a variable by typing in the
command and then putting in the variable
right here and the console we can see
the seven levels of the age range
variable now instead of creating a table
of the age range variable let's create a
plot that shows how many users are in
each bin that is we want to figure out
how many survey respondents are between
the ages of 18 and 24 25 and 34 and so
on I'm gonna create this plot using the
ggplot2 package and the queue plot
function that comes with it again don't
worry about understanding this code too
much we'll have practice with this in
the next lesson
when I run this code I get my plot over
here zooming in on this plot I want you
to notice that the age groups appear to
be in order this is true for everyone
except the survey takers who are under
the age of 18 now it would be really
helpful if this bar was really oriented
over here that way we could make
comparisons across the groups more
easily now this is why we would want to
have ordered factors the variable age
range just contains factors with seven
levels but these levels aren't arranged
in any particular order sometimes we
want to introduce order into our data
set so that way we can make more
readable plots so knowing a little bit
about ordered factors let's see if you
can answer this next question if you
haven't already done so download the
reddit survey data and look at its
structure
after you looked at the structure of the
variables try and answer this question
which of these variables in the dataset
could also be converted to an ordered
factor just like age range check any of
the variables that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
