successor function so we got to put them
back in some place and I'm going to
generalize a little bit instead of
talking about times I'm going to talk
about costs for a path just thinking of
maybe we might want to do some other
problems that also have paths in them
and that aren't dealing with optimizing
time but are dealing with optimizing
some type of cost so I want you to do
for me is to find this function paskoff
which takes a path as input and returns
the total cost of that path and that's
already stored away we don't have to
compute anything new because we decided
that our convention for pass was it was
going to be stored there that is we said
that a path is equal to a state followed
by an action and a total cost followed
by another state etc and here I've just
said well if we don't have any actions
there if the if it's the empty path then
do one thing otherwise do something else
and then I also want you to find the
bridge cost be cost is the abbreviation
I'll use and that's the cost of an
individual action so an action in this
domain is something like 25 arrow to the
right and I want you to figure out
what's the cost of that action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
