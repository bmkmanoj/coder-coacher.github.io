that systematizes how we solved it and
we're gonna write this as pseudocode
that means we're not worrying about the
details of how to write exactly correct
Python we're trying to get the idea down
and see if it makes sense so let's think
about how we solved the problem as a
human again here's how we started we
looked at our start date which was
January 24 and we counted the number of
days remaining in January we did that by
just counting up if we started earlier
we might not want to count it every day
so we can subtract the total number of
days in January from the day we started
so that will be our starting point and
we're going to keep the result in a
variable called days and we'll start by
initializing days to the number of days
in the current month - the day that
we're starting on so for the example
that was 31 for the number of days in
January - 24 which I believe is 7 and
once we've done that well we finished
month one so we should increase the
value of month one by one so now we were
at February and now we started going
through the months until we got to the
month we were on so he went through each
month until we got up to the month we
were looking for which was June so
that's sort of like a while loop we're
doing something over and over again
until we get to the stopping condition
so we can write that as pseudocode we're
gonna keep going while the current month
is less than the target month we're
gonna add the number of days in the
current month and we're going to
increase the current month by one now
we're not quite done
we still need to account for the day in
the month that we arrived at and there
we just add that day so if it was day
one of June we would add one since we
didn't actually get into June now we're
gonna add 29 since the 29th was our
target day we haven't yet accounted for
years for this example that was okay but
for other cases we're gonna need to
account for years so let's think about
how to do that we can do it similarly to
how we accounted for month well we're
not up to the same year we're going to
add the number of days in that year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
