Charles and he has quite a story here ok
so we know that Peter is very excited
about launching his new search engine
bitches this is true search with Peter
that infos actually watched a really
cool thing yeah I put a lot of work into
it and web 2.0 and all that with some
put lettuce suppose that he is targeting
the underserved market Klingon language
web searches let us suppose also Lee is
writing some custom hashing procedure
after eight months of explosive growth
and business I hope so Peter finds that
he needs to double the number of buckets
in his hash table he also finds that the
hash buckets are not utilized evenly
since he did not understand the hashing
of Klingon very well
sounds like a hard problem so his
question is how can we rehash the index
without service interruptions this is
made more difficult by the fact that his
user base may get violent if he delays
search results and additionally the long
latency of intergalactic networks means
he also needs to a careful rollout of
the new hash what strategy should he I
guess I take Wow well this is quite a
question from Captain Kirk I'm glad he
is hoping for the success of search with
Peter Don info and thinking about the
future is an important thing to do I
think what one thing I understand is
that the Klingon name servers don't
support the Dalian foe domain so I think
you're probably safe from from the
Klingon attack for now but it's it's a
good question to think about what
happens when you have to rehash a table
so we've been talking about you know the
standard way a hash table works once the
buckets get too full or the load factors
too high you want to create a new table
with more buckets and you've got to copy
all your entries into it if you're
running a big service like search with
Peter Don info well you don't want to
shut down your service well you do that
that would get people pretty annoyed and
if they're Klingons that's you don't
want to get them annoyed so what you
could do instead and there are lots of
different things and I don't know what
Google does I'm sure they're there lots
of solutions that are possible and
they've figured out something that works
well one thing to do would be that start
a new copy so you keep the search engine
going still responding the queries using
the old hash table when you start a
separate process of running on a
separate computer something that's
making a new copy the hash table with a
larger
of buckets and then when you're done
with that you switch them over and you
have the larger table of new buckets
going and other than the switch over
there's no interruption and service when
you do that there's some things that
make this hard you've got to worry about
well what if a new entry is added to the
hash table while you're in the middle of
copying it you could lock it so make it
so you can't add any new entries during
that time that might be a bad thing if
it takes a long time to copy you can
maybe add the entry of both hash tables
every time a new entry is added yeah
both to the original and the copy as
you're developing it you could save the
updates and apply them all later after
you finish the copy so there are lots of
tough problems to solve to make this
work without interruptions but it's
definitely important question to think
about if you're building search with
Peter Don info and you have a lot of
angry probably should have been taken
pending on the service well we'll see
hopefully the Klingons don't know where
you live we recently would reached 50
users on search with Peter and info we
had a cake and throw party
cool congratulation I think that's great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
