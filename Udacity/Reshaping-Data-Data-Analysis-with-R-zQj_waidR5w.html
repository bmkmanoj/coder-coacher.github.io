code to reshape our data frame into a
new one first let's install and load the
art reshape to package now let's create
a variable for our new data frame that
will be in wide format I'll use the same
variable name for the data frame and
just add wide to the end now we're going
to make use of the D cast function which
comes with the our shape to package the
letter D is used since we want the
result to be a data frame if we wanted
an array or a matrix we could use a cast
we specify the data set we are going to
change and then we put in a formula so
here's the data frame I want to modify
and then this is where I'll enter my
formula now the first part of the
formula are the part to the left of the
tilde sign will list the variables I
want to keep with an addition sign in
between them here I just want to keep
age on the right side of the tilde we
use the gender variable since we want
male and female users to have their own
columns for median friend count in the
data frame and finally we set value bar
equal to median friend count because
value dot bar holds the key measurements
or the values in our new data frame and
it looks like that I forgot quotes
around this variable so let me add that
now we should get a new data frame let's
look at some of this data frames so that
way we can make sure we understand this
D cast function here are some of the
rows print it out and notice I have my
age column my female median friend count
and my male median friend count see if
you can recreate these steps on your own
and try playing around with the D cast
and melt functions in the reshape to
package the melt function will allow you
to convert the Y data back to the
original long format</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
