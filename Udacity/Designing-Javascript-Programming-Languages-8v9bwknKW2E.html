with Brendan Eich the CTO of Mozilla and
the designer of JavaScript I was
wondering if you could tell us a bit
about how that language came to be sure
so I could say more about how I got
ready to make JavaScript because when i
arrived at Netscape I didn't have much
time to do it and I had to have the
skills already and I've interested in
writing programming language
implementations for my entire career
when I got into computer science it was
from physics and was first by studying
theory of formal languages and automata
theory regular languages regular
expressions this was in the early 80s
and I love the the cleanliness of the
theory and the rather direct way of
implementing a lot of the serious as
algorithms so that you could you can
make a parser or a lexer
semi-automatically or automatically this
was very interesting to me that it was
useful to I think every very practicing
programmer should take time doing bed
language at some point there's often a
need you have that no particular
language is perfect for or you have some
leisure time and you can use that it's
educational and it can often solve your
problem better than any other language
and so I encourage that and I did that
myself throughout my career and that
sort of helped me get ready to do
javascript because when i got the
netscape and the heat of the moment was
there with java blooming and questions
about whether we need two languages a
scripting language versus a big Lenny
much like Java I had to go fast so I had
to have it all sort of in my my muscles
I had to have some practice already
underway think
so in this class we will learn a lot of
the things that he just mentioned at
various points regular expressions
finite state machines having a lexer
fall out of that automatically
context-free grammars parsing having a
parser fall out of that automatically
and I can only say that I really agree
I've written a number of little
languages in my time to scratch various
itches I think it's a really important
tool to have under one's belt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
