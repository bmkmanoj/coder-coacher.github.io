debugging course where we review the
material we've seen so far and put it
all together now at the end of the
course let's put everything together to
see what we do when we encounter a new
bug when we see a new bug the first
thing we do is to make sure it gets
processed so we enter it in the problem
database we've seen the stages the
problem report goes through from
unconfirmed via new to assigned when
it's assigned to an individual developer
and finally resolved and closed any new
problem needs to go into the problem
database any new problem needs to go
into the problem database in the long
run tracking problems also helps you in
coming up with statistics on how long it
takes you to fix the bug how many bugs
they are that still need to be fixed as
well as where the bugs are that need to
be fixed such that in your program you
know where the locations are that over
time have the highest bug density and
therefore need special attention for all
of this
tracking the problem is the first
prerequisite the next step is to
reproduce the problem because only when
you are reproducing a problem do you
know whether you will actually be able
to fix it we have seen what the
individual inputs are that all influence
a program execution most important being
static data user interaction and the
interaction with the environment but
also more trivial issues like the
debugger which influences the program or
time randomness and other issues that
may be hard to control in order to
reproduce the problem you must get all
of these under your control reproducing
a problem can be particularly hard when
you're collecting such data from the
field because data and user interaction
may contain sensitive data this is why
we have also seen that the tech
weeks of statistical debugging which
relate execution features such as align
in the program being executed or not to
failures and success by collecting such
data from the field you will be able to
find out which features of the execution
correlate with failures and these
features can be features such as
executed lines or return values of
functions the next step in debugging is
to automate and simplify the idea being
that you write a test case by which you
can reproduce the bug at any time
automatically at first this is helpful
of course for during regression testing
such that you can always verify whether
the problem is there or not however it
is also helpful to automatically
simplify the problem if you have a big
input which causes a failure then an
automated test can help you
automatically simplifying this input the
technique of Delta debugging takes this
big input and with the help of an
automated test automatically simplifies
it to an input in which every single
item is relevant for reproducing the
failure this can be a great aid as it
comes to understanding what makes the
failure occur and what not once you have
simplified the problem the next step
will be to find possible infection
origin if your program fails you can see
its execution as a succession of states
the last state is what you see as a
failure and you want to figure out where
did this failure come from the concept
of dependencies helps you figuring out
the possible sources of an infection and
rule out all the other ones when you're
tracking back where a failure came from
you frequently have the choice of
looking at multiple possible origins and
what you would like to do is to focus
first on those origins which are most
likely if you know that some state is
already infected that is wrong you will
focus on this one first if you know from
some earlier state that the
cause this later state you will also
like to focus on this one if you know
from statistical debugging that some
feature is correlated with a failure go
for it
and if you have reason to believe that
some particular state is likely to be
buggy anyway for instance because of its
bug history you also go for it and we
have seen techniques how to determine
all of these in particular assertions
which help a lot for finding out
immediately during the execution whether
some part of the state is erroneous or
not the sixth step is to isolate the
infection chain what this means is for
every likely origin you go and conduct
an experiment to see whether it actually
is the cause of the failure for this he
used the scientific method you set up a
hypothesis this could be the cause this
could be the cause this could be the
cause make up an appropriate prediction
set up an experiment and based on the
observation you either refine your
hypothesis or your reject your
hypothesis be sure to make these steps
explicit as it helps structure your
thinking and as it helps you
interrupting and resuming your debugging
activities as needed
you repeat this going backwards
throughout the program until you arrive
at a place where the incoming data is
same but the outgoing data is infected
the statement which generates this
infection is the defect this is the last
step of debugging to correct the defect
such that it no longer produces an
infection but actually makes the program
behave correct before you fix the defect
you should be sure that the defect
actually is the defect that is that by
changing it appropriately the problem
will be fixed you should have a clear
understanding about how your correction
fixes the defect
and then there's also some chores to be
made you need to verify that the failure
no longer occurs need to make sure that
your correction did not introduce new
problems and again assertions as we've
seen them in this course help you a lot
with that you may also wish to search
your code to check whether the same
mistake was made elsewhere and fix these
locations as well note how these seven
steps of debugging can be easily
memorized by looking at their first
letters which form the word traffic
traffic may not immediately be related
to debugging unless you're debugging
traffic programs but the way that
infections propagate through the program
and what's happening during a program
execution can be as confusing as modern
traffic in a real big city with these
seven steps you're done with debugging
congratulations and now let's move on to
the next bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
