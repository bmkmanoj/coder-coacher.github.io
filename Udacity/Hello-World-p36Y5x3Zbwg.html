running awesome work
now you're going to participate in
important programming tradition making a
hello world app this is the basically
the first step towards becoming an
Android developer and at the end of the
lesson
you're going to take this hello world
app and you're going to change it into
the birthday card out so you might be
wondering what exactly is a hello world
program well typically in programming
languages one of the easiest things you
could do is print out some words to the
screen so therefore usually the first
program that you'll make in a
programming language is a program that
will do exactly that print some word out
to the screen it's kind of like when
you're studying a new human language how
you'll learn words like thank you or
please or excuse me where's the bathroom
as so do your first building blocks of
that language okay let's build the hello
world out a quick note before we get
started this video was recorded April 6
2015 now my suggestion to you is that
you don't follow along with the video
instead go ahead and watch the video
through once after you're done with that
we've provided some text instructions in
the instructor notes from time to time
Android studio is updated which means
that menus or screens can look a little
bit different and while the video might
be out of date the text instructions
will be updated a lot more regularly
ok so if you've closed a turd studio go
ahead and reopen Android studio you
should be staring at this screen I'm
going to go ahead and click on this
aptly named start a new Android studio
project button alright that should take
you to this screen where we have a
couple of different options the first
one is the application name this is the
name that you'll see in the app bar at
the top of the app as well as the all
apps screen of the device preemptively
I'm going to go ahead and name this
happy birthday okay right below this we
have copy domain and if this looks
similar to our web address you're right
normally if you owned a web address
you'd type it in here now at one point
in my life I owned
lyla fujiwara com so if I was making an
app for myself instead of a demo app for
all of you I would go ahead and change
this to Lila Fujiwara com now you might
be wondering why well if I was planning
to distribute my app on Google Play this
package name down here
is something that I need to uniquely
identify my app meaning that across all
of the people in the world who are
making apps this needs to be completely
unique now if we look a little bit more
the structure of this the package name
is actually the company domain reversed
so instead of Lila Fujiwara com
we have Kamuela Fujiwara followed by the
application name with no spaces so while
there might be a couple of different app
developers that make a happy birthday
app you're not going to have a bunch of
app developers that all own Lila
Fujiwara comm and they're making a
birthday card app and in the way that
the Internet is set up if I buy Lila
Fujiwara com that means I should have
complete control over what is shown
there and nobody else can buy that
domain name and if I own it and it's
specific to me then that helps ensure
that this package name is completely
unique so I know that you only know
about package names right now you might
not know what a package is we'll talk
about that more a little bit later but
the thing that you just need to keep in
mind right now is that a package name
needs to be unique so that Google Play
and your phone has a unique way to
identify your application okay but
you're not me and you don't own this
domain and since we're all practicing
together and I want us all to have sort
of the same setup for this app I'm going
to change this to Android example comm
and you should go ahead and use the same
company domain name because I know that
some of you won't actually own website
domains yourself also it'll help you
batch our code and if you look below you
should see that it says com non-examples
not android again that's the reverse of
android example comm and that it says
happy birthday after it okay so the next
thing that you can change is the project
location this is where all the files
that have to deal with your app will be
saved on your computer
now usually Android studio will create a
folder for your Android studio projects
and the default is to just put your app
inside this folder you can see that the
name actually matches the name of the
folder that it will be in this is a
pretty good default location so unless
you have any strong reason to change it
I'd go ahead and just click Next okay
now this is a fun screen it lets us pick
what phones and devices that we're going
to actually make our application for now
you're making an app for a phone in a
tablet and you're not trying to make an
app for tea
beware or glass so we're going to leave
these all unchecked the drop-down right
here shows us the version of the Android
operating system that our application
will support I'm going to go ahead and
scroll up we can see that the first
public and widely used release of
Android was called cupcake with this
release Google started a convention
where they would continue to go
alphabetically but named each operating
system off of desserts or sugary treats
cupcake was followed by donut and Eclair
and this is why you'll see words like
Ice Cream Sandwich honeycomb and KitKat
in the drop-down menu now below this
drop-down you'll see this handy help me
choose link this graph shows some
helpful percentages of how many people
who have Android phones use the
different operating system versions
looking at it we can see that most user
is at least at the time of this
recording are using the deliciously
named KitKat the percentages show the
percentage of people in the world use at
Google Play who will be able to use our
app if we pick one of these as our
minimum supported version so if you pick
the newest version of the operating
system which is lollipop at least at the
time of this recording only users with
new phones would be able to download
your app and that would mean you to only
have about 0.1% of all the phone users
actually able to download your app so
you might be asking why not make it AB
or all phones by picking the oldest
version of the operating system here's a
picture the first commercially available
Android phone the t-mobile g1 which was
also known outside the United States as
the HTC dream it was released in 2008
and ran Android 1.0 obviously a lot has
changed since then for example apps like
Google Wallet which let you pay for
groceries of the wave of your smart
phone require a near field communication
a near field communication or NFC was
actually a type of hardware that didn't
make it into Android phones until 2010
so if you're making an app that requires
NFC there's no reason to even try
supporting older phones like this that
are running older versions of the
Android operating system anyway for the
purposes of your app I want you to use
API 15 which is Ice Cream Sandwich this
should work for about 90% of the phone
users out there alright go ahead and
click Next
I want to interrupt here for an
important update since filming the orig
video the activity templates have
actually been updated and changed so
your screens are going to look a little
bit different than what you're seeing in
the video right now if you're using
Android studio version 1.4 or newer
you're going to see these screens
instead and instead of selecting blank
activity what I want you to do is select
the empty activity template this will
generate the correct files that will
allow you to follow along with the rest
of the course on this screen you're
given a bunch of starting templates you
can choose from depending on what you're
trying to make you're going to go ahead
and choose blank activity which is
already selected because it's the
simplest one and I'm going to click Next
finally this screen gives you the
opportunity to name a couple of
different files that are going to be
automatically generated for your
application as you'll soon see an
application is composed of all the
picture files sound files XML files Java
files and more that are required to make
the app basically there are a lot of
files that work together to make your
application we'll talk about this all
soon for now take a look at the layout
name you've been working on xml layout
files so this is the name of the file
we'll be editing in just a little bit
i'm actually not going to change any of
these defaults so you can go ahead and
click finish now depending on your
computer speed it might take a moment to
set everything up if you looked out here
you'll actually see a little loading
circle as well as a loading bar and we
can see a loading circle down here as
well meaning that it's continuing to
think about things so take a break go
ahead stretch and get some tea or I mean
coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
