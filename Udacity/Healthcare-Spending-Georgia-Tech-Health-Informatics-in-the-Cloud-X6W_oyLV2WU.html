important because these are some of the
reasons that the u.s. spends far more
per capita typically twice as much on
health care than other advanced
industrialized nations that's certainly
true if you again compare the u.s. to
France moreover while increases in US
health care spending have slowed in
recent years for reasons that aren't yet
clear historically our health care costs
have grown much faster than those in
this same group of Nations the
inexorable growth of chronic disease is
one of the key reasons why that spending
might be okay if we were getting a great
result but again comparing the US here
to this group of industrialized
countries and even some others we rank
26th in life expectancy shown here we're
also a clear outlier spending far more
but dying younger than the citizens of
these other countries has been far less
clearly a serious problem but you may be
asking what does it have to do with
health informatics we turn to that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
