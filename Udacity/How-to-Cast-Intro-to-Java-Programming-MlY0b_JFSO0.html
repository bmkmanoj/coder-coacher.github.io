convince the Java compiler to do it
anyway this is a very strange syntax
whose origins are somewhere in the midst
of time of programming languages and we
won't dwell on that but here's what you
need to do this value here is of type
double now we don't want it to be a
double we want it to be an integer and
then you have to put the name of the
type that you want int put parentheses
around it and put it before the
expression you want to convert what now
happens is this expression here is
computed the fractional part is
discarded the integer part is moved over
here this operation is called a cast
that's a curious name are we casting out
a fishing rod is it cast around a broken
foot the cast of characters in a play
well I guess it's mostly like the latter
because we have for this value here that
actually is a fractional number and we
want to cast it not as the hero in the
play but as an integer whatever that's
that's what it's called every once in a
while you need to do this you have
something that's not of the type that
you want you want to change its type and
the cast notation does that for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
