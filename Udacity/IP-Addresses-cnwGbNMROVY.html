across a local area network we now turn
our attention to how they communicate
across the internet and the network
layer of our hierarchy whereas other
layers use a variety of technologies and
protocols the network layer really only
uses IP which is short for Internet
Protocol every machine on the Internet
proper gets a unique 32-bit address
which is usually written out as four
decimal numbers between 0 and 255 so for
example 72 dot 14.2 48 to 39 is
currently the IP address for Udacity
home page ranges of addresses are
allocated by regional internet
registries all of which are under
control of Vienna the International
assigned numbers authority the range of
themselves are commonly specified by a
32 bit IP followed by a slash and then
the number of bits understood to specify
the network ID this is referred to as
site a notation the first number of
these bits of the 32 specify the range
and then the rightmost bits specify the
particular host for example MIT was
allocated long ago the arranged 1800 0/8
meaning that any IP starting with 18
belongs to MIT they're about to the 24th
of them Georgia Tech has the range 130
207 0 0 / 6 teen meaning that any IP
starting with 130 207 belongs to Georgia
Tech they're about 2 to the 16th of
those because there are 16 unspecified
bits in this range at the time of this
recording a New Jersey name company
called the node has been allocated the
address range 50 dot 1648 0/20 this
gives them 12 bits of host and the range
50 dot 116 dot 48.0 250 1663 dot 255
again about 2 to the 12th ip's IPS have
become a precious commodity these days
as most all of them have been allocated
and not very efficiently for instance
tech savvy as they are MIT is probably
not using all to 24 or 16 million of its
addresses one solution to this problem
is simply to expand the address
is to use more bits the new internet
protocol called ipv6 the old one is
called ipv4 uses a 128 bit IP addresses
the problem is that ipv4 is so Universal
and so many other systems depend on it
that adoption of the new protocol has
been slow I encourage you to read more
about this on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
