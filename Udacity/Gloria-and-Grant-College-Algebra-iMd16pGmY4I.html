of grant for all of his glasses wiper
success but she actually has a very
successful career as well she's a
wildlife conservation specialist in fact
she just got some really exciting news
she's about to go to china for a couple
of months to work at a giant panda
sanctuary a nature preserve that
protects pandas to help their population
rebuild Gloria needs to learn all about
how pandas became an endangered species
and how effective different conservation
efforts have been so that she can be as
helpful as possible during her time in
China now the preserve she's going to
has actually made a ton of progress in
helping its panda population grow here's
a graph showing how the number of pandas
in the sanctuary has changed from year

the number of years that have passed
since the opening of the sanctuary and
the vertical axis shows the number of
pandas living there how many pandas did
the sanctuary start out with in other
words how many did they have after zero
years how many did they have after ten
years how about after 22 years and
lastly what about after 30 years that's
this last data point which represents
