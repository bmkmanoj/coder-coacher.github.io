example application called app in our
app we have three applications monolith
hello and off service the mom this
service combines authentication and
hello micro services let's run the
monolithic application now to see how it
works our application is built and we
can test this functionality using curl
and we can see we got a response back
it's working now let's try this a care
endpoint the request fails because we
need to get a JWT token from the login
endpoint so let's do that now I'm going
to type password at the prompt now that
I have a data beauty token I can hit the
secure endpoint using curl and it should
work as expected everything is working
now a couple of things about the example
service I should point out while it's a
model of the application it does
leverage many principles found in 12
factor applications for example we are
logging to standard output so logging
tools can pick up our logs without
touching any log files you'll also
notice the model of application is
self-contained
we are bundling all of our dependencies
in the vendor directory following these
practices make our application easier to
maintain and deploy to the cloud
something we're striving for in this
course I'll kick it over to Carter to
explain more about 12 factor and micro
services in death</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
