debugging works on paper we should
actually go and implement it as a Python
program here we start implementing the
Delta debugging function formally this
is the Delta debugging algorithm for
minimizing so we call it DD min for
Delta debugging minimizing and it takes
an input and it takes a string as a
parameter this is the string to be
simplified we could make the diamond
even more generic by also passing the
test function as a parameter then we
could use it for arbitrary tests in
arbitrary contact for this exercise
however we'll simply use the hard-wired
testing function which you already have
seen and we start with the assertion
that again testing the entire input
should fail we have a variable n which
sets the granularity as described before
this is initially 2 we also have a while
loop which loops while the input still
has at least 2 characters if it has 1
character then there is nothing left to
simplify we define the length of the
individual subset by simply dividing the
length of the entire input by our
current generating and we have a loop
guarding here this variable will be set
as soon as some tests failed the
variable start is a cursor over the
input which tells us where to start
chopping away individual parts of the
input and here precisely we do the
chopping start tells us where to start
chopping away things that is everything
up to start should be included in our
test then beginning from start plus the
length of a subset we also want this to
be included in our testing input what's
missing in here of course is a string
starting from start with the length
subset length this is what we test and
we check whether the result is fail that
is if after chopping away a subset the
test fails well what do we do them we
set our input to the complement that is
we keep on working with a now simplified
string we decrease the granularity by 1
but don't let it fall below 2 and we
said the variable sum complement is
failing to true because we need this to
step out of this loop which we do right
away if the test has
not fail then we have to proceed to the
next subset which we get by simply
increasing our start cursor which now
points to the beginning of the next
subset and this is something we do until
we have reached the end of our string so
now at this point we have gone through
all the subsets and either some
complement has failed then this variable
is true so far so good we simply keep on
working with these new reduced
simplified inputs and a decreased
granularity however if all of these
tests pass what should we do remember
the third step in the Delta debugging
algorithm we now need to increase the
granularity but must make sure it
doesn't get over the length of the total
string and I will leave it to you as a
programming exercise to complete this
code over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
