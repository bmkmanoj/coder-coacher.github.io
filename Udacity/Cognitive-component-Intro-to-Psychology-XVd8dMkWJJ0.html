far first we had the affective component
which was our feelings and emotions and
as we just saw with my example of the
Red Wings
we had the behavioral component and this
is a tendency to act in a certain way
towards something clearly you could see
how I act towards the Red Wings and the
third component of our attitudes is the
cognitive component and this is our
thoughts beliefs and ideas about
something our attitudes can vary in
terms of how heavily each component is
weighed that is you may have a more
cognitive component for some attitudes
for example maybe the best way to make
cheese fondue it may be more heavily
weighted from the cognitive component as
opposed to something such as your
attitude towards abortion which may have
a more affective component although most
of our basic attitudes may be
instinctive we do know that some of our
attitudes are learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
