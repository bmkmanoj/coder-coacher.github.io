concept of a warp now remember that a
warp is a set of threads that operate in
lockstep all executing the same
instruction at the same time on whatever
data they happen to be processing and
its general technique is called Sim D
that stands for single instruction
multiple data this is a term you'll hear
a lot in parallel computing computer
architects have been building Sindhi
processors for decades it saves a lot of
transistors and a lot of power if you
can amortize the work used to decode and
fetch and perform a single instruction
against multiple pieces of data at once
all modern CPUs use vector instructions
and the most typical one on Intel CPUs
are called SSE or AVX instruction sets
and these are ways that the CPU can
execute the same instruction on multiple
pieces of data at once and going back to
a point I made at the very beginning of
this lecture on the CPU if you're
performing an SSE instruction you're
using in a single clock cycle you're
affecting four pieces of data on a V X
you could be affecting eight pieces of
data these vector registers represent a
huge amount of the computational
horsepower and if you're not using them
on the CPU then you're missing most of
the power of your processor another term
you'll see a lot is sim T this is a term
coined by Nvidia to stand for single
instruction multiple threads and this is
a subtle distinction that has to do with
what happens when there is thread
divergence let me explain what that
means it all comes down to what happens
at a branch in the code here's some code
with an if-else statement and I'll color
the instruction stream black for
instructions that all the threads are
going to execute red for instructions
that only threads that take this branch
in E of statement will execute blue for
instructions that only threads that take
the else branch will execute and black
