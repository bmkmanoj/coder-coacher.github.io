of this imagine I have an input image
which has been d focused and what we
basically want to do is now look at
remember all those d focus regions and
we looked at basically calibrate these
blur kernels at different depths if you
calibrate them perhaps we can now model
the response on an image because of
different types you know different blur
kernels that are coming in because again
these are response functions we saw when
we move two objects around if you
actually went through an exercise of
doing that what we did of trying to move
an object we might be able to kind of
build a model that could be used to
generate this information so let's look
at this a little bit more carefully so
imagine I could now come up with some
sort of a local sub window and also look
at how to calibrate blur Colonel for
that image would look at at certain
depth k that would actually be FK so I
have a window YK i have a new calibrated
blur at different depths k and we call
that FK basically now we can basically
come up with a sharp output X on that
sub window by doing what we know how to
do which is convolutions right so if it
basically means is for a specific depth
I can now come up with different types
of images so k1 k2 and k3 so i'm just
showing your simple table here this is
my image i found different sub windows
and i can now compute if i know the blur
kernel and these are again if you notice
the ones we looked at as from the
examples of images earlier when we
basically move the lens move the object
the light source away from the lens
we've got different spread functions out
of it we can actually use this now of
course compute sharp images and of
course no surprise to you how would we
do this is a simple convolution of the
calibrated right colonel with the sharp
window here to be able to create a local
sub window right so this is how we would
actually do it this is the forward
process if i had this i would actually
be able to compute it of course my
interest isn't actually computing this
right i want to be able to come up with
the Sharps of window so the inverse of
this process is what we are interested
in but we can actually do calibration
this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
