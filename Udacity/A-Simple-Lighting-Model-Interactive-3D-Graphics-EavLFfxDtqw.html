nothing yet about materials say we have
a red ball how do we make the GPU
compute how the lights in the scene and
the balls material interact so that the
ball looks real
when performing interactive rendering a
standard way to think about a materials
appearance is as a few different
components added together emissive
ambient diffuse and specular the idea of
the emissive term is that it's for
coloring glowing objects for example a
light bulb has its own color and other
white sources don't really affect it in
reality the emissive term is simply a
way to add in some constant color
regardless of the lighting conditions
the second component ambient is a fudge
factor something added in so objects
look better especially in areas that are
not directly light you'll see it in
various systems controlled in various
ways when all is said and done the
ambient term helps compute a constant
color value that is added to the
fragments final color the emissive and
ambient terms are kept separate as they
fulfill different functions and often
have different controls for example
three Jas allows you to set an ambient
light that affects all materials with an
ambient term remember that we made a
simplification with lights in a scene we
assume photons come only from lights and
don't bounce around in reality photons
would reflect from the floor to the
bottom of the sphere to our eye however
with our assumption the lower part of
the sphere doesn't get any light and so
it would look black the ambient term
gives us at least some color in these
types of areas instead of being entirely
black the diffuse and specular
components are computed based on the
lights in the scene while the emissive
an ambient are essentially independent
of these the diffuse term can be thought
of as a flat matte finish and spikier
can be thought of as the shininess of an
object in terms of computation the
specular term is also affected by the
viewers location while the diffuse term
is determined only by each lights
location</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
