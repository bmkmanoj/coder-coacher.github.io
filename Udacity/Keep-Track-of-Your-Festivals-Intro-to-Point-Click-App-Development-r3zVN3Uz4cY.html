type okay so okay I've got all these
different choices of data type what's
going on so it's pretty overwhelming the
different field types at first because
there's so many but really the most
important thing to note is that you just
want to be able to pick the field type
that's closest to you whatever type of
field you're trying to track okay so if
we're doing a start date is date good
date sounds great okay and next I guess
okay field label I'm gonna go a start
date sounds good this is what you're
gonna see on that page that we were just
on as a little label for this field okay
and what's the difference being that in
the name the field name is the actual
API name that it stores in the database
so that just needs to be a unique value
is that fair like if you're gonna do
some coding stuff any sort of code or
maybe some formulas like we'll go build
later so description is this I guess I
should fill this out right the date the
festival starts what's helped texture
it's I guess a field that people don't
really understand you can add that
little help text so they can get more
details about it pretty clear okay um
all right I'm not gonna make this a
required value sometimes you have
festivals maybe you don't know the date
yet or something so yeah okay next oh my
goodness more check boxes yeah so this
wizard really takes us through every
sort of aspect that you might need to
consider around building a field in this
case again it's asking us about security
so if we were trying to build private
fields we could then associate hey we
only want to make this visible to
certain profiles I know it's a lot of
jargon to begin with right now but all
you really need to know is every user
that lives within your Salesforce
organization is associated with some
security profile so you can turn fields
on and off for individual people if you
want and for now we can just just leave
it a default
yeah it's just us the last step of the
process do we want to add it to a page
layout so really all this means is do
you want to put this field onto the page
automatically so that form we were just
on where we saw cloud stock last
modified by created by it's adding it
into that late oh yeah I totally want it
okay good
so check save alright alright we've got
our festival custom object and you've
got a custom field that says start date
right that's cool
we're looking at right now is the setup
screen for our object itself we can see
the standard field so those are the
things that we saw automatically already
and then we can add more custom fields
or any sort of customization around our
custom object here okay I guess makes
sense at an end date next yeah so let's
just keep going down the line and adding
more fields</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
