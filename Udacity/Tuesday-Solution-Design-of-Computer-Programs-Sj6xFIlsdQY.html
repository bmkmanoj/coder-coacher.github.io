the result comes out 13 27th Wow where
did that come from so that's surprising
first of all it's not a third which you
might have thought should be the answer
if you believe the argument that Tuesday
doesn't matter and secondly not only is
it not a third but it's much closer to a
half than it is to a third so just
having the birthday there really change
things a lot how did that happen well I
wrote up a little function here to
report my findings and here's its
arguments you can give it a bunch of
cases that you want that you care about
the predicate that you care about and
whether you want the results be verbose
or not and just prints out some
information and by the way as part of
this I also looked at the question of
what happened what's the probability two
boys given that there's one boy born in
December so I threw that in as well
here's the output I get two boys given
one boy is a third two boys given at
least one boy born on any day is still a
third and porn on Tuesday is 13 27th
sanborn in December's 2347 now I can
turn on the verbose option to report in
that case here's what I see the
probability of two boys given at least
one boy born on Tuesday 1327 and here's
the reason least one boy born on Tuesday
has 27 elements and there they are and
of these 13 or two boys and there they
are and so you can't really argue with
that you can go through and you can make
sure that that's correct and you can
look at the other elements of the sample
space and say no we didn't miss any so
that's got to be the right answer it's
not quite intuitive yet and I'd like to
define my report function so that it
gives me that intuition but right now I
don't have the right visualization so
I've got to do some of the work myself
and here's what i came up with we still
have the four possibilities that we
showed before but now we're interested
not just in boys we're interested in
boys born on tuesday so there's going to
be some others over here where there's a
boy born on Wednesday along with some
other partner you know maybe a boy born
on Saturday but we aren't even
considering them we throwing all those
out we're just considering the ones that
match here and like before we draw two
circles one of the right hand side
the event of the conditional probability
and so how many of those are there well
there's seven possibilities here because
the boy has to be born on Tuesday
there's only one way to do that but
there's seven ways for the girls to be
born so the seven elements of the sample
state they are likewise seven elements
over here now how many elements over
here well here either one of the of the
two can be a boy born on Tuesday so
really we should draw this state as
either a boy born on Tuesday followed by
another boy or a boy followed by a boy
born on Tuesday and how many of those
are there well there's seven of these by
the same argument we used in the other
case and of these there's also seven but
now I've double counted because in one
of these 14 cases is a boy born on
Tuesday followed by a boy born on
Tuesday so I'll just count six here and
so now it should be clear 7 14 21 6 27
there's 27 on the right hand side and
then what's the probability of two boys
given this event of at least one boy
born on Tuesday well two boys that's
here so it's 13 out of 27 so that's the
result seems hard to argument with both
the drawing it out with a pen and the
computing worked out to the same answer
now why is it that we have a strong
intuition that knowing the boy born on
Tuesday shouldn't make any difference I
think the answer is because we're
associating that fact with an individual
boy we're like taking that fact and
nailing it on to him and it's true if we
did that that wouldn't make any
difference but in this situation that's
not what we're doing we're not saying
anything about any individual boy if we
did that the computation wouldn't change
rather we're making this assertion that
at least one was born on Tuesday not
about boys but about pairs and we just
don't have very good intuitions about
what it means to say something about a
pair of people rather than about an
individual person and that's what we did
here and that's why the answer comes out
to 13 27</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
