suppose that our picture actually was
able to walk the batter so now there are
runners on the first second and third
basis not just on the second and third
base is but one on fast also so a
picture succeeded in accomplishing this
goal in the last shot so the current
situation then is discard but this side
of percepts and this goal the contents
of the working memory have just changed
of course the production rules capturing
the procedural knowledge have not yet
changed so these are exactly the same
productions that we had previously only
the contents of the working memory has
changed we now have a runner on the
first as well as a secondary third now
this exercise is very interesting
because it will lead us to a different
set of conclusions given the set of
percepts in this goal and a set of
production rules what operator do you
think the pitcher will select</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
