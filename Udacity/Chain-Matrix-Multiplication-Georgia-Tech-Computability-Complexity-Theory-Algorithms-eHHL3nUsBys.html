we'll be able to tackle with the dynamic
programming paradigm chain matrix
multiplication we are given a sequence
of matrices of size M 0 by M 1 M 1 by M
2 and so forth and we want to compute
the product a1 through a n efficiently
note how the dimensions here are
arranged so that such a product is
always defined the number of columns in
one matrix always matches the number of
rows in the next first recall that the
product of an M by n matrix with an N by
P matrix produces a matrix that is M by
P and that the cost of computing each
entry is n each entry can be thought of
as the dot product between the
corresponding row of the first matrix
and the corresponding column of the
second both these vectors have n entries
in total we have about n times M times P
additions and as many multiplications
next recall that matrix multiplication
is associative thus as far as the answer
goes it doesn't matter whether I
multiply a and B first and then multiply
that product by C or if I multiply B and
C first and then multiply that product
by a the product of all these three will
be the same but the number of operations
may not be let's see this with an
example
we'll take matrices with these
dimensions here and count the number of
multiplications using both these
strategies if we multiply a and B first
then we spend 50 times 20 times 50
computing a B this matrix will have 50
rows and 50 columns so its product with
C will take 50 times 50 times 1 for a
total of 50 2500 on the other hand if we
multiply B and C first this cost 20
times 50 times 1 this produces a 20 by 1
matrix and multiplying it by a costs 50
times 20 times 1 for a total of only
2,000 a big improvement so it's
important to be clever about which order
we choose for multiplying these mate
