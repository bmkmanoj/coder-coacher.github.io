because this is an or as soon as we see
that a is true we can go ahead and write
down true for all these when a is false
we just need to evaluate B or C when B
is true we know it's already true and
then if B is false we need to look at C
if C is true then it's still true and if
C is false then all three or faults and
that's the only time its faults over
here we move the parentheses but really
we're not changing what we do we can
think of it as starting at the bottom
with C being true anytime see is true
the entire thing is true so to see is
true here here here and here if that
evaluates the faults we need to look at
a or b and so on so we end up doing the
exact same process that's good David and
this property is called The Associated
property The Associated property simply
says that we can change the location of
the parentheses here a or parentheses B
or C failing to disclose it has the same
value as a or b parenthesis close or C
so that we can change location dependent
to seize the same what I've been true of
these were both conjunctions if it was a
conjunction parentheses be conjunction c
or a conjunction be injunction see it
would have had the same values the
difference between these formulas and
the ones we were doing before are the
values of these operators associative
property works when it's both oars or
both ends distributive property worked
when they were as a mixture of operators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
