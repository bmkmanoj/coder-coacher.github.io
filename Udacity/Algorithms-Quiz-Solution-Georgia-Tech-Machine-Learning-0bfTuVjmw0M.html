answer I do so if you hadn't said yeah
up until the very end I was thinking
along a different line so if it's the
case that we just want to choose if this
F thing that is scoring is say constant
then choosing the best subset is easy I
can just choose any subset I want but
you said then it could actually be
arbitrary and it is unknown so the only
way that I can know that I have the best
scoring subset is if I try all the
subsets and there's an exponential
number of subsets so I'm going to I
would go with exponential that's correct
exactly what is the form of the
exponential oh I want to say and choose
M yeah but you don't actually even know
what M is in term is n choose M is right
and it gives you an exponential good all
right thanks very much but the other way
is if you don't know what M is before
you start then it's just 2 to the N it's
hard for me to imagine what that means
given that you paint that part of the
input
if you mean just the best subset then
yeah there's 2 to the N subsets I agree
so either ones fine because it gives you
the same answer sometimes we say we want
half as many or we want no more than
half as many and sometimes we say we
don't know what the best subset is you
figure it out so this becomes like a
kind of clustering problem in its own
way except you don't know what K is but
the other way of thinking about this is
that of course this problem is hard of
course it's exponential it is
effectively an optimization problem over
a set of arbitrary discrete variables
that's how I was thinking about it
because we always seem to come back to
that right and in fact this problem is
known to be np-hard and it's exactly
because you have to find all possible
subsets and it maps to 3sat I will not
prove that but it does turn out that
this is in fact exactly the hard problem
that you think it is so given this and
and by the way of course of course this
problem is hard because if this problem
weren't hard then most of machine
learning would be pretty easy so it's
not that big of it it's not that it's
not that surprising that the problem is
difficult so the real question we have
in front of us is given that we've got
yet another really difficult problem in
fact a difficult optimization problem
how might we go about tackling it and it
turns out that there are two ways in
general that people try to approach this
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
