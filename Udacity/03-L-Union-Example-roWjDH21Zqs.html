data sets customer data from 2010 and
customer data from 2011 and we want to
create one data set with all the
customers for both 2010 and 2011 however
you don't always get data sets in the
exact same format sometimes they have
different field names and sometimes they
have extra fields that don't exist in
all the data sets notice that in the
first data set we have the fields ID and
name yet the second data set has a
different name field called full name
and an additional field called phone
we're going to union these data sets
together even though they have different
field names and an extra field that are
not common to both datasets to do this
we simply drag in the Union tool
bringing it close to the customer data
2010 data set so that it attaches to
this data set first then we manually
draw connection from customer data 2011
data set to the Union tool the Union
tool can have unlimited inputs into it
so you can Union more than just two data
sets now we can configure the tool
coming to the configuration area on the
left it says auto configure by name up
at the top this is the default way of
configuring the Union tool when we run
the workflow and we look at the output
we can see that the data in the ID field
is lined up but the data in the name
field is not as there are both name and
full name fields containing name
information to get the fields to line up
better we choose manually configure
fields then we click on full name we
click on the arrow moving it to the left
so that it's now lined up with the name
field and then to remove the gap between
these two fields we select phone and
click on the left arrow again to move
that field over when we run the workflow
you can see all of the names
in the name field now and all the fields
lined up as expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
