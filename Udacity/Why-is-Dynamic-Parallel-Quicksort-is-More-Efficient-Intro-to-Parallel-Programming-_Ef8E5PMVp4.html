that is actually not true we have not
been touching the partition function the
partition function does not have
anything to do with the dynamic launches
that I can do the recursive parallelism
launching on the fly however yes that
does substantially contribute because I
don't have to keep returning back to the
CPU to do my launch for me that means
I'm communicating less data and it means
that my launch occurs immediately that I
need it instead of waiting around until
that particular wave of launches has
finished simpler code while convenient
and I can probably maintain it faster is
not the reason why it actually runs any
faster and finally greater GPU
utilization is probably the cause for
the greatest of speed ups by launching
on the fly I'm making sure all my GPU is
always busy so when one partial sort
finishes it creates two more immediately
keeping my GPU fully stacked up and busy
with work it streams more work through
my GPU at one time and my sort ends up
faster end-to-end in fact when I've
written this program in dynamic parallel
form and in host launched form I see it
pretty much exactly factored to speed up
between the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
