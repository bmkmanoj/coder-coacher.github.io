comparisons we want to use them to make
decisions to make our code do something
different depending on the result of the
comparison the way to do that is to use
an if statement the structure of an if
statement is we have the keyword if
followed by a comparison we'll call that
the test expression followed by a colon
and then inside the if we have the block
and the block is the code that will run
when the test expression is true if the
test expression doesn't evaluate to true
then the block doesn't execute and as
with the procedure definitions we know
the end of the if because of indentation
all the statements inside the block are
executed only when the test expression
is true the next statement that's not
indented is going to be executed whether
or not the test expression is true so
here's an example of the procedure that
uses if we can define a procedure
absolute it takes one input which is the
number inside the body of absolute we're
going to use an if statement we'll use
an if test where we're testing if the
value of x is less than zero so that's
the test expression we have the if
followed by the test expression X is
less than zero in the block we're going
to have one statement which changes the
value of x to be negative x the next
statement which will happen after the F
whether the test was true or false will
return X so what this does is gives us
the absolute value of the number that's
passed in if the number that's passed in
is negative we take its opposite and we
use this negation and then we return if
the number is positive this test will be
false so we don't execute the block that
changes the value of x to its negation
we'll go right to the statement that
returns X so now it's time for a quiz to
see if you understand how to use F and
can use it to define a procedure your
goal for this quiz is to define a
procedure called bigger that takes in
two numbers as the Thin puts and it
outputs the greater of the two inputs so
here a few examples if the inputs are
two and seven the greater input is seven
and the output should be seven if the
inputs
our three and to the greater input is 3
and so that which should be three if the
two inputs are the same say 3 &amp;amp; 3 the
output should be 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
