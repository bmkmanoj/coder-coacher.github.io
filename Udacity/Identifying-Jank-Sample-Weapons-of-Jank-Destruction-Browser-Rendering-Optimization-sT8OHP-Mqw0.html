example this is a weight tracker app I
built a while ago and I noticed that
when I open the menu on the left hand
side that it sticks and Jencks watch so
now with the time line open I'm going to
see if I can find out what the cause is
the first thing I'm going to do is
refresh the page just so that I know
I've got a fresh start
no what I'm gonna do is hit record come
over here and bring out the menu and
stop recording immediately I see that
there are three big spikes of yellow
here so I'm going to select one of those
and I realize that I am spending a lot
of time in JavaScript once you've zoomed
in you can also get details of what's
going on in those frames let me start by
dragging this up a little bit more so we
can see it you can see what it is how
long it's spent working when it started
and a little bit more about how it's
broken down the time itself and any
child records
lastly you find out where the task was
triggered in your code the details will
differ depending on the kind of record
you're looking at for example
recalculate style tells you the number
of elements that were affected as does
layout width layout we see the tree size
the scope where it started and in this
case we also see an additional warning
which we'll talk about in a little bit
lastly we see where in the code we
triggered layout in this case though
I'll be most concerned about these yet
laden in this case though I've been most
concerned about these large yellow
blocks they seem to be what's causing me
to stop hitting 60 frames a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
