patient specified restrictions is the
most attractive privacy consent model
but how do you actually manage it how do
patients indicate what data they want to
share or not share providing a mechanism
is the data segmentation problem suppose
for example the patient had hypertension
and depression among their medical
problems their hypertension is not well
controlled and they have undesirable
side effects from the drugs prescribed
to treat it so they are interested in
joining a clinical trial for a new and
promising medication as a result they
want to share the hypertension part of
their data to apply for the trial but
they are sensitive about their
depression and wish to restrict access
to that data how do they specify that
the solution is easier of someone with
clinical expertise and their trust such
as their physician does it for them but
suppose the patient has their record in
a PHR and wants to apply for the trial
themselves presented with a list of
their own medications they may not
recognize the names or know for sure
which ones or for what condition that
form of sharing would be greatly
facilitated if their PHR or EMR
understood these clinical relationships
here's a simple depiction of just such a
record for our hypothetical patient from
dr. Jonathan nebeker at the University
of Utah in the youto r-va given this
underlying representation of
relationships the patients could simply
click on hypertension and see the
related medications with the others
greyed out greatly facilitating the
opt-in with patient specified
restrictions model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
