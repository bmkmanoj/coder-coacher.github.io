of the class for me to actually show you
how to find the direction of maximal
variance it involves some linear algebra
which isn't too difficult but we're not
going to get into here but if you're
willing to believe me that the principal
component the direction of maximal
variance can be found I can justify to
you that that's the directions going to
minimize the information loss now let's
look at the neighborhood information for
our housing data this is my data that I
have available to me on one axis I have
the number of safety problems in a given
neighborhood on the other axis I have
the school ranking of that neighborhood
and I'm going to use PCA to combine
these two features into a single feature
that I'll say is roughly gauging the
quality of the neighborhood so just by
visually inspecting the data we can see
that something like this red line is
going to be the principal component then
when I project down the two-dimensional
points onto this one-dimensional line
I'm going to be losing information and
the amount of information that I lose is
equal to the distance between a given
point as it existed in this sort of 2d
space and its new spot on the line so
for this blue point here an amount of
information that's roughly equal to the
the length of this yellow line is the
amount of information that I lose so
here's a little quiz to make sure you
understand I'm circling a point in green
here and this point is going to be
projected down onto the principal
component as well like all the other
points in this data set eventually so my
question for you is how much information
are we going to be losing when we
perform that projection of this point is
it going to be more or less or about
equal to the amount of information
that's lost on our original point this
example that I just showed you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
