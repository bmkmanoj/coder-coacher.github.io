you what is the algorithm that I propose
that Dave should use it's a very simple
one actually the algorithm is now quite
simple to describe of course it takes a
bit more effort to actually implement it
but given any graph the first step that
we do is we calculate a minimum spanning
tree for that graph and that is
something if you have had an algorithms
class you know to be doable in
polynomial time so that can be done you
know of n squared time for an N vertex
graph and then you take a walk along the
tree and there yeah you can you can
guess that that can be done in
polynomial time as well so the running
time of this algorithm here in total so
it's a polynomial time algorithm now
where I probably need to convince you is
that this is actually a good
approximation algorithm because it
sounds so simple again doesn't it so my
claim now is as I've written here that
this is an approximation algorithm for
shortest tour actually it's a constant
factor approximation algorithm for that
problem so how come well since you
already saw one constant factor
approximation algorithm I am actually
going to let you figure this out so
let's start out by taking two numbers
and comparing them the first number is
the weight of the minimum spanning tree
and by white I simply mean if you take
the sum over all edges that are in the
spanning tree that's what I will call
the weight of the spanning tree and the
second one is going to be the length of
the shortest tour for the network now
first of all I would like you to tell me
what you can say about these two numbers
how do they compare is the weight of the
tree smaller than the length of the
shortest tour is it smaller than or
equal to the length of the shortest tour
are both the same value or is the weight
of the tree larger than or equal to the
length of the shortest tour or is it
always larger than the length of the
shortest tour so please select which one
is correct here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
