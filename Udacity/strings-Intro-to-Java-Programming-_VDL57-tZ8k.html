method returns the number of individual
characters in this string there were
seven the substring method extracts a
substring that sits inside the bigger
string in our case it extracted this
string whenever you want to extract sub
strings you have to understand how the
positions in a string a numbered in Java
the initial position is zero that may
sound strange but it's actually pretty
useful and then it goes from there the
string has length seven and the
positions in it are zero one two three
four five six that's seven positions now
in the substring here you see this 3
here that is the position of the first
character that we want to include in the
substring the seven here is the first
position that we don't want to have any
more we don't want position 7 in fact
there is no position 7 we want the ones
from 3 to 6 that sounds a bit odd to
most people when they see it the first
time but there is an advantage when you
subtract these two numbers 7 minus 3
that's 4 and that's the length of the
substring that you're extracting the
next method here the index of method
finds the position of a given character
so over here I want to know where does
the C occur for the first time and it'll
go through and say that's at position 3
and finally you've already seen this
plus operator in lesson 2 it takes two
strings and glues them together or as we
like to say in programming ease it
concatenates them so here it's the
concatenation of hello and Udacity
notice there's no space in between
because there was no space in either
this or that string if you wanted a
space you'd have to add a space strings
are really useful when you work with
text sarah has a couple of nifty
exercises prepared for you where you get
to work with a rather long text and take
it apart and put pieces back together by
using some of the string methods that
you've seen here enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
