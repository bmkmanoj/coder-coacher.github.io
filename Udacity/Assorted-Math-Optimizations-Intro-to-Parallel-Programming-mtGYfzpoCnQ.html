math instructions take different amounts
of time and this topic gets maybe half a
ninja you can go really deep
understanding the latencies involved in
different math optimizations but there's
a few general principles that probably
everybody should keep in mind so the
first to keep in mind is use double
precision only when you really mean it
64-bit math is slower than 32-bit math
but it's easy to forget that
floating-point literals like 2.5 here
are interpreted as FP 64 unless you add
the F suffix therefore this statement on
the Left will take longer to execute
than this one on the right it's a subtle
distinction and clearly sometimes you
need to use double precision but if
you're concerned about performance and
you're trying to squeeze the last few
percent out of your kernels only use it
when you're absolutely intending to use
it a second math oriented optimization
is to use intrinsic swen ever possible
for common operations CUDA supports
special versions of many common math
operations like sine and cosine and
exponent that are called intrinsics
these built-in functions achieve two to
three bits less precision than their
counterparts in math dot H but they are
much faster
there are also compiler flags for fast
square root fast division 0d norms and
so forth and you can see the programming
guide for more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
