function out of my head however there's
considerable research about how to
capture brdf from materials and how to
make functions to compactly represent
them brdf SAR just the start there's
also the bsd f the beet sugar
development foundation we're more
interested in the bi-directional
scattering distribution function this
type of function captures both how light
reflects from and transmits through
material there's also the BSS RDF which
stands for bi-directional surface
scattering reflectance distribution
function save that one three times fast
this function is important for materials
like marble and milk for these materials
in particular the light enters one
location on the surface bounces around
inside the material and comes out
somewhere nearby one other extremely
important material that has this sort of
scattering is skin getting skin to look
good for interactive rendering can be
quite involved but the results are more
convincing than using some simple
reflection model see the additional
course materials for more information
that said the key factor here is scale
the effect of subsurface scattering
lessons as the viewers distance from the
object increases close up a photon might
exit at a location that's a fair number
of pixels away from where it entered the
surface from farther away there may be
no change in pixel location in fact the
diffuse component for all nonmetallic
materials comes from subsurface
scattering
it's just that in many cases the
scattering is over an imperceptibly
small distance middles themselves are
essentially all specular let me say that
again because all this time we've been
living a lie metallic objects have no
lambertian diffuse term well not a lie I
just like being dramatic really diffuse
is simply an approximation of which we
should be aware using it's fine even
high quality applications do so it's
quick to compute and looks plausible in
reality metals can indeed be given a
roughened surface to give them a glassy
or diffuse look so a diffuse term is
fine however on an atomic level metallic
objects have a free-floating soup of
electrons on the surface which absorbs
and re-emits incoming photons if your
surface represents a shiny metal you
probably don't want a diffuse term
insulators have a diffuse term because
the photons undergo subsurface
scattering most of the time the entry
and exit points are so close together it
doesn't matter but the direction of exit
certainly does material such as that in
an unglazed clay pot concrete and even
moon itself are rough enough that the
lambertian reflection model doesn't
capture them fully this again turns out
to be a matter of scale having to do
with the relationship of surface
roughness with subsurface scattering
admittedly trying to capture all of
these effects leads to a lot of work and
possibly inefficient shaders these
subsurface scattering renderings are
from 3d studio max and rendered offline
not at interactive rates the main thing
is to realize we don't have to stick
with illumination models from the 1970s
because of inertia or ignorance using
reflection models based on how the real
world works has a number of advantages
first and foremost if everything is
properly modeled your virtual world acts
like the real world change lighting
conditions and you don't have to tweak
material settings to look good for a
design software this assurance can mean
that you can trust what you see on the
screen to have some relationship to what
you manufacture physically based
rendering is also a great help to
virtual world content creators such as
game and filmmakers it's a time saver to
have predictable illumination models as
the artist does not have to learn
obscure sliders that have no real-world
counterparts it's vastly reassuring
knowing that materials won't show some
glitch from a certain angle and knowing
that lighting can be changed without
destroying the sense of realism rather
than limit creativity a well-designed
system makes for a more productive and
unrestricted environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
