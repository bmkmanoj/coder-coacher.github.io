first thing we do is we set a variable
called rules applicable to be true and
this is so that we know when we can
continue applying the given rules and
that way we know when we can simply be
done with the function and we also give
a temporary assignment to all of the
variables of none since we haven't
assigned them either true or false
values yet now in this loop while we can
still apply rules we first set rules
applicable to false and that so that
unless we come into a situation where we
might be able to apply the rules again
we just assume that this is the last
time we're going to be able to do this
now we first deal with single occurrence
variables so we set a counter to be zero
for each of the variables here and we
also set the variable setting to none
for each of the variables and then for
each of the clauses and each variable in
each Clause we set the absolute value of
the variable and then we increment
variable counter of that variable by one
since we've seen that variable now and
we set this variable to one if there is
greater than 0 or 0 otherwise that is we
set it to one or zero to represent true
or false if it is positive or negated
now we enumerate all of the variable
counters with I and ver and if there
does not equal 1 then we go ahead and
just continue and if our temporary
assignment is not none that is it's
already been assigned to something we
also continue otherwise we fall through
and we set the current temporary
assignment to be the current setting of
the variable from here we try to deal
with single variable clauses now for
each clause in the list of clauses we
first check that the length of the
clause is not 0 if the length of clause
is greater than 1 we go ahead and just
continue through the loop we don't need
to check any further otherwise we set
the variable equal to the only element
in the list in the clause and we set a
ver to the absolute value of that
variable now if the temporary assignment
of a ver is not none if it's already
assigned to something then if the
temporary assignment of a ver
it's not equal one if the variable is
greater than 0 r l 0 then we return 1
negative 1 and this is because that
means that the variable cannot be
satisfied this clause in fact cannot be
satisfied and if not then we go ahead
and fall through and we set the
temporary assignment of this variable to
one if the variable is greater than 0
and L 0 now we need to go ahead and
clean up all of these clauses in order
to do this we're going to accumulate all
of the current clauses into a new list
of clauses so that we can remove the
ones that we don't need to worry about
anymore now we are enumerate all the
current clauses and we also enumerate
all the variables in each clause and we
set the assignment equal to the
temporary assignment for each of these
variables if the assignment is none then
we go ahead and append that variable to
the new clause because we still haven't
determined what it should be otherwise
we say that well we might be able to
continue applying rules here because
we're about to remove some clauses now
if the current variable is assigned true
one and the variable is greater than
zero or the assignment is false zero and
the variable is less than zero that is
its negated then we can go ahead and
remove the entire clause so we set this
new clause an equal to none and we
continue on otherwise well then we just
have to remove the variable and we pass
through now if the clause could not be
satisfied then if the new clause is the
empty set then we go ahead and return
one negative one to indicate they cannot
be satisfied now if the claws instead is
greater than zero then we go ahead and
append this clause to the new list of
clauses and at the end of this double
four loop we set the current list of
clauses to the new list of clauses and
if we have set rules applicable to true
then we go ahead and loop back through
until that is not true at the end of all
this we go ahead and return the list of
clauses and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
