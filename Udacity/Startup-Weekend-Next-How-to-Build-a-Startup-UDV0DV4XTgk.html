next well after the weekend the teams
are told that you're going to be
presenting your results tomorrow and the
types of things we want to see is how
big is this idea so you have to
understand that and this is a note for
the facilitators and coaches is while
the business model canvas talks a lot
about the business the big idea and you
need to note this the big idea is that
there's things external to the canvas
that are important for a startup it
doesn't talk about competition it
doesn't talk about market size all these
external forces you need to be asking
the team to present as well and be
constantly thinking about it market size
what we're kind of interested is this a
large scalable opportunity or is it a
hobby or is it like a lifestyle business
now those teams might decide that making
300 grand a year is just fine thank you
very much but they ought to understand
that they can never raise venture
capital or even angel investment and
that it's a nice lifestyle business
there's nothing wrong with that once you
understand that that's the game you're
in but you need to teach them the
distinction between a scalable business
and one that's a small business same for
competition competition is not on the
canvas they need to understand the
external environment and they need to
come in understanding the proposed
experiments to test each one of the
segments for customer segment value
proposition channel and revenue model
and they want to know what the pass/fail
signal is for each test and more
importantly you want these teams to hit
the ground running and so they need to
come in with a hundred plus contacts
they're going to be calling on in the
three weeks that they're in the class
where do they get the contacts welcome
to social media friends family LinkedIn
Facebook etc and since it's a team there
are multiple members of the team so a
hundred contacts really isn't that much
but spread among three or four or five
people so you need to be able to contact
them and they need to be roughly
pre-qualified so each week the team will
have homework you know watch part of the
Udacity lectures fill out the business
model canvas talk to ten to fifteen
customers and then talk to your mentor
via Skype or Google hangout
and fill out the launchpad central
software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
