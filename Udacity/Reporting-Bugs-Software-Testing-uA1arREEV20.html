about the art of reporting bugs so let's
assume that you're successful creating
some sort of really nice random tester
that starts crashing utilities let's say
for example that you want to do your own
folding study so if you recall a buzzing
paper was written in 1991 was written in
1995 then another in two thousand
another in 2006 so now it's 2012 and
it's basically time for a new one so you
do it and so what you do is you go take
whatever operating system you choose and
you start crashing software and
hopefully instead of just being happy
about what a successful effort you've
met you've had you'll report the bugs to
the maintainers so they can start
improving the robustness of their
software and so let's talk about how to
do that the first rule and its really
simple is don't report a duplicate bug
the way to avoid reporting duplicate
bugs is to go to the bug reporting
systems that most open source projects
maintain and search on some symptom of
the bug that you found and see if it's
been reported so let's say we found a
way to get a segmentation fault out of
lvm let's see if anybody else has done
that lately well okay so we only have
one report it here that's really nice so
it might be saying so what we would do
then if we want to report a new
segmentation fault to know a vm as we go
ahead and look at this and see if the
new one that we're gonna report seems to
be sufficiently different if it is that
we probably go ahead and report it the
next golden rule for reporting bugs is
to respect whatever the local
conventions are of the communities
you're reporting to so the best thing to
do here is just look for some bugs that
have been reported and see what kind of
discussions they generate and try to
take us some sort of a similar tone to
what people have already done third
thing is to report a small test case i'm
going to say here a small standalone
test case so the arm test case
minimization stuff that we talked about
a little bit earlier is really important
for purposes of bug reporting and that
should all that kind of a process should
always be part of your bug reporting and
the second Clause here a standalone test
case is also really important so this
means for example don't report a bug
that depends on some other file that
only exists on your machine because
that's not very useful to the people who
are going to try to reproduce the bug
because of course they don't have the
other file so do what you can to make
the bug report standalone the next rule
is only report valid test cases and so
this is referring back exactly to the
infant validity problem that we've been
talking about that I talked about a
number of times in the material on
random testing and I mean if the
software to which you're reporting bugs
isn't supposed to programmatically
reject invalid inputs then you shouldn't
report an invalid input and so an
example of a system is for example a C
compiler isn't supposed to reject
invalid inputs and another example might
be something like internal communication
between a JavaScript engine and a web
browser there may not be total input
checking on some sort of an internal
interface like that and so basically we
just want to be sensitive to the fact
that some systems can't do or aren't
equipped to do full validity check of
their input and those systems we often
need to make sure the input is valid
ourselves by hand of course other
systems and we've talked about things
like Acrobat Reader or whatever these
are supposed to reject and valid input
and I'm not supposed to crash some sort
of a buffer overflow evil an invalid
inputs for those kind of programs this
issue doesn't really exist the next
thing you need to do is tell the people
who are the recipients for your bug
report what the expected output of the
system was that is what you hoped would
happen if the system wasn't buggy and
then what the actual output was as I say
what really happened on your system and
so the temptation is to not supply these
things because you think that's
insulting or you think that's really
obvious but in general it's a good idea
to err on the side of caution and
include these things so you might
include a bug report to the Python
maintainer saying that when I added one
plus one I was really expected to but
then in this implementation this
particular version of the implementation
printed three the next thing you need is
to make the failure reproducible because
nothing will get a bug report ignored
faster than being completely reducible
and so you need to include things like
platform details so for example it's
probably crucial information that you're
running firefox on windows as opposed to
linux if you are trying to report some
sort of a firefox crash the exact
version of the software under test is
important and of course if this is some
sort of an open source project you've
hacked yourself before compiling you
will definitely need to include details
about that in the bug report because of
the bug is your fault then you don't
want to waste people's time trying to
track it down so summary is if we're
able to come up with good solid answers
to all of these cut requirements but
then it's a great idea to report a bug
and so let's go ahead and go do that
