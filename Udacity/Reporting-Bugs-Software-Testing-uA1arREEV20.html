about the art of reporting bugs so let's
assume that you're successful creating
some sort of a really nice random tester
that starts crashing utilities let's say
for example that you want to do your own
floating study so if you recall a
buzzing paper was written in 1991 was
written in 1995 then another in 2000
another in 2006 so now it's 2012 and
it's basically time for a new one so you
do it and so what you do is you go take
whatever operating system you choose and
you start crashing software and
hopefully instead of just being happy
about what a successful effort you've
made you've had you'll report the bugs
to the maintainers so they can start
improving the robustness of their
software and so let's talk about how to
do that the first rule and it's really
simple is don't report a duplicate bug
the way to avoid reporting duplicate
bugs is to go to the bug reporting
systems that most open source projects
maintain and search on some symptom of
the bug that you found and see if it's
been reported so let's say we found a
way to get a segmentation fault out of
LVM let's see if anybody else has done
that lately well ok so we only have one
reported here that's really nice so it
might be saying so what we would do then
if we want to report a new segmentation
fall to know a VM as we go ahead and
look at this and see if the new one that
we're gonna report seems to be
sufficiently different if it is that we
probably go ahead and report it the next
golden rule for reporting bugs is to
respect whatever the local conventions
are of the communities you're reporting
to so the best thing to do here is just
look for some bugs that have been
reported and see what kind of
discussions they generate and try to
take uh some sort of a similar tone to
what people have already done third
thing is to report a small test case I'm
gonna say here a small standalone test
case so the test case minimization stuff
that we talked about a little bit
earlier is really important for purposes
of bug reporting and that should all
that kind of a process should always be
part of your bug reporting and the
second clause here a standalone test
case is also really important so this
means for example don't report a bug
that depends on some other file that
only exists on your machine because
that's not very useful to the people who
are going to try to reproduce the bug
because of course they don't have the
other file so do what you can to make
the bug report standalone the next rule
is only report valid test cases and so
this is referring back exactly to the
input validity problem that we've been
talking about that I talked about a
number of times in the material on
random testing and I mean if the
software to which you're reporting bugs
isn't supposed to programmatically
reject invalid inputs then you shouldn't
report an invalid input and so an
example of a system is for example a C
compiler isn't supposed to reject
invalid inputs and another example might
be something like internal communication
between a JavaScript engine and a web
browser there may not be total input
checking on some sort of an internal
interface like that and so basically we
just want to be sensitive to the fact
that some systems can't do or aren't
equipped to do full validity check of
their input and for those systems we
often need to make sure the input is
valid ourselves by hand of course other
systems and we've talked about things
like Acrobat Reader or whatever these
are supposed to reject invalid input and
they're not supposed to crash some sort
of a buffer overflow even on the invalid
inputs for those kind of programs this
issue doesn't really exist the next
thing you need to do is tell the people
who are the recipients for your bug
report what the expected output of the
system was that is what you hoped would
happen if the system wasn't buggy and
then what the actual output was as I say
what really happened on your system and
so the temptation is to not supply these
things because you think that's
insulting or you think that's really
obvious but in general it's a good idea
to err on the side of caution and
include these things so you might
include a bug report to the Python
maintainer saying that when I added 1+1
I was really expected to but then in
this implementation this particular
version of the implementation printed 3
the next thing you need is to make the
failure reproducible because nothing
will get a bug report ignored faster
than being completely reducible and so
you need to include things like platform
details so for example it's probably
crucial information that you're running
Firefox on Windows as opposed to Linux
if you are trying to report some sort of
a Firefox crash the exact version of the
software under test is important and of
course if this is some sort of an open
source project you've hacked yourself
before compiling you will definitely
need to include details about that and
the bug report because of the bug is
your fault then you don't want to waste
people's time trying to track it down so
summary is if we're able to come up with
good solid answers to all of these cut
requirements ooh then it's a great idea
to report a bug and so let's go ahead
and go do that right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
