added a bunch of new hands and since it
seems to be getting complicated I
documented what each hand is and the key
point here is one particular hand or one
particular set of rankings which is a
straight that goes from ace through five
so an ace two three four five it's
almost a straight flush but we just
missed but that's not important what's
important is that it's a straight and
that the ace is low and this is the only
hand or the only set of rankings in
which the ace counts as a low card
rather than a high card and in our
program well mess that up in two ways
one is we won't even recognize this as a
straight because we're counting the ACE
as being a 14 not as being a 1 so we
won't know that it's a straight and
secondly even if we did we'd want to
count the 5 as being the high card in
this hand not the ACE we've got to come
up with something to deal with that so
let's see what are the possibilities
well perhaps we want to modify the
function straight we also want to return
the correct hand rank for this hand so
maybe we have to modify the function
hand rank and third the card ranks
probably have to change as well we want
the card ranks for this hand to have one
for the straight rather than a 14 and
what do you think about the prospects of
making three changes would you say that
that's ok because the changes that you
envision making seem to be small ones to
the three functions would you say it's
ok regardless of the size of the change
that's just the way it is we have to put
up with it or would you say we should be
able to do better and we should look for
a solution that doesn't require changing
all three functions what would you vote
for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
