random testing and what I really mean
here is advantages and disadvantages of
random testing but might lead you to
spend more or less time doing it and so
on this side I'm going to put advantages
over here I'm going to put some
disadvantages one of the main
disadvantages of random testing and it's
of course this is something we spent a
lot of time already dealing with is it
the input validity problem can be really
hard a lot of people who give up on
random testing in my opinion give up on
it too early before they've gotten good
results and often it's a simple veloute
problem that's this imp ability problem
it stops them and so the fact is there
might be some creativity required to get
around this for example mutating
existing inputs or gaining a good enough
understanding of the structure of the
input that we can actually generate
valid random inputs from whole cloth
Oracle's are hard to so again we need a
substantial amount of creativity to deal
with the lack of Oracle's something that
people often like when doing testing
does it like to have a fixed test suite
and I'd like to run it and I'd like to
know when it's done that if they didn't
get any failures they can feel good
random testing on the other hand has no
stopping criteria and so for example if
you run a random tester on eight cores
for a day without finding any problems
that applies nothing about what you'll
find in the future you might find six or
seven problems in the next hour of
testing and in the process of doing this
compiler testing that I've been doing
for several years now I found this to
really be the case I could start a
compiler testing run on for example the
latest version of GCC and llvm it won't
find anything for a long time and I
think to myself gee they've really sort
of started nail the issues and then just
do the probabilities working out how
they do a bunch of problems will come
out after a day or two so another
problem this is one we haven't really
talked about yet is the random testing
may find unimportant bugs and what I
mean by this is that since random
testing explores parts of the input
domain that may not be often explored by
real users of the system it could be the
people developing the software under
test I'm not remotely interested in
fixing the bugs that are triggered by
these strange inputs and this that this
can be frustrating but a tree that's
really just very situational some kinds
of bugs such as buffer overflows in a
web server or in a PDF Reader or
something like that almost are almost
mandatory to fix because they're so
often exploitable so those kind of bugs
so those kind of bugs really can't be
labeled unimportant by right-thinking
developers on the other hand if we're
talking about problems that really might
not come up in practice let's say that
with my C compiler testing let's say
that with my C compiler testing I
generate a c function that's a hundred
thousand lines long and it fails to
compile well the compiler developers are
almost certainly going to
nor me because people just don't write
code like that and similarly if I make
an identifier that is to say a variable
name the date hundred characters long
and that crashes the compiler they may
not care about that either and so the
general flavor of the solution to this
problem is first of all to generate
random inputs that are more like inputs
of interest so for example when we're
generating random c codes we don't make
really long functions we don't make
really long identify our names we don't
nest parenthesis really deeply and it
could easily be that these things would
find bugs but we just don't really have
any confidence that if we find these
bugs that anybody would care about
fixing them so we'd rather just not even
find them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
