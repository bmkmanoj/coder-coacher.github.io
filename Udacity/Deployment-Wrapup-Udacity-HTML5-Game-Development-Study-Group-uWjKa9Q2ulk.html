live stream and welcome here in San
Francisco to the final yeah welcome to
the final html5 game programming study
group that's it's hard to believe that
it's already done yeah lon all right
that's time in twice I know it's been a
pretty a fun ride for us and for all of
you hopefully in the room it's been
helpful as well so with me I have Colt
McAnlis hello belapur advocates Google
Sean Bennett out of course architect at
Udacity and I'm Peter lubbers program
manager at Google so before we dive into
the final study group but just wanted to
say thanks to all the sponsors that
we've had for the last eight weeks first
of all Google for providing this great
venue and the food which it's been eight
those not great meals yeah but not to
have nachos this is the best time well
that's hard hard is hard to beat yeah so
round of applause for Fergie yeah that
was a little delayed because everyone
was too busy enjoying to food is in the
man speaking of which if you are still
eating if you can take your plate
afterwards to the little trays at the
back that would be fantastic also wanted
to thank the San Francisco html5 user
group a lot of you have signed up or
have heard about this course through
them and one of the upcoming events
that's not an html5 user group event but
a public event that we're also telling
everyone about is the o'reilly fluent
conference so that the schedule is up if
you go to our SF html5 page you can find
the coupon code SF HTML 20 is 20 percent
off the fluent conference so definitely
use that code to sign up also wanted to
let you know that the velocity
conference is back in santa clara and
that's going to be at the end of june
and you'll find some great performance
talks cold will be there yet
special showcase so it's going to be a
couple of great conferences so fluent in
San Francisco and velocity in santa
clara i also wanted to thank the google
developers live network this is where we
broadcast a lot of our live shows that
you're probably aware of things like the
break point with paul irish and addy
Osmani chrome apps office hours mobile
show we have a launched a few new shows
this year so let me check it out and you
can filter that by the technology that
you're interested in so we have shows on
Android and chrome and maps and a
variety of things that you can check out
so great stuff as soon as these shows
that are live are done they become
recording so they're recorded in the
YouTube back-end almost instantly so you
can play them any time at any time zone
all right so yeah Google developers live
to set up the mobile studio that we are
actually broadcasting from right now so
that's that's pretty cool and then guys
like you guys over here broadcast right
yeah it's had more and more it takes for
Peter lubbers to haul through the car
yeah oh that's why I brought my kids
yeah so we have some some special guests
in the audience not from very far this
time but we have of course a regular now
Colts dad dad and I brought my kids
along rocky and Sean over in the front
again the only reason we brought these
people was to help us lug around mobile
videos that's right it's been hidden
little teary motives oh can we have
another glass again right great so
tonight's questions about the final unit
but also questions about anything else
if you're interested in any other
question or if you want to ask any other
questions please do so on our website on
the YouTube channel we have listed the
URL the moderator URL
that's also in the study group pages on
Udacity website before we dive into it
any further with the little story time
with Colt again Shawn do you want to
tell us a little bit about the contest
that we're running in parallel yeah so
the contest as as all of you know is to
build your own web game basically as if
it runs in a browser then it counts you
know and we've had already some pretty
cool submissions I've seen a lot of
really good ones I don't want it are
there any favorites are you allowed to
how you love to play favorite I don't
really want to do that nobody yet all
right uh but yeah I I found myself
wasting a few minutes a few min earlier
today mark more than a few minutes
because there were a number of very good
ones so to all of you who have submitted
contest entries well done seriously I'm
already really enjoying them and we pass
them around the office and I think it
wasted a lot of productivity fifteen
thousand man hours were were yeah so
congratulations i'm testing yes haha
what i really find inspiring about it is
that a lot of these individuals when the
course started were very much to the
point they were like we we know nothing
about game development and we're really
not that good html5 and then getting
submissions from them they'd have unique
gameplay that's depth and and creates a
different sense of what you're trying to
do in the design in the element it's
really inspiring to see what people have
been able to do in the short amount of
time and the data provided it's it's
humbling and really to see what the
students we've done it's fantastic yeah
we've had a few submissions for people
who really didn't have any programming
experience and just kind of pushed
forward through it and a lot of those
entries are really unique like different
gameplay elements that I just would not
have thought of that are novel and very
very interesting but that's why you
weren't allowed to and that's why I was
not allowed to enter the contest my
imagination is not there but yeah we've
had some great entries so i sat out an
email earlier today saying the end of
the contest was later tonight basically
and sports Peter and I were just talking
about it and
you don't we lose we want to see what
more you guys can do so we decided to
extend it by another week just yeah I
know there are a number of people that
were very very close yeah very close and
we're pushing hard for that so so see
you let's see what you guys do i will
update it on the website yep and i hope
next monday if that is next Monday
midnight pacific time just to be clear
you and I why yeah yeah so make sure
you're in the right time zone but yeah I
can't wait to see all the all the
additional submissions will have already
had a blast playing all your games right
yeah that's been great so okay so you
have a little bit extra time to get
those final contest entries in again
what you're going up for is a extra
ticket for google i/o also a cameo
appearance in one of the future Udacity
training courses and then a variety of
Chromebooks and Nexus 7 tablet so good
stuff for almost any in front of
different categories so check it out on
our website it's part of the university
80 honking development wiki so you can
find all the information air okay so I
want to open it up for questions but
before we do that we have that's now
become our like a weekly relation I need
to position yeah I think it's a trade
stop your story time we've cold yes yes
so the hashtag for another's stories 30
time we cool yeah i've actually been
seeing it pop up on the other I've seen
it i'm tryna be nice it was technically
really he put in story and one of the
options was story time with co really
yeah seriously
well I am I gotta come up with better
stories now yeah this is this is dead
right this one yeah it's hittable yeah
cuz I kept smacking as I'm doing stuff
fantastic so thank you all once again
for allowing me to stand up here and
ramble for about 10-15 minutes over
additional data that we find very useful
to the course itself now this week was
asset managing and loading of content so
hopefully everyone saw the unit and
thought it was very useful and
informative what I want to talk about
today is sort of a long-winded
explanation about why asset management
and loading is probably the most
difficult and important problem for you
to face in video games because after
even after you've gotten someone buying
your game it's the playing of the game
that can actually influence negatively
other users right so someone buys your
game and they're like cool they've
already given you your 60 bucks or your
buck 99 or whatever but it's what they
tell their friends afterwards about the
product that loses your social and your
viral set up to buy more of the games
and that all comes from load time and
runtime performance so first off who's
played mass effect some gamers in the
audience I like Ann Ann's hand went up I
like that yo ya no no yeah let's know
then different that didn't happen
doesn't hurt it didn't end is ever
coming yeah so uh Mass Effect was a very
successful game on the xbox 360 that
came out the first one did amazing did
gangbusters everyone loved it prompted a
second one almost immediately ever the
team went right into development the
second one came out and was riddled with
a number of problems probably the most
obvious that many many people actually
decided to point out was actually their
load times between levels in fact it was
so bad that the penny arcade com gaming
website actually did a comic about it
where they hypothesized that the entire
population of an alien species died
because they were simply waiting for
these elevators to transition between
eight feet between floors right this is
not what you want as a game developer a
publisher or marketing or any PR
representative for a game right you
don't want Penny Arcade coming out and
bashing your game because of load times
then you know the problem is there's
like three engineers they're like oh I
could have fixed that right the main
thing here is that when you look at some
of these games especially let's just
talk about console for a minute when you
look at some of these games it all comes
down to a basic graph
like this right where we're loading some
data we have to ask yourself are we done
with this has everything been loaded has
everything been processed if not go back
and continue doing it and while you're
doing this under the hood because most
file i/o operations reading off of the
disk are blocking operations we usually
have that spawn off onto a separate
thread while your main thread is
actually drawing some people on the
screen doing you know standing in an
elevator very awkwardly right and this
is basically ninety percent of my
experience on mass effect to the right
is just a bunch of people standing there
like uh yeah I was those tacos today
pretty good all right you know again
this is not exactly what you want it was
for reasons like this that xbox 360
actually came out with certification
requirements that set in there that
you're not allowed to actually have five
seconds of a paused screen even if the
user hits pause you have to have
something animating something has to be
moving so the user knows that your game
is alive it's vibrant and things are
actually a current most mostly they
actually put that in there for load
times so that while the game was loading
you just didn't see this crunky little
loading bar at the bottom of the screen
where you're just you know waiting for
data it all came back to load times with
the probably one of the most impressive
things that I saw was actually from
half-life 1 this is really one of the
first games that i saw embrace this this
different paradigm of loading so anyone
who's played half life one or even half
life 2 knows that there was this great
setup where you'd be running some people
would be chasing you you got a dude with
a crab on his head trying to claw his
way on you and then all of a sudden for
like an instant of a second you would
see this little loading icon on the
screen right and then we disappear and
then all of a sudden you can just keep
running and keep running keep running
then you know 30 45 minutes later you'd
see that little loading icon again and
then it disappear the interesting thing
was that the guys who are writing this
code knew that load times were a problem
the maps in half-life 1 and half-life
tomb were actually a significant amount
larger than any of the other game
engines that existed at the time and so
they had to take loading into account
how they did this was actually pretty
interesting well not the crap guys the
crime guy didn't do anything you just
rambled around and crabbed at people so
how they did this was if you're looking
at sort of a map from a top-down
perspective you can see that we have
some hallway geometry and when a user is
running through the hallway they'd
actually put a little physics object in
there much like we saw with the physics
unit that did nothing
except to have a collision call back
right so when the user tramps on this
wall tile or some some body in space
what it would do is actually trigger off
to the engine it would actually start
loading the next level here is the cool
part if anyone who's played those games
think back you'll always notice that
there was some spot in the game where
you were like I'm running for like three
minutes and like nothing's going on it's
just like a hallway and a left turn I
gotta go up these stairs and jump over
her legs with Linda there's no people
there's no life you know nothing going
on that's kind of what we saw here the
reason they did that was because when
you hit that trigger point they wanted
to put enough interesting data in front
of you while you're running around to
let the next level load it was actually
pretty ingenious for the time right and
then when the level would actually load
you couldn't tell because they basically
duplicated the geometry so do you just
look like a seamless experience running
through of course if you actually backed
up and ran the other direction you'd hit
the same problem right where they have
to add all this extra geometry for you
to run through and trigger the load
again this was actually a very intuitive
way to solve a difficult problem at the
time right other games had solved these
problems in different ways mostly by
saying loading you get a little
interesting screen because back then
most the people who played these games
or hardcore programmer nerds and you
know none of us really had anything
better to do during the day I'll throw
myself in that bucket too so this this
type of methodology where you're
actually going through what we call a
dungeon crawler or a tunnel shooter
works very well effectively like we
talked about last week you have some
sort of pre computed visibility network
for your entire map right so use some
sort of binary space partition along
with portals and visibilities to your
leaf nodes and you end up being able to
say hey I'm in some hallway and that
hallway can really only see the spiders
that are trying to eat my head and you
know ten foot in front of me right
there's actually a shot from dhoom 3
probably one of the more modern tunnel
crawler games with a lot of nice
graphics doom 4 by the way hopefully
we'll get out the door one day soon um
the interesting thing about the
screenshot is you really don't see far
right you're kind of going from door to
door to door to left turn to tunnel you
know if you can actually see 15 to 100
feet in front of you it actually kind of
slows down and some of those older games
because they were actually processing a
lot more geometry the reason I tell you
this is because visibility determination
and asset loading for some of these
games that are only set up in this
tunnel environment is very different
and open world games games that actually
have a horizon in them games that you
can actually see up to like 50 nautical
miles this is actually a screenshot from
one of the crisis here is a crisis if
you haven't played it a fantastic game
where you you play a badass dude who
stuck on an island trying to fight some
other badass dudes and basically there's
a lot of trees in your way and you kind
of have to solve that problem so you
know you're not making left turns and
right turns and stuff like that you're
like half this bush isn't give me a
machete for God's sake right crisis by
the way fantastic engine the Crytek
engine one of the first people that
actually introduced the screen space
ambient occlusion methodology which
actually was implemented entirely for
their foliage rendering but added the
sense of drop shadows and soft shadowing
to their environment we're competing
engines at the time weren't even
thinking in a screen space methodology
they're still trying to say up solve the
same problem in a world space so the
Krait sake engine introduced that and
it's gone gangbusters since then like if
you got SSAO you know you shouldn't be
allowed in this club tonight homie and
then a dance fight happens between
programmers and it's all crazy from that
anyhow I mention all this because
loading in some of these open world
environments is very very different the
algorithm has to be thought of in a
completely different way right a user
can actually spawn anywhere in the
environment and look around them and see
everything on the environment on the
island so how do you prioritize load
order because again remember you're
streaming data bits off of dis into ram
and this has a certain amount of time
that it takes right that hard disk has
to spin up you got to hit the head on
that get all the bits into memory and
the memory has to be processed into the
CPU this has an implicit time so how we
do this is actually a concept of what's
the what's the right terminology so we
have a priority based streaming system
that at its core is actually based on
distance so let's say we have a top-down
environment here so all of these little
boxes represent some objects in an
environment and your user spawns at the
X okay so the question is you've just
spawned in what order should you load
the assets in this environment so that
you can get to you can get pixels to the
screen as fast as possible and let the
user start playing with the assumption
that you're not going to have everything
loaded into the screen it wants right
because it may be too much memory you
may have a streaming never-ending system
well the easiest thing here is actually
say well let's let's sort everything in
the environment by distance to the user
you know add a priority to them stick
them in a queue and just kind of let
them spin up as the user walks around
you know this is fine because as the
user spawns in another location you can
sort of use the same methodology for
distance based data however there's a
little interesting hiccup in this when
you actually start going down this path
see that larger box right there what if
that's the Eiffel Tower and you can
actually see that from your first
location so now you have a piece of
geometry that's been added by artist
it's actually visible for multiple
locations but actually would fail your
distance test or better yet what if you
have Mount Everest in the middle of it
too it's visible from every location so
now you have to start asking yourself
well how do we prioritize these large
influential prefab objects over our
distance based methodology and what you
end up with is a concept that sooner or
later an artist is going to go in have
to type in some numbers into a file that
actually puts loading priority priority
weights on the objects in the
environment so they would actually come
in here and say hey Mount Everest is a
one priority you always have to load
this asset first so what happens is over
time your artists start relying on the
ability to author this loading chain
more than your adaptive algorithm right
because artists and designers care very
much about how the game is experienced
from start to finish by your user much
less than programmers we just kind of
like to effect that the algorithm works
we didn't have to do too much work to do
it so most modern MMOs will actually
solve this right because so now so now
the problem is like we end up with
artists saying hey this has a low
priority but that may shift depending on
where the user is in the environment
right so if he's in the bottom X to the
top X you get a completely different
load order how much modern MMOs do this
is they'll actually create for multiple
spaces in the environment the exact
location and what the load order is and
actually store these on disk so when you
actually load the game it'll say hey
what's my look closest spawn point
actually use the load order from that
spawn point and this will actually allow
you to bump in get your initial set of
data and then go from there so in this
setup you can actually see the location
a and location B are both prioritizing
object ID 127 which is actually the
Mount Everest object and then from there
they actually have a variation on who
loads what right so location a has 1337
at the end of its list meanwhile since
we're closer to that object in location
be 1337 loads in turn
so the interesting thing is what most
MMOs do this because you can just drop
out of a game and drop in and come back
later right so they actually use sort of
this bucket eyes priority loading order
in order to take care of that now here's
an interesting concept is when you start
adapting your game for streaming like
this where you try to get bits to the
screen as fast as possible and allow the
user to get into your game to start
playing you have to start asking
yourself well how far can we really push
this Mike one of my favorite examples of
this is actually a game called world of
warcraft anyone familiar with that it's
a little niche I don't know if anyone's
heard of it like apparently chuck norris
and mr. T and Dave Chappelle play it I
don't know who were those guys anyhow a
while ago world of warcraft proposed in
experiments and internally at the
company it was actually pretty radical
they wanted to make a version of World
of Warcraft that was free and tribal
based so they made initial game called
tri Wow try well was an initial 25
megabyte download now today world of
warcraft is somewhere on the order of
like 40 gigs worth of data right you
have to put in CD and CD and CD to
install this stuff or you know let
battlenet stream it to you over for
daytime on my internet connection so
what these guys actually said is how can
we get more users in the door without
having to go through this barrier of 40
gigs of data getting transferred them so
they came up with try Wow try well was
what if we could make a 25 meg initial
download that's all you had to download
and while you were sitting there and
basically the 25 meg was just your
character creation screen that was it
you know you sign up for an account you
go and you go in there and create your
character you spend 10 minutes trying to
figure out if you want horde or alliance
or how many nose rings your goblin
should have and all this other fun stuff
meanwhile will you're sitting around
there playing it's actually loading the
rest of the 40 gigs in the background
you don't know that right you're having
fun figuring out how many maces this
nude should be wearing right but it's
actually streaming the data and cashing
it to disk unbeknownst to you so you
continue playing through the game and to
you it's a seamless experience somehow
40 gigs of data has appeared on my
system sweet right and then you
eventually get to the end of the trial
you have to pay money but the point is
that they allow they basically broke
this barrier before users couldn't try
their game unless they went and bought
it and waited for the four-hour down to
load time now users could try it and
meet
and move forward with it right which
brings me to the whole point of this
diatribe for an html5 game developer
class you guys are generating a lot of
assets most of your games are
two-dimensional which means you've got
lots of textures lots of sprites moving
around the screen animations glyphs
particle systems sound files this is a
great statistic from the open web
forty-seven percent bounce rate if your
page isn't loaded in three seconds right
you can round it up and say fifty
percent of your users with just abandon
a website if it's not loaded in three
seconds if they don't see pixels on the
screen stuff moving around they're gone
right for game developers this is
actually pretty intense because for you
to actually stream 25 Meg's to a user
that's going to take more than three
seconds not counting all the other
additional time that we've talked about
in this course a time and time again
about how long it actually takes the
load that data into memory process it
into some sort of spatial data structure
and then put it on the screen after that
so this is actually a pretty big problem
there's many ways to solve it hopefully
we've talked about a lot of them in the
asset loading class as well as some of
the other story time with Colt diatribes
I will tell you the one game that I
think has the best chances of changing
the way the game developers look at web
game development and that's actually a
game called realm of the mad God anyone
play this I've spent way too much money
playing this game and if you're watching
this on live or whatever go spend that
much money playing this game it is worth
your time it's fantastic basically realm
of the mad God succeeds for a simple
reason it's an it's an online always
persistent mmm oh so you log in you go
shoot some stuff you run around you
level up you get some cool gear you make
a dwarf it's awesome the reason it
succeeds is the entire game is 1.29
Meg's now that's not an initial load
that's the entire game is 1.29 Meg's
okay that streams to you instantly there
is no wait time there is no load time it
is there heck I download images from
espn.com that are larger than 1.2 nine
bags right that thing takes like 20
seconds to load every time so the point
of this is that realm of the mad God
developers actually came to the table
from the beginning saying we have to
have less than two megabytes worth of
client-side content otherwise we're
never actually going to be able to pay
transfer all the bits from our servers
to 10 to 15 million clients we're not
going to make money it's not gonna be
able to break even because they didn't
own their servers there on scalable
distributed networks and all these other
things so what I propose to you guys now
that you've been through eight weeks of
this course you've seen the underbelly
of story time with Colton you know
what's out there ahead of you as you
start thinking about html5 game
development it should you got to stop
thinking about the language and start
thinking about the data this has
hopefully been the thing we've been
harping on the whole time it's all about
data transferring data caching data
acquiring data answering phones with
data haha that's okay Ann came in late
so she didn't hear us talk about turning
off her phone you know what that's it
I'm done that's all I had to say she's
on the sound unit there we go haha any
any questions over my diatribe this
evening there's a microphone here if you
have questions feel free to wander up
and ask them story time at kohls hashtag
story Thomas all right I keep saying
hashtag I feel like we heard to say that
like a hashtag I'm just gonna short it
HT that doesn't make it any but not any
but no it's not any better I lose that
really isn't laughs it's implied story
time with all okay drop drop the hashtag
it's cleaner all right so if you have
any questions here in the room please
jump up there I've got our first well
okay would there be any difference in
the bounce rate if a player was waiting
for a 2-d game versus a 3d game they
both have to load that quickly they both
have to load that quickly absolutely and
it gets even worse on mobile networks so
all of you guys in here is that another
cell phone
are you you're playing playing realm of
the man go that's right that's right
happened she's doing she's doing that's
totally understandable so early start on
the home there you go mobile mobile
networks actually have a worse problem
so anyone that's taking this class
trying to look at building html5 games
because you want to bridge them over
into mobile right loading them in a
webpage you actually have a worse
barrier because if you've ever seen it
talked to by Ilya Gregor accor Steve
Souders you know that if the active
radio connection on your cell phone has
been idle for more than 60 seconds
you're going to have a 1000 to 2000
millisecond startup time for that phone
to re-engage with the active mobile
network if you're on if you're not on
Wi-Fi and get that data off the net
that's two seconds you're already losing
so if a user tries to pull up your game
and there it radio connection has
already been idle and they're not on
Wi-Fi you already lost two seconds of
your load time yeah that's what's really
scary you know so when we talk about
html5 gaming we talk about it moving
forward and sort of allowing us to
branch out of the digital distribution
for these mobile networks we have to
take that into account is that we're
still fighting this data transfer and
network speed problem that's that's
actually in my opinion one of the
biggest barriers for html5 gaming moving
forward yeah speaking of that so San
Francisco heads will meet up definitely
check out the recordings of this talk
from ilya that was just last month and
goes into the talk where he goes into
anybody to a pretty good detail yeah
yeah if you know if you don't follow
Ilya following fall it will change your
view on developing web application play
out right and I think he's also speaking
at velocity you so once again SF HTML 24
a coupon twenty percent offer it up all
right so let's get into the questions
art if there any questions here we are
giving you oh great we got swag oh yeah
what was that question yeah we're going
to give you a swag yeah swag for
questions so you can pick out one of the
every real question one yeah
yeah real questions anyway we got a book
for you here holy expected someone to be
like how'd you like those nachos give me
a book I'm not gonna work you can pick
any of these you pouts pick one a big
one yeah put the rest on there all right
so no no he's walking away you can put
the other ones over there so the
question from service from Amsterdam
he's back can i modify the pixels of an
image object before drawing it to the
campus I've used get image data to
modify pixel colors and then draw image
again to canvas but this is really
inefficient and slows down the game
let's see so well the question whether
you can do it is definitely definitely
yes obviously but that suppose was
already doing that any any optimizations
if you can think of yeah so my
optimization that I would suggest is it
sounds like you're doing a two step
process where you have one canvas a that
you're calling get image data on and
modifying and then drawing that canvas
into section b obviously you're going to
add overhead for that middle step where
you're locking the canvas and then
copying that data so because of the fact
that the set image the once the get
image data has been locked that actually
has to go through and if you're in a
hardware accelerated path this actually
has to do a blocking lock operation to
the graphics API before it pushes that
data to the GPU to be able to use so
typically what happens is you can you
can if you try to read from that data
you get blocked on that fence right you
can't proceed any farther forward what
actually suggests is a speed up to this
is actually lock your main canvas right
so do all the drawing that you need to
do lock it at the end of the frame go
ahead and poke in the data into the main
canvas where you would normally be
modifying that data or normally be
bleeding that other image and then
modify it there now this will add extra
overhead because remember get image data
has to call that blocking lock at the
graphics API layer that's the only way
that the bit select should be
transferred to the GPU to actually be
rasterized so that's that's going to be
a slow down from a meta level up
definitely ask yourself whether or not
that that information is needed and what
it's adding to your value like if you're
losing five milliseconds of frame doing
you know five little particles shooting
an emitter you can you should seriously
way how much your artistic quality
versus bring budget is right alright
next question from Lucas from lovely
that sounds like place where they play
loves them love step down I like little
cat on the keyboard love it love steps
right there we should we show the house
and I'm live DJ oh yeah that's why
should we should have live DJ South
Africa show can I make changes to the
game made for the contest if it's
already submitted on the forum yes yeah
especially since you know the deadline
is just ended Jack so we give you a
little extra time mm-hmm I would say
look us definitely send a quick email to
Sean Bennett over here or with what you
can do instead or for Peter lubbers yeah
thank you Peter but what you can do
instead is just edit your post on the
forum and add that information it's like
I originally submitted it on this date
and I have changed this and this and
this just add it to your forum post
after that's perfectly fine okay perfect
all right from Flay's one of our top
question mmm forget where from there are
a lot of resources out there about game
programming drawing level creation that
sort of thing but actual game design
seems like a difficult subject to teach
how can one get better at game design
Wow um well that's first thing that
comes to mind is a blog post by cold
from about a week ago we clean with
great resources oh yeah yeah so there's
a lot of great resources out there by
popular request cult actually put
together gplus post a deep post post
yeah with all of those and that's been
reshard quite a bit actually I don't
think I think especially my most popular
G+ host of all time like 350 reshares
which for me is like amazing content
this king content is king yeah so a lot
of those deal with game program
programming and fortunately yeah so I
spent four or five years actually
teaching at SMU guildhall video which is
a video game development school that's
associated with Southern Methodist
universities you can actually get your
graduate degree there in game design or
game
ramming or game art I worked a lot with
a lot of the design department because I
want to make sure that our programming
curriculum was actually serving the
needs of the design department the the
best advice I can give you if you want
to be better at game design is actually
to break down much like programming is
break down what those games are doing
and try to turn it into a flow diagram
right there's actually a fantastic blog
out there that does this I forget the
name of it but they'll actually break
down the monetization strategies for
mobile games they'll be like here is how
angry birds actually makes money right
and here here is how twin tribes
actually makes money and they actually
break it down and say here's the gimmick
here's the reflow and they actually turn
it into these these nice terms the best
is on the best stuff I can give you is
right a lot story story story story
story read even more than you right
story story story story story and then
from there go through analyze your
competition figure out what they're
doing and constantly try to proof it out
in some easy little prototyping language
go download unity go download impact j/s
just just try your stuff try your data
just make make it and iterate on it and
fail fail horribly fail so much that you
get balled and jaded and have to stand
on the internet all day ranting just
fail and fail and fail it will make you
amazing as a game designer just to
continue this diatribe one of the
courses i taught at SMU was how to get a
job in the games industry this was
actually like the capstone class that I
love to teach there and and basically i
would put these students through through
a cheese grinder for you know six to
eight weeks where basically i would just
drilled them and the thing that it kept
coming back to and these students would
email me after they would go through the
ringer and actually get their job is
they would come back and say you know
when I was in the interview I was able
to talk about stuff that no one else in
the room was able to talk about and the
whole reason they did that was that kept
forcing them to iterate iterate iterate
go out and try to mimic what these
people were doing break down their game
redo the design get more data spend all
of your day and all of your night
obsessing about your goal if you want to
make games that's your goal anything
else you're doing is standing in the way
well you know except for life life's
important too I suppose but yeah he's
getting better design it's it's a tough
pal
quick quick add our question to that you
mentioned the monetization website I
think you could look that up and we
could add that too absolutely next
course email is that would be
fascinating yeah it's a great blows my
mind oh yeah yeah caption up for this
coy questions please so I apologize
affirm if if you guys have already
answered this in a previous class that i
missed or something but i was looking at
a lot of the different tile sets and
stuff that are out there for you know
free resources for people to pick up on
and a lot of the different places have
these tile sets but none of them seem to
have an associated sheet that talks
about how the tile sets are broken out
into coordinates so is there's like some
magic I'm missing or do people just pull
up Photoshop and start dragging
coordinates and making their own lists I
mean I don't know I mean like the tiled
tool that we have for this class like it
does that it spits it out in JSON it's
nice but are these things they just say
ha here's the picture we're not going to
give you all the numbers and you know go
suffer or is there something else out
there um and yeah that much so what's
the stuff you get for free is not super
uber hyper or they will align themselves
to grids like regular grids and assume
that you understand that if this thing
takes four by four okay but they're most
people if it's any more complex than
that they go in and they just dragged
coordinates through the process
unfortunately what what I do for a lot
of my prototyping stuff is I actually
used the tiles from the I think it's
lost tree david dave' utterly ethical
ease his stuff is really top-notch it
city get an SVG format or PNG or even
swift format and i think he had like a
silverlight version silverlight was
actually a thing yeah but but I use I
use his stuff or I actually just go rip
them from other games and just use them
for prototyping okay that's what I was
doing I just wonder if there was a
better solution thank you
wild wild west all right is there too
much overhead to use exceptions in game
development what happens on it and try
catch block colds talk about arrays was
pure gold that mostly things like that
on exceptions or a pointer to that kind
of in travel from enroll Port Townsend
portion awesome first off thank you
golden arrays was was actually the name
of my master's thesis okay I'll say your
rock pan also my rock band yeah golden
arrays calm go buddy right so there
there so the problem would try catch
blocks is that we really don't have a
good understanding of how to handle
errors correctly in JavaScript I think
that's one of the fundamental problems
is there's really no good reporting
structure you know like hey an error has
occurred throw it up to a server so i
can get into my logs so i will tell you
this probably one of the most important
things about try catch blocks is that
any code inside of the try catch block
that's resident in that function will
not be optimized i'm going to let that
sink in for a minute so any code inside
that try catch block will not be
optimized now if you actually take that
code spit it out into a leaf function
and call that leaf function from the try
catch block the leaf function can get
optimized on it own these are these are
subtle nuances on how every JavaScript
virtual machine handles these sorts of
items the problem is is that in
optimizing your code and making it an
inline path or a fast path it actually
removes a lot of the type data as well
as call stack data from the actual
function itself so if a crash were to
occur in there the underlying vm would
just be like wha I think a dog just hit
a treat like it has no idea what's going
on right so basically what they try to
do is they say hey anything that's
co-resident in the same scoping variable
as this try catch block will actually
not yield any efficient code so because
of this I highly recommend don't wrap
anything you need important inside of
try catch box try to push that as far
down the stack into leaf functions as
possible make sure that you treat try
catch exceptions as though they were
conditional statements I think it's the
best computer science way to approach it
right so put it put it in a function
nest it way down deep depending on make
it actually return a valid value
you out of the function or something
that you know bubbles up through the
hierarchy that makes sense but don't
just you know wrap your entire code in
the try-catch because then nothing will
get optimized it'll be crazy all right
any questions in the room if you have
questions we are handing out these nice
is Riley here we go yeah but me meantime
is the only Oh laughter 41 no flag today
I mean time to tell me so the original
intent of this course was to emphasize
some capabilities in html5 it's also a
free course from Udacity and I learned a
lot from this course but I didn't have a
chance to write as much code as I want
to so I have a suggestion that perhaps
there's a point in the course where
something like a reference architecture
could be put together and it really
doesn't matter whether you learn through
the course or whether you learn from a
reference architecture I think they both
have the same purpose what I might do in
the future is watch all the videos on
the course and then jump to a reference
architecture document that picks up and
say unit 6 or something and what this
reference architecture in this context
might be is a couple of objects that
were loaded from you know from maps and
atlases colliding almost like a pong
game and even things like the last
question exceptions where would you use
them and so it's a suggestion at the end
of this course to say that this is I
think a follow-on to the learning might
be saying if I want to do something well
in a canvas in html5 if I started with
this I'm going to be doing the best I
can so it's just a it's my post-mortem
you know on on taking this course for
eight weeks and I really do appreciate
all I've learned even though I've been
too busy to kind of like put a lot of it
into practice something like that might
say the next time I think of putting
something in my business app in a canvas
here's where i'm going to start great so
thank you sorry yeah take one of the
book yeah
and pass one to you oh this way yeah
look for some previous question yeah
that's a great great suggestion in fact
that was suggested by several people
including person sitting behind you I
think I think that's a great idea and I
think we're actually getting some offers
of help for this it's certainly not like
like one of the things i wanted to
mention also is like we've been talking
about this is our final study group
right but the course is not going away
yeah the course is staying tell your
friends about it and we are continuing
going to continue to improve it as well
and so some of those ideas are very much
appreciated probably I will also be
sending you a quick survey with some
ideas i'm definitely posted there as
well now i think we've covered it great
it's very good what we need to be very
clear though the course will go on there
will just be less free food yes yeah the
free food will not go on as a follow-up
to the post mortem I I did ask Peter
this question earlier but since you
brought it up when is the 3d course
coming up because that's the one that I
think we all want to do is the follow-on
to this course mmm three that's right
okay well I mean that there is actually
a 3d course up on Udacity Sonoma called
interactive rendering no 3d rendering
I'm sorry and it's taught by Aaron
Haynes who is but Eric banks is is is
the definitive source in graphics
rendering right now he publishes a
fantastic book called real-time
rendering it's like that thick it's in
its third volume any graphics programmer
I've ever worked with in the games
industry has a copy of his book sitting
on their desk at all times so Eric
Haines knows his stuff if you want to
know anything about 3d he's the guy to
go to yeah absolutely so that and that's
for you know actually doing 3d rendering
interactive 3d rendering it doesn't
cover game development but all the
techniques that you would know what
you're talking about for game universe
yeah i'm interested in the next games I
got it we'll talk we'll talk will huddle
yeah
I'm hoping that in the next few weeks or
so we will be able to at least give you
a heads up on when our next effort is on
the kickoff we're definitely talking
about it a lot don't have any specific
dates for you just quite yet but
something we're very actively discussing
right now yeah very much so yeah okay um
did you get a book okay okay so a
question from Flay's here and just take
one of these things and you just leave
them leave the other one there next to
do so can a canvas pattern fill style be
scaled without also scaling the shape
that is used to draw it that's a good
question Anne off-screen canvas has the
problem of sometimes being prohibitively
large and always having integer
dimensions that's a very good question
and I don't know how mansion but I'm not
vegan I guess I'm not sure which what's
meant by intervention so basically hit
fill pattern basically it sounds like
he's wanting to draw an arbor
arbitrarily shaped polygonum entity
right with like a path right with a fill
style that can scale inside of that hat
yeah yeah so that's that's gonna be
tricky it can be so so there's not a
direct API to do what you're asking
however I'm sure that by this point
you've investigated the concepts of you
know drawing this into so drawing your
fill pattern into something and then
actually setting your the path that
you're rendering into as a clipping
region so you can actually set that as a
clipping region and then what happens is
you draw that clipping region against
your fill your your other canvas that's
actually been tiled properly and or you
know even if it's just a small rectangle
and this will give you the effect of
filling that shape with that fill style
definitely check out the clip path clip
wrecked those api's inside of canvas
that that's going to lead you where you
want to go
that one again you're gonna have to do a
little ping-pong fill and then said and
then render but it'll look I think
patent pending action alright so this is
more of a comment thanks for running the
course guys I'm sure you have we have
all learned a lot and I have enjoyed the
lessons story time by cold is the
hashtag and a highlight I guess thank
you very much tomorrow I got to say this
is that these two guys here have
actually done more work than I have in
this entire course all they have been
lifting of taking the rambling madness
that is my head and actually turning it
into a usable course that you know over
60,000 people have had the benefit of
being influenced with has been really
good so maybe I deserves credits these
guys right so we have a another question
from the form and if you have question
here just jump to the mic no no one's
interested in other books ago that's
right yeah there's another there's one
stickers or it is your looks like but
I'm from Belgium so what would be the
best method to store assets like music
offline in a lot of browser or do we
need to support different technologies
for different browsers if you want to do
that also is there going to be an exam I
might have missed that info so let me
start with the last question so there's
not really an official exam at the end
but you still have a week to do the
contest yeah the true exam yeah that's
more important than any actual exam
you're gonna do a paper yeah actually
building something right wave on board
but just go back to the question the
first part the the storing of assets so
there are variety of things available in
modern browsers including application
cache which has you know limits in
various browsers then there is due to
bypass a lot of that people use local
storage session storage local storage
man that's also very limited because of
the size that you can put things into
music obviously being
Big Sur so if you really want to go back
far like an old versions of ie you're
going to be hitting some walls pretty
quickly it's like local storage on
things like that different browsers also
implement application cache limits
differently so for example in chrome you
can actually store quite a bit there's
actually some work on going right now on
a sort of an upgrade to the application
cache specification that's pretty
promising I've seen some of the early
work and it's all publicly available
that's quite exciting more like
programmatic axes and things like that
are being expect out but yeah I don't
know if you're going to need it's going
to be painful to store a lots of music
yeah storing storing assets client-side
right now is fairly fragmented to to put
it lightly there are three or four
different technologies that everyone's
using you need to polyfill for all of
these different technologies index DB is
another one yeah that's right on that
would also work well but again also has
limits so if you want to support
anything past you know the modern
browsers really it's it's going to be a
little painful right well that's a great
lead into my next question and that is
what's the most like efficient way to
make your music run and I saw you with
the example that you gave of the MMO if
you got some really you know really
funky music that you're putting in which
is you know what I want is to really
have a real nice sound production inside
the game to really give it a wallop
what's the most efficient way to get
that done I know that's a big question
I'd like to you know if you want the
music to load you know without any
problems and you want it to be efficient
and you want it to be
you know wrap it what would you suggest
so so I have a follow-up question there
is are you looking for this this data to
be pre-baked right so the asset the
asset creation process is someone is
recording the riffs putting through a
processing tool generating an auger an
mp3 and then that's going in the system
or are you expecting you know the riffs
to be recorded and then some mixing tool
like acid reflux as well as the timeline
into the game which which path are you
looking to uh you know honestly the
first path is is the one that's going to
be most effective for me but I would
like to have a some elaboration on both
well probably the Web Audio API is yeah
have you tried the grits like what do
you think of that like the way that it
loads music almost instantly I think
that's a good approach but I want to I
want to be sure that I have a couple of
alternatives okay so I don't think
you're probably going to do any better
than Web Audio most likely I I mean
that's really the state of the art oh
yeah audio in the web right now is still
very much being worked on the only other
real alternative is going TV audio tag
which is Brooklyn is broken basically so
I'll say this is uh let's compare and
contrast ecosystems here so if you're
writing a sound manager library for a
native application let's say using C++
typically the big burden there is how do
we get this for megabyte sound file into
memory and then the amount of time it
takes to decompress subsections of that
of that sound file into something that
the audio processing convention can
actually run with right so that's where
you're going to be losing a lot of your
time there as well as your mental
bandwidth because understanding how to
properly move that sliding window around
and decompressing some of those streamed
setups that's you're going to lose a lot
of times they're trying to get that
right especially the difference is when
you've got like a 10 minute mp3 versus
like you know something that's
fire-and-forget so you lose a lot there
now once you have that architecture then
you actually start building
game components on it where you actually
start using it you know just gonna play
this sound let it loop you know what
happens when I finish things along those
lines the the interesting part about the
html5 platform in the web audio tag is
all of that underlying stuff about
streaming buffering decompression that's
all handled for you so that that's all
off your plate you can't really get more
efficient than what they're doing
because they're already taking all that
streaming into account which again
that's that's the part you have to worry
about is how how far forward you're
fetching your window how far your
streaming your data I mean we're not
even gonna get talking to talk about the
difference these differences in sample
frequency between platforms right and
making sure that you get an accurate
tick over time right if you're running
on a Windows machine you actually get a
slower sound reference tick than on the
mac or linux box which mean you have to
resample all your sounds to actually run
a different frequency that's just
madness yeah I'm trying to avoid all
that yeah exactly stick with the Web
Audio API it's going to get you
ninety-nine point nine percent of it
over there yeah actually that's a good
thing from tony check out chris wilson's
great talks on either html5 Devcon if he
just did a great presentation that was
recorded i'm pretty sure also from even
from last year from I oh that's probably
one of the all-time greatest videos on
on web audio so if Chris Wilson yeah
videos mm-hmm thank you sure
all right when should the development of
a game be finished and always something
to add or change but the game has to be
released someday and what is it what do
you think about changing the game after
its published zeros is asking though I'm
a very good question I'm a massive
advocate of the lean entrepreneur setup
for this which is that you ship early
you iterate you get feedback and you
change your game and then in that
methodology your games never done the
game that people are playing and paying
for that's just the thing that you had
the most time to do up to that point if
you look anywhere in games industry
development Triple A games or whatever
and you constantly ask them you know
could your of game been better they
would like yeah if we had another year
and then a year later the like will of
course if we had another year it's not
the best game that ships is the game
that ships when time ran out and by
adopting sort of this lean
entrepreneurship early ship off an
iterate model you're actually getting
rid of all that fluff you're getting
your product out that the consumers
you're testing the waters you're
figuring out if it's going to fail or
succeed you're figuring out whether or
not you need to spend another 20 million
dollars investing in it or if it was
just a bad idea and you need to go back
to the board you can't that it or that
iteration and that information is so
valuable that I highly recommend going
there whatever you have ship it today
get feedback all right question for you
yeah so how soon will the unit test for
sound manager be fixed particularly
those related to load a sink starting
with quiz for and contingent continuing
to the end of the unit test for load a
sink fails for many apparently due to a
timing issue they are stuck yeah a few
people are running into this I'm
actually having a hard time reproducing
it on my machine there are some race
conditions that should have been fixed
when I talk to someone about it earlier
today but seems like it only fixed the
initial load a sink at least for them
and it's still we're still trying to
figure out what exactly the race
condition is in there I'm hopefully
going to be able to fix that sometime
early tomorrow okay that's my goal huh
question from an yeah since it's the
last one and you can say that you can't
you can't answer that this is fine too
but I'll see what you can say for html5
I mean a couple years ago it was really
painful as far as the performance and
things like that and I kind of told
people well you know flash was that way
when it started was absolutely awful and
and it got better and there's two has
been some improvement I'm wondering if
you looked in a head a bit and obviously
there's been some huge news about both
chrome and firefox going in and and
gutting some of their engines and
redoing things positive development
please for html5 and speed on the web is
that is that far enough to look ahead or
or is it going to be like maybe some
vendors like Apple where are they where
they basically handicapped handicapped
the web so that the native apps can have
the big the big foot up any any thought
on how Google or or Firefox are gonna
you know where there and I usually boils
down to money as far as where a company
is making money as far as what they want
to make a good experience so that in
WebGL is my other question obviously
we're seeing some movement some exciting
movement finally from Microsoft on that
and right now you've still got to flip a
flag in android on on chrome and
thoughts on the future of any of that
that you can talk about well I think
there's definitely something yeah hit
this this is all you this is all you
well I think definitely very exciting
news I mean it it's no doubt going to be
good for performance to have you know
different
people working together or and you know
figuring this out but I think there's a
really good blog post from arrow twist
it's actually Paul Lewis who had written
a nice article on how this will the
blink announcement will affect
performance definitely urge you to check
that one out as far as WebGL is
concerned I think I mean the way I look
at it is always a you know two years ago
or maybe three years ago but now I mean
we were looking at things like the audio
tag video tag canvas those weren't
really the only three things that were
pretty fully baked in html5 and all
these other things like you know
websockets there was like no browser
that supported that in 2008 and then end
of 2009 came this little bit of support
and now fast forward just a few years
later and you have did in every browser
right so I think it's just a matter of
times all the new and really exciting
stuff we're talking about now you know
give it a year or two and it's just
going to be commonplace right and
there's always going to be that next
thing but I think you know when it comes
to WebGL that's you know it came really
much later and it's already in a lot of
browsers and a lot of good support for
done so I I keep keeping a positive
approach anything that on to that no I'm
good how do you feel about what if you
have a question haha okay Fulop follow
up for that so if we want to write the
game which would run on last many
platforms as we could get so which
technology could we use now or should or
should not use
it's a great question I will have to
tell you this in my short time at Google
that is the most dominant question I've
received I think that there's a lot of
confusion in the developer community
right now about what the real future is
and I think a lot of individuals look to
large platform holders like Google and
Apple and firefox to kind of try to pave
the way and the problem is that I have
probable I personally have trouble
answering this question because like I
have personal bias and then i have like
pragmatic bias as well as evangelical
bias right and so the the personal bias
is that I think that I think that
there's a lot of bumpy roads ahead for
every technology and that leads you into
the pragmatic advice which is that we're
doing so much cross-compilation now that
there's really no reason to actually
change languages I mean think about it
guys we can take C++ to JavaScript C++
to c-sharp c++ to python we can take
Python to javascript javascript to C++
like we can go every direction now
especially if you look at the hacks
project a chay XE hacks in my opinion is
one of the coolest things out there
because hacks allows you to write in
some meta language and it's built into
the architecture that the whole point of
the language is to output it in other
languages so you write in hacks and
compile it and say oh by the way give me
C++ code right give me JavaScript code
give me objective-c code so it's really
the concept of write your code in one
language and get all these other
platforms and now there's tons of
problems there too because what you're
really asking is how to write an
efficient well performing program that
can interface with each of these
platforms in the right way and this
comes to the evangelical advice which is
that you're you're not going to be able
to write once and run anywhere no matter
what not because the technology because
of the differences in form factors
between each of the platforms expecting
to write something that runs great with
touch on a poor profile screen that
works in that methodology that works on
this small resolution and then put it in
a web page
you're gonna have to redo all your UI
you have to redo your loading scenarios
and then try to take that and put it on
steam or xbox 360 you can run into tons
and tons of different problems so the
evangelical device advice there is that
it doesn't exist not because of a
technology problem because you have to
seriously think about the the experience
of the product on each of the platforms
and that's what the big barrier is in my
opinion thank you one more because one
of the cross platform technologies it
doesn't get mentioned but if you really
look at any platform out there if we
look at OpenGL ES it's probably at the
heart the most prevalent thing which is
one of the reasons I asked about WebGL
because the big problem with just saying
okay just go OpenGL ES and then you have
a little bit of native and that's as
that's a beautiful fast cross-platform
approach and knowing C++ myself also
it's like mm-hmm that's very attractive
issue with that has always been how to
get that easily to to the web so that's
another thing with the WebGL I mean you
could export it to JavaScript but then
you can't really get that way so I just
don't see a total cross-platform
solution either way I mean you could you
could say if you're high performance and
absolutely go OpenGL ES and if you don't
have to be then then probably the most
cross-platform approaches html5 css3 and
and and friends thoughts on that if
you're a developer yeah so again I think
this comes to the pragmatic discussion
of like what is your goal what is your
aim right i mean if if you're writing a
two-dimensional game then then yeah
they're not going to need all these
high-performance primitives so it makes
absolute sense to write something in
html5 or hacks or something like that
because you're going to get great
performance pretty much anywhere I mean
especially with chrome 26 you get great
canvas performance that wasn't even true
a year ago but yeah exactly and so you
know give us another year like Peter
said and things change even more now if
you're going to come to the table with a
million lines of C++ code already
sitting around because of a start-up or
some other you know libraries that you
had and you're going to try to adapt
that to the web well now you're going to
run into cement
pressing questions about performance
about what your end goal is if you're
just trying to get a target web on
desktop you've got awesome technologies
like Native Client or maybe even as MJS
if you're going for that other out if
you trying to get that back into mobile
then you have to start looking at them
script in and then seriously ask
yourself about whether or not ARM
processors are going to be able to
actually pull the wattage to compete
with x86 which fun fact and we actually
talked about this at the the edge
Compton London was that actually talked
with a company who had an arm emulator
that was running arm on x86 faster than
arm execute on arm oh yeah yeah let that
sink in for a minute right 86 has had 30
years of wattage and conversion and
tooling to make sure that it just does
nothing but crunch numbers as fast as
possible arm was never built that way
arm was built to be low wattage first
and so we already have this massive
performance gap between these two
because they're serving different
masters and so I think any developer has
to come to the table and actually say
what am I actually trying to accomplish
here that's that's the most pragmatic
advice I can give everyone i will i will
go blue in the face before i advocate
for one technology as dominant I think
you have to you have to look in your
mirror and ask yourself what you're
making sorry so we got that i tried
three it's almost four out of time but
last episodes and i have one more
question you guys aren't gonna wear some
worthy anyway audience lemme know what
are any build libraries too fast
variable from JavaScript Python kind of
almost in line with what you redesign
keep hearing about Ajax and its
compatibility issues is there anything
else we could use would it be possible
to get a quick example of it do
something this is almost you can yeah
this is almost too big we don't know if
you're running a client-side application
a server-side application if you're
talking about communicating from
javascript in the browser to Python
running on App Engine or if you're
talking about like a vm running on a
local machine you feel free to send me
an email well i'll be happy to answer
this offline okay two questions the JVM
does escape analysis that allows it to
sometime allocate temporary objects such
as iterative vectors closures etc on the
stand
instead of deep again v8 and utter jay s
engines perform this kind of analysis
yes yes and it does the the the dark
magic that goes under the hood goes on
under the hood of a JavaScript a virtual
machine boggles my mind and a lot of the
times some of the things that I come to
the table with with my years of
performance analysis is actually
counterintuitive right like things I
expect from the C++ world and every
other language that's like hey sometimes
manual in lining is the best way to get
performant code is actually
counterproductive in most of these
JavaScript VMs because it goes against
the grain of how they're sort of polling
analysis works internally yeah this is
one of the big problems we're struggling
with perf squad is how do you actually
tell people to write performant code
with a system that kind of moves around
and has all these heuristics to handle
all these different use cases it's it's
actually a problem to communicate right
that's yeah so you're going to write a
book cool I think it's a good idea I
don't know i don't i don't know if
there's enough demand for it I think
that's my question if you feel that
there's demand for a book about game
development feel free to email me I
would love support to figure out whether
or not it's actually worth the time
there's tons of data I think there's a
great place to be out there i think
there's tons of information i'd love to
be a part of something like that but if
anything I think it should be cold story
time story time ago that's great oh the
title and we could do it like that would
be the like hashtag story time with Colt
and then in the book you would get a
little call out of me being like that
right and they don't have like some
crazy story about the games on the
street great amazing the Greek we've got
a hit on that reads it or read that to
my kids here last question yes is my
reference architecture question reframed
here because essentially if you get rid
of the testing code and everything
and credit be rubles which is the final
question yeah right exactly yeah so
there's a lot more code from Scott
Lawrence in San Francisco there's a lot
more code in the index HTML 5 grits
what's the best way for us to fill in
the gaps to understand what's happening
to even get the game started so one of
the things is yeah so we're definitely
talking about how we can make some of
these reference examples like ideally
would have liked something to check out
for each each step of the way right
exactly but the the code for grits is
out there right so I hope that's that
was clear you can actually grab all of
that and one of the best ways is cold
mentioned earlier to really try to play
around with the stuff amend and look at
that code really try to understand it
and play around with it you think that
stuff no I think that's great I think
that actually digging in and trying to
understand something that you know you
feel kind of lost when you first weighed
in is especially when you look at my
code you can say it's a say no i'll say
it i'll refrain all right I'll I over
Frank is a great way to learn anything
rough year 00 kisco yeah I I think you
learn more when you kind of throw
yourself in there than any other time
and I think that's part of what cult is
getting at so often when he says just
you know just dive into whatever games
that you that you want to learn how
their may just dive in and see what how
it runs may see what makes it tick and
that is where you really learn yeah so
are there any other questions in the
audience going on yes all right well I
want to thank every one of you for
coming especially the ones that have
been here every yeah yeah the single
eight weeks yeah that's been great
getting to know you looking forward to
judging the contest and
kind of sad to say that we won't be back
next week no show off your Tanner's no
food here there's no more free food what
we are what i was thinking about and
haven't talked to Sean and Cole Tia this
maybe in a month or you know in some
period of time maybe not a month is
probably that's great because of google
i/o but yeah that's bad I owe the studio
another soon like an online live events
on Google developers live just where
people can ask their questions for and
then we can give a couple of updates and
talk about the contests and things like
that but will probably be doing that
from the mountain view GD else to do so
with that thanks everyone for gonna say
wellness thanks yes I do have to say
this thank you all so much for your
continued support this class it has been
humbling absolutely humbling yeah the
amount of support the feedback the
attention to detail in the dedication
that all the students put in this class
I honestly have to say I learned so much
just from getting the feedback from all
the students thank you guys so much for
allowing us into your minds and and the
ability to influence your lives it is it
is humbling that you've trusted us with
that so thank you so much i wish you
nothing but best go on make amazing
things dedicate yourself to doing
awesome and you're gonna you're going to
achieve it I've 50 thank you so much
yeah thank you guys alright that's we're
gonna close it yeah thank you so much
exhibitor right yeah
