next instruction which is a divide this
divide is going to look for this type of
a unit and find it so we're going to
mark that ml 2 is not full we're going
to say the disc has issued in cycle 5
we're going to look at f0 + f6 as our
inputs f0 comes from LML one f6 is
actually in the register file because
this doesn't say so for example if this
load has been a little bit later we
would have to wait for it but because
it's done we can read 7.1 and put it
here and then we're going to rename f10
to point to this ml 2 which is where we
put the divide and that concludes the
issue for this cycle now as far as the
dispatch is concerned we have already
dispatched this load and there is
nothing else that is ready to dispatch
so we don't dispatch anything this cycle
in this cycle this load is still
executing it's going to broadcast this
result in the very next cycle in cycle 6
and there is no result that gets
broadcast in this cycle either so we are
basically done with cycle 5 now let's
look at cycle 6 in cycle 6 we're going
to try to dispatch this ad there is a
unit available so we will succeed in
dispatching it f 8 + f2 are going to be
a d1 and LD to rename f6 to point to the
ad tuna which is where we put this
instruction and that concludes the
issuing of this instruction now let's
look at whether we can dispatch
something well in cycle 5 this
instruction is still executing so in
cycle 6 is going to write the result but
until that writes the result nothing is
ready really to execute so basically we
don't really dispatch anything but there
will be a right result by the load as a
result of this several things will
happen first of all we will deposit the
result of the load which is whatever is
at address 245 to the register f2 so
let's say that our f2 just became I
don't know minus 2.5 we can then provide
this value also to all of the things
that are waiting for LD to in this case
there are several instructions so the
operand here matches LD
2 so minus 2.5 will be captured here and
we are no longer waiting for it the
second upper end of this instruction
also matches we're going to capture it
here and mark this is no longer waiting
for it and then the first operand of
this matches it minus 2.5 so we're going
to unmark it here too and finally
because this entry match is LD too we're
going to change the rat to once more
point to the register file so this
concludes the writing of the result
remember that because now these
instructions are actually ready to go
but because that happens kind of towards
the end of the cycle we consider that
they cannot really dispatch in the same
cycle because we are considering that we
cannot first broadcast the result and
then dispatch instructions that use that
result it's easier if we then first try
to dispatch instructions and then
broadcast the result because if we now
consider what can dispatch this looks
like it can dispatch so we need to
remember that the broadcast has happened
in the same cycle and this really is not
eligible for this batch yet so that's
why we did kind of dispatch before
broadcast similarly it could help if we
just did the you know dispatch and then
issue and then broadcast just so that
you know kind of we don't consider
things that have just issued for
dispatch but that is it because only one
thing gets to dispatch and it's very
very quick so in cycle 6 we have issued
an instruction we have broadcast the
result and nothing really has been
dispatched so now it's time to consider
what happens in cycle 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
