to a few extra transforms in the chain
however object 3d is designed for
another purpose that is extremely useful
what object 3d does is create a
parent-child relationship between two
objects once an object is a child of
another object that child is affected by
whatever is done to the parent here I'm
showing a fleshed-out set of
parent-child relationships the car has
two doors and four wheels each wheel has
a rim a hubcap and a tire this is
usually called the scene graph as it
defines a graph of relationships of
objects in the scene this whole tree
structure is called the hierarchy
another frequently misspelled word so
get it right with this hierarchy we can
do a lot for example we can move the
whole car by applying a transform to
just the parent the other objects in the
hierarchy will automatically be updated
with this transform and follow along
with the body we can also affect objects
within the hierarchy if I change the
wheels rotation the rim hubcap and tire
will also be updated and move along
under the hood what is happening is that
a series of transforms are being
maintained for example for the hubcap
here's the series there's the scale
rotate and translate set for the hubcap
itself then another scale rotate and
translate for the wheel and finally a
scale rotate and translate for this car
as a whole in practice the scale
matrices are not often used as many
model creators make their models to
scale the good news is that these
complex series of transforms can be
compressed into a single transform that
does it all it holds all the scales
rotations and translations plus anything
else done will show how this works in
the upcoming lessons on matrices that
said fixed hierarchies in the
parent-child relationship they establish
are extremely useful hierarchies allow
most objects to be controlled in a
natural way
I believe I've said this three times
Sall invoke Lewis Carroll's line from
the hunting of the snark what'd I tell
you three times is true personally when
I'm thinking through what series of
transforms I want to apply I work step
by step perhaps the most important rule
I can offer you is this once you've
applied to transform forget about it
entirely that transforms applied its
history and you now have some new object
and a new position possibly with some
new location at the origin next draw a
picture if it helps I usually do
finally once a transform is applied
where does your new object want to move
from there if you find you've messed up
and the new object is not moving toward
your goal undo and try again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
