existing market incumbents exists
customers can name the market customers
want or need better performance and it's
usually a technology-driven play
positioning is driven by the product and
how much value customers place on its
features the risks in an existing market
is thinking that the incumbents are dumb
typically incumbents unless they're
large corporations that are falling
asleep will defend their turf remember
the network effects of an incumbent it
might mean that it's known about their
product but it might be all the
ancillary services and third-party
offerings they have in their catalog and
remember just as you're focused on
innovation most incumbents are focused
on innovation so before you jump into an
existing market you need to take a look
at the innovation rate of the incumbents
now one of the interesting things is
trying to figure out what sales look
like and and what's the adoption rate in
a new market it turns out one of the
interesting curves for start-up
companies is a technology lifecycle
adoption curve popularized by Jeff Moore
in a book called crossing the chasm and
more postulated that there was a gap a
chasm between visionaries and the
mainstream and pragmatic and
conservative market it turns out though
in an existing market that chasm between
these early adopters and the mainstream
is very small or non-existent because if
you're right
entering an existing market your sales
curve the spreadsheet you're putting
together for your revenue if you get it
correctly should look just like this
you're taking market share from
incumbents from day one in existing
market if customers react to your
hypotheses that what they needed was
higher performance and you were correct
this is your revenue curve
