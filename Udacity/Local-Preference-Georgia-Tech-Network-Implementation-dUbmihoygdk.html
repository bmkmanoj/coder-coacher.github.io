routes to a destination one via the AAS
path to four and the other via the AAS
path three for local preference or
simply local pref allows an operator to
configure the router to assign different
preference values to each of the routes
that it learns the default local
preference value is 100 if the operator
prefers that this router select the path
through a s2 it can configure the router
to set a higher local preference for
that route such as 110 this results in
this router selecting the route through
a s2 and sending traffic to the
destination and a s4 via a s2 in this
way an operator can adjust local
preference values on incoming routes to
control outbound traffic or to control
how traffic leaves its autonomous system
and route to a destination this is
extremely useful for configuring primary
and backup routes for example here the
route through a s2 might be the primary
route and the route through a s3 is the
backup route now typically as I
mentioned local preference is used to
control outbound traffic but sometimes
autonomous systems can attach what's
called a BGP community to a route to
affect how a neighboring autonomous
system sets local preference a community
is nothing more but a fancy jargon word
for a tag on a route so let's suppose
that a s4 wanted to control inbound
traffic by affecting how s2 or a s3 set
local preference in this case let's
suppose that a s4 wanted traffic to
arrive via a s3 its primary rather than
via a s2 its backup in this case a s4
might advertise its BGP routes with
primary and backup communities the
backup community value might cause a
router in a s2 to adjust its local
preference value thus affecting how a s
to s outbound traffic choices are made
so again local
preference is used to control outbound
traffic in this case a s to s outbound
traffic decision but the use of a BGP
community on the route advertisement can
sometimes be used to cause a neighboring
a s to make different choices regarding
its outbound traffic thereby allowing an
a s to specify a primary or a backup
path for incoming traffic this type of
arrangement requires prior agreement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
