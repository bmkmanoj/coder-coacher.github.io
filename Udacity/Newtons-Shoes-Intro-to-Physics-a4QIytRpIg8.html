don't worry if you put something
different let's see what dr. Farah has
to say there's one thing that everybody
knows where Isaac Newton that he SAT
beneath an apple tree and had a flash of
inspiration we don't know and I don't
think we can ever know whether it really
happened what he said was that he was
sitting in his garden in his orchard
where he'd had to retreat from Cambridge
because of the plague so sitting in the
orchard watching the apples fall around
him and suddenly he thought to himself
why is it that that Apple falls to the
ground why doesn't it move sideways or
upwards and is it possible there's one
single force that makes the Apple fall
to the ground and makes the moon go
around the earth that makes the earth go
around the Sun and that is allegedly the
great Eureka moment the flash of
inspiration and that's the significance
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
