this is something that wasn't covered in
CS 101 but will be used in many future
classes including CS 212 list
comprehensions are a powerful tool for
quickly and concisely creating lists for
example let's say you have a list of the
Udacity TAS like this and maybe we'll
run it right the TA names in upper case
because lower case is a little bit
boring won't waken we can do this is
with a for loop like this one and let's
see how it works this for loop is really
doing five different things first we
create the empty list bad upper case TAS
and I've called it bad uppercase TAS to
emphasize that this really isn't the way
we're going to want to create such lists
next it generates the indices and it
does that here these indices will be 0 1
2 3 4 5 because Udacity TAS is a list of
length 6 then we iterate over these
indices next we apply the upper function
and this is a function that just takes a
string and converts all of the
characters to uppercase finally we
append to the bad uppercase T A's list
and this code will be perfectly
functional but it is bad it is ugly and
it is slow which is why we have list
comprehensions and just to show that
this code works let's run it and sure
enough we get a list of the TA names in
there printed in uppercase using list
comprehensions we could solve this
problem in one line of code and here
python recognizes that Udacity TAS isn't
iterable an iterable just means any
object that can be iterated over so for
example lists can be iterated over
strings Ken and you'll see a lot of that
in CS 212 in the first unit tuples and
if you don't know what those are yet
don't worry these are all iterable
objects and this notation tells Python
to iterate over all of the entries and
Udacity TAS call each entry name and
then apply this upper function to name
the brackets indicate that we want to
put the results into a list and that's
the list that we see down here Peter
Andy Sarah gundega job Shawn and
actually I'd rather print each name on
its own line so let's do that
like this that's better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
