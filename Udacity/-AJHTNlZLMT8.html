Hinds method gives us horns estimate for
the next step and in parallel we get
Euler's estimate for free and we can
compare these estimates to find out the
error that we are making by the way the
technical term for this type of method
is an embedded rumor CUDA method if you
want to look that up remember the two
types of errors are introduced before
the one type of error that we are
actually interested in in the end is the
GTE the global truncation error by how
far are we off after a finite time what
horns method allows us is to estimate
the 80 the local truncation error the
error that we are making at each step
consider the distance between the euler
result for that step and the horn result
for that step as we saw earlier highest
result is much more accurate than
Euler's result so what we see here is
about the error of Euler's method the
LTE of Euler's method I'm cheating a
little here I must take the velocity
into account of course we have several
dimensions two dimensions concerning X
and 2 dimensions concerning velocity we
have to take all of them into account so
we need this term as well by how far is
the eula estimate for the velocity off
from horns estimate you could simply
form the sum here but that would look
strange for physicists these are meters
these are meters per second that does
not work the most simple idea is to
introduce a time in here and time of
that simulation and that make sense when
the velocity is off by a certain amount
early in that simulation that error will
grow over the course of that simulation
there's other ways of combining these
differences you could form the square
here the square there and then take the
square root but to make things simple
I'm simply using this distance plus the
simulation time times that distance we
know that the G
teehee the global truncation error for
Euler's method is a constant times the
step size one can also show that the
local truncation error is another
constant times the step size squared you
can check the plausibility of H square
appearing here if I double the step size
I only need half as many steps each step
has four times the error I need half as
many steps which means that the total
error is multiplied by two which we know
is the case what I can do now is to
change the step size s I go I do not
need to specify the step size in advance
odds method is able to estimate the
perfect step size for a given accuracy
assume that I did the first step with
some step size whichever one I chose but
what I want is that this error the local
truncation error of Euler's method is of
a fixed size let's call that tolerance
what I want is to find a step size let's
call it H nu so that this error is of
the fixed size called
tolerance which would be measured in
meters by the way with this type of
error I can compute C from that very
first step it would be the local
truncation error divided by H square
owed and I can solve for the new step
size so the method actually determines
the right step size I should be taking
given the tolerance I can solve for the
new step size and find that the new step
size is the old step size times the
square root of the tolerance divided by
this local truncation error that I can
compute numerically so after we did the
first step with that old step size we
got an estimate for a perfect step size
that would produce a local truncation
error of size tolerance for Euler's
method and we can keep doing that as we
go
the step size will be adjusted
automatically we do not have to worry
about it the method will choose the step
size for us one benefit of this method
choosing the perfect step size for us
is that we do not have to choose it
upfront the other benefit is that the
solution will be stepping at appropriate
step sizes for instance when we come
closer to a planet and the trajectory
gets more bent we need more steps this
method will automatically choose smaller
steps as we go and eventually use larger
steps again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
