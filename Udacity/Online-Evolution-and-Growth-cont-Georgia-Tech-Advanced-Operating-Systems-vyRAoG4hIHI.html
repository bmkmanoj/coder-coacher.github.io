big flip in the big flip what we're
doing is we're bringing down half the
nodes at once so in other words the
service is available at fifty percent of
the full capacity so you'll see that
with the big flip half the nodes are
down so we have reduced the server
capacity the total DQ available by fifty
percent for you units of time and the
total upgrade is going to last two times
you because we have petitioned the
entire server capacity in two halves and
upgrading one half upgrading the second
half for two times you time units we're
not going to have full capacity and
during this two times you time unit we
get the service at fifty percent
capacity and at the end of this is back
up to full capacity so these are the
three different choices that you've got
the fast reboot where the upgrade time
for the entire service is just equal to
the upgrade time for a single node but
here we don't have the service available
for any of the users for that period of
time and this might be a good strategy
for services that can exploit the
diurnal property of user community
rolling upgrade is the more common one
where what we are doing is we are
upgrading the server's one at a time but
it's going to take a long time
especially when you're talking about
data centers having thousands and
thousands of processors rolling upgrade
is going to take a long time and it
might be done in batches for instance
instead of being exactly one at a time
and the extreme of that rolling upgrade
is this big flip where we are saying
will bring down fifty percent of the
nodes upgrade them and then turn them
back on and then do the upgrade for the
remaining fifty percent so in the third
case in the big flip the service is
always available but at fifty percent
capacity for a certain duration of time
but there is nowhere to hide the DQ loss
and you'll see that the DQ loss which is
shown by the area of the shaded
rectangle in each one of these cases the
area
in the shaded rectangle is exactly the
same or in other words the DQ loss is
the same for all three strategies and it
is the DQ loss of an individual node the
upgrade time for an individual node and
the number of service n that you have in
your server form that's the total DQ
loss for online evolution and all that
these different strategies are saying is
as a system administrator you have a
choice on how we wanted this short the
DQ loss and make it apparent and not
apparent to the user community in this
case it is going to be apparent to the
entire user community that there is
upgrade going on in this case different
segments of the user community are going
to notice that the service has become
unavailable for a short duration of time
and here it's sort of in between these
two extremes and that half the user
community may see a service being
unavailable for some amount of time so
in other words using the DQ principal
maintenance and upgrades a controlled
failures that can be handled by the
administrator of a system service so
what we have seen through this concept
of DQ is a way by which a system
developer and a system administrator can
work together and figuring out how to
architect the system in terms of how the
data should be partitioned replicated
and how the system should fine-tune the
service by looking at the instantaneous
offered load and tuning whether to keep
the yield the same or the harvest the
same knowing that DQ is a constant and
the server is getting saturated and
finally when service has to evolve once
again the system administrator can make
an informed decision on how to do this
online evolution by controlling the DQ
loss that is experienced by the user
community at any point of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
