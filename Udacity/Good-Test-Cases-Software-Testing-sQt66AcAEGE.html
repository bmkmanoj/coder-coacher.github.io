and software components where the domain
is clearly defined and might be a subset
of all the values acute that you can
construct using the programming language
it's often the case that higher-level
software artifacts don't have the luxury
of limiting their domains and so one
good example of this is an operating
system so here let's say we're testing a
UNIX platform such as Linux or Mac OS X
now I know we really haven't discussed
this case yet but I want to take a
really quick quiz in order to start
building up our intuition about testing
so this example it will be a very
slightly simplified version of the UNIX
read system call and this is a system
call supported by by all UNIX platforms
so by Mac OS and Linux and and others
all the read system call does is takes a
file that's already open and read some
bytes out of it into the address space
of the process that calls read and so
the read call takes three parameters it
takes an integer called FD which is just
a small integer representing a file
that's already open it takes a second
current parameter called buff which is a
pointer to a memory region so that is to
say a valid memory region in the in the
processes address space and finally it
takes a number of bytes and so the quiz
that we're gonna take is which of the
following test cases constitutes a
useful test case for the read system
call so our four test cases are first
reading from file descriptor number one
this is always a valid file descriptor
for UNIX process from the address of B
and let's assume that's refers to a
valid memory region and we're gonna read
ten bytes the second test case is also
reading into variable B 10 bytes but as
specifying file descriptor negative nine
nine nine nine nine
the third test case is reading into file
descriptor one using a pointer to an
address which is almost certainly a bad
one this is just a random hex constant I
just made up also reading ten bytes into
there and a final test case reads into
file descriptor 1 into a valid address B
but reads - 3 3 3 3 3 bytes so go ahead
and write your answer right all of the
test cases write the letters indicated
all the test cases do you think are good
ones for a UNIX kernel in the space
