supporting hardware will be a
conditional move instruction in the MIPS
instruction set for example there is a
move Z instruction that takes two
sources and the destination register and
the way this works is that this
instruction compares our T to zero and
if it is zero then changes our D to
become equal to RS otherwise leaves Rd
alone
note that there is no branch here
anymore because this is a single
instruction MIPS also has a move n
instruction that works exactly the same
way except it moves RS into Rd only
farty is not 0 so we would implement our
x equals depending on condition x1 or x2
by doing something like using
comparisons or whatever to put the
result of the condition into let's say
r3 then r1 would be our whatever x1
expression we wanted to implement r2
would be our X 2 and then we will do
move n X r1 r3 move Z X r2 r3 and this
puts one of these 2 into X depending on
whether r3 was true or false which means
depending on the condition the x86
instruction set has a whole set of so
called
C move instructions so for example it
has seem of Z seemed of NZ seemed of
greater than etc where the condition
here is determined by the flags and all
of these instructions effectively
implement the if the condition codes
correspond to one of these conditions
depending on the instruction then the
destination register gets the value of
the source register otherwise the
destination register is not modified so
you can see how we can implement similar
behavior here except maybe we don't even
need to put the condition in a register
because probably we can just test
the condition and then doula
greater-than less-than and so on on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
