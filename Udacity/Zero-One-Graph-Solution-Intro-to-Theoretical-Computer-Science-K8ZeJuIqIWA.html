are connected well if we can access
every element of the adjacency matrix in
constant time well then we can just
check that given element in the matrix
in constant time similarly the time
required to add an edge between two
vertices well we can access that element
in constant time and then just change it
from zero to one that's constant time
and similarly we can change from 120 to
remove an edge between two vertices now
the time to find the degree of a vertex
it's a little bit harder to find the
degree of a vertex where the degree is
the number of vertices that are
connected to it in order to find all of
the vertices that are connected to a
given vertex well we have to go down
that row or that column one by one since
we have to do this end times well this
is order n at least now these questions
are somewhat tricky the memory required
representa graph with order of n edges
as an adjacency matrix and order N
squared edges as an adjacency matrix
this is a bit of a trick question if we
have n vertices then we have an n-by-n
matrix which is N squared total elements
so we're going to need n squared memory
slots to put each of those elements in
you can pare that down a little bit if
you're really clever but with a naive
adjacency matrix approach then the
memory required isn't really a function
of the number of edges so much as it is
the number of vertices so we're going to
go ahead and put n squared for both of
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
