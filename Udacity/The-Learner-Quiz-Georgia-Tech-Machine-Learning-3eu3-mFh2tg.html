choosing which questions ask the learner
is in a distinctly more difficult
situation because it doesn't actually
know what the right answer is so whereas
the teacher could ask questions that
were maximally informative that is to
say whittle down the hypothesis set to
one in a single question the learner
doesn't doesn't have that ability the
learner can't know which whether the
question that's being asked is going to
have a yes or no answer so again
assuming that the learner can ask any
question at once but doesn't know what
the right answer is
how many questions is it going to need
to ask before it can it has whittled
down the set of possible people to just
the one that is the right answer so I
gave four helpful formula here all in
terms of the number of people that we
have to choose from is do we have to ask
questions that is the size of the set of
people is it going to be more like the
log of the size of the set of people
since there's you know lots of different
ways that the person can be chosen do we
have to look at two to the number of
people or again can the learner be as
powerful as the teacher and get the
whole thing in just a single question
all right so is this a little clearer
Charles can you can you work this one
through yeah I think I can work this one
through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
