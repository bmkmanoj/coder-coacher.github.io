I want to make on final state machines
and more in general on model-based
testing the first one is about
applicability testing based on finite
state machines is a very general
approach that we can apply in a number
of contexts and in particular if you're
working with UML you have state machines
for free because state charts are
nothing else that a special kind of
state machines so you can apply the
technique that we just saw directly on
state charts and try to cover their
state and their transitions another
important point is that abstraction is
key you have to find the right level of
abstraction the bigger the system the
more you have to abstract if you want to
represent it with a model and in
particular with the finite state machine
so it's like having a slider and you
have to decide where you want to move on
that slider the more you represent the
more complex your system is going to be
in the more follow your testing is going
to be but also more expensive the less
you represent the less expensive testing
is going to be but also testing might
not be as thorough as it would be
otherwise so you have to find the right
balance between abstracting away too
much and abstracting away too little and
finally there are many other approaches
so we just scratch the surface and we
just saw one possible approach but for
instance other models that you can use
are decision tables flow graphs and even
historical models models that can guide
your testing based on problems that
occurred in your system in the past and
also in this case I'm going to put
pointers to additional materials in the
class notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
