last question let's just look at one of
those numbers as an example to explore
more how about that first one 3.1 times
10 to the 4th we can keep 3.1 as is but
we know that 10 to the 4th can be
written differently this is just 10,000
so 3.1 times 10 to the 4 is equal to 3.1
times 10,000 what do we do now well you
may remember that to multiply a number
by ten you add a zero but in reality
what you're actually doing is moving the
decimal point of the number one place to
the right when you multiply by 10 and in
some cases this requires the addition of
a zero for example if we look at the
number 31 and we want to multiply it by
10 we need to note that the decimal
point is invisible but it's technically
right here we need to move it from being
right after the one one place to the
right and since there's nothing here
right now we need to add a zero in then
we put a decimal point after that zero
in this case though we're dealing with
10 to the fourth power so what do we do
in that situation well for each 10
that's here this number is going to get
10 times bigger so the decimal it needs
to move one step to the right for each
of those factors of 10 the first time we
move it we end up with 31 the next time
we move it the decimal point will be out
here and here we have one of those
invisible spaces we know we're going to
need to put a zero there but let's not
derail ourselves at this point we've
already moved over 2 times so that takes
care of two of our four factors of 10 we
need two more there's our third and
there is our fourth so our decimal
points started out right here and in the
end it's all the way out here to the
right we went from having 3.12 having 31
to having 310 to 3,100 and finally to
31,000 this is where our decimal point
won't be long if we decided to write it
in we know it's generally invisible
though for numbers that don't have
decimals written outside of them to give
you a chance to try out what we've been
talking about see if you can write out
that number that we had at the end of
the last question 3.1 times 10 to the 21
how would you write this out using our
normal number notation not scientific</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
