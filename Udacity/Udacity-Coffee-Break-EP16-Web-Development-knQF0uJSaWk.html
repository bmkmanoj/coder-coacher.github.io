mm-hmm hi I'm Shawn bet a course
architect here at Udacity and today I'm
going to be talking about our web
development course the first course that
I worked on when joining Udacity the
thing I like about the web development
course is it packed so much information
to such a small amount of content my
favorite part of that is probably the
lesson on databases which is less than 3
in the course and the reason that I like
it so much is that really there are a
few specific things that you need to
know about databases in order to build a
blog and we managed to run through that
very very quickly and get you a whole
bunch of content we talked about sequel
we talked about how to use the App
Engine data store about charting and
replication and all sorts of things like
that just enough to get you what you
need to know there's a whole bunch of
other great content in the course
there's a lot of great interviews in the
last lesson Steve goes into a lot of
detail about how he built read it we
talked to a lead engineer reddit about
how they've built it up since then we
also talked to a Udacity engineer Chris
chew about how we use App Engine and how
it's helped us scale how it's helped us
build our site and our application in a
really user friendly kind of way so I'd
really recommend you check out that out
go ahead and like us on Facebook and
until next time Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
