five steps can we simplify it
that is can we use fewer steps it seems
that the following would work first
Alice says hi to Bob and send along a
challenge or to second in response
bob says Alice the ciphertext of our two
and his own challenge are one upon
receiving this response Alice decrypts
the ciphertext to see if it matches the
plaintext are two that she has sent to
Bob if it matches then she knows that
she is communicating with Bob third
Alice then sends Bob the ciphertext of
r1 and Bob decrypted and matches it with
the plaintext r12 was indicate Alice is
there anything wrong with this
simplified protocol it turns out that
there is a reflection attack a kind of
man in the middle attacks here's how it
works first truly impersonates alice by
following the protocol truly will be
stuck as step 3 because she cannot
encrypt the challenge are one sent from
Bob she does not have the key kab then
Trudy simply opens another connection
with Bob and again impersonating Alice
this time truly sense Bob's the
challenge are one that bob has sent her
in the first connection the one that
she's stuck in according to the protocol
Bob responds with a ciphertext of r1 and
another challenge r3 notice that bob has
send the ciphertext of r1 to Alice so
what Rudy can do is to take the
ciphertext of r1 then Trudy can now go
back to the step 3 of the first
connection and send it back to Bob to
complete the first connection that is at
this point the first connection
successfully concludes and Trudy has
successfully impersonated Alice this is
called a defection attack because truly
simply sends back to Bob Bob Bob had to
send her from another connection so how
can we prevent
refraction
tax one way is to use two different
share keys one is for the initiator of
the connection say Alice in the other is
for the responder say Bob the reserve is
that the ciphertext that truly gets from
Bob cannot be presented as a ciphertext
from Alice because these two ciphertext
should be using two different keys there
is there are two shared keys being used
say Alice used kab one and Bob used kab
two therefore the server text from Bob
is encrypted using kab two and Bob is
going to expect a cipher text using kab
one therefore even though Trudy can't
accept the cipher text but this
ciphertext is produced using kab - she
cannot simply send it back to Bob
because the server text sent to Bob must
be encrypted using kab one another way
to prevent the refreshin attack is to
use different challenges for the
initiator and responder for example we
can use even number challenge for Alice
an odd number for Bob therefore when
truly received a challenge are one from
Bob the challenge is an odd number and
Trudy cannot use this is a new challenge
for Bob because Bob is expecting an even
number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
