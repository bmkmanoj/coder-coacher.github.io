at logic blocks so I'm a chief
application architect and what this
means is that I oversee all of our app
development and pretty central in
designing coming up with the initial
design for any kind of new products that
we develop I'd often do a fair amount of
prototyping data modeling early early in
a new product that we're developing for
a new client sometimes often actually
interact with customers to make sure
we're clear and requirements when we
start and I'll often make a lot of the
initial programming decisions and then
and then start to farm it out to a group
of developers and and I'm guessing you
also have a strategic role as far as how
the company is going to be developing
applications on in the future that's
right so in addition to the apple chief
application architect i'm also an
executive vice president so as an
architect what what kinds of decisions
do you have to deal with in terms of
structuring this this this code base so
typically they're they're kind of two
scenarios where I were out where I get
involved so there are new configurations
of existing services that we've
implemented before and they're most of
my work is just in requirements analysis
to understand differences between
clients and helping to put together an
application development team to go to go
extend that configuration to the new
client that's kind of the normal the
normal development role and I do that
for several products in our in our
family that we've done many times before
we deployed these services many times
before for previous clients and it's
it's really just a matter of of kind of
bringing up a team of developers and
just tell them showing them what the
architecture is and telling them how to
how to flush it out for new products and
as of not too long ago the forecast
manager that we're going to talk about
later was a was a new product for that I
actually had to do a lot of the initial
really the initial development of it we
did things like initial scalability
analysis there's often some pretty
complex calculations that that need to
be performed under not real time but
under
you know time constraints that a user
would would need to deem acceptable so I
do a lot of initial scalability analysis
which involves doing some coding up some
solution approaches making sure that we
understand how to do the integration
with all the various data that come from
the customer and also just doing data
modeling because a lot of the a lot of
times we find when we do a new
application there's a significant data
modeling exercise that needs to get done
before we can really start making
burgers and how about the software
process itself the development
activities and particularly as
strategically as far as improving
productivity in the long range yeah I
also play a role in that as you might
imagine we we we use we're an agile shop
and so we we tend to like really short
iterations where we we have demos at the
end of those iterations we use
traditional JIRA and other kinds of
technologies for issue tracking but yeah
our process mainly is one of when we
have a new project do an initial
architectural assessment which may take
a month or two to do the kind of
prototyping and scalability analysis
that we need and then we perceive and we
start bringing developers on usually
with the small number of developers that
scales up over time rather than is with
a big group that starts the beginning
and we use a very iterative usually one
to two week cycle iterations so the
scrum process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
