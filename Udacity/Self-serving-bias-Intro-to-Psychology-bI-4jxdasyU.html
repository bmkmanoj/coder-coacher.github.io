self-serving bias and the self-serving
bias is when we have the tendency to
make situational attributions for our
failures and dispositional attributions
for our successes and the reason we
asked you to pay so close attention to
this attribution theory is because of
this self-serving bias now when I first
started teaching psychology and covered
this topic I was actually quite
surprised by how often I used
dispositional attributions to explain
other people's behavior and now that I'm
aware of it I try to first look at
perhaps situational attributions for
example if my friend doesn't call me
back I try to look at perhaps reasons
such as her phone is dead or maybe she's
on the phone with her boyfriend or she
had to work late
instead of using a dispositional
attribution and saying perhaps she's
lazy or selfish can you think of any
times in your life when you've used a
situational attribution instead of a
dispositional one or vice-versa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
