we needed was these two rules and we can
make infinitely many words this is the
power that recursive definitions give us
and unlike the previous definition which
was circular what we have now is what we
call a recursive definition that means
we have defined word in terms of itself
but that's not the only way we've
defined word we also have this other
rule that allows us to have a starting
point that there's one word that we have
that's defined not in terms of itself so
here's how we can make infinitely many
words using these rules so we can start
with a non-terminal word and let's say
we choose to use the first rule we can
replace word directly with our hippo
word and we're done but we have another
option we could replace word using the
second rule with counter word and if we
replace this word using the second rule
will end up with the word counter hippo
bogota phobia but that's not the only
choice right we could have chosen to use
the first rule again and then we will
place this word with counter hyphen word
and so now we have counter counter word
again we have the choice what to do with
this word we could use the second rule
replace it with the terminal and then
we'll have counter counter hippo or we
could replace it using the first rule
and then we'll have counter counter
counter followed by word so this can
keep going as long as we want we can
produce all of these words with any
number of counter either zero
repetitions of counter one two three
four as many as we want that means that
we can produce infinitely many words
some of them are going to be pretty hard
to pronounce actually they're all pretty
hard to pronounce but there's no limit
to the number of words we can produce
this way so this is what's called the
recursive definition and the important
thing that it has is two parts it has a
base case which is here that's the
stopping condition that's something that
says we have at least one word that we
can define already that we don't need to
define
in terms of word and it has the
recursive case that says we can define a
word in terms of another word and if we
combine those two well now we have a
definition that can make infinitely many
words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
