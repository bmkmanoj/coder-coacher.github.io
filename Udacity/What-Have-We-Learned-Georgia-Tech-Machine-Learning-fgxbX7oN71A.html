mean specifically in the context of this
game theory to lesson that's a that's a
good question we learned about iterated
prisoner's dilemma which turns out to be
cool and it solves the problem and we
learned about how we can connect
iterated prisoner's dilemma to
reinforcement learning what do you mean
through the discount yes I think of that
as being the idea of repeated games
right let's see what else have we
learned so we learned about iterated
prisoner's dilemma which allowed us to
get past this really scary thing with
repeated games connected it with
reinforcement learning with discounting
and then we learned other things like
for example I don't remember what what
did we learn well so the connection
between iterated prisoner's lemon
repeated games was the idea that we can
actually encourage cooperation and in
fact there's a whole bunch of new Nash
equilibria that appear when you work in
repeated games and that was the concept
of the folk theorem right the folk there
so the folk theorem was really cool and
this whole notion of repeated games
really seems like a clever way of
getting out of what appeared to be
limitations in game theory right yep in
particular by using things like threats
right but only plausible threads right
so that was the next thing we talked
about the idea that an equilibrium could
be sub game perfect or not and if it
wasn't then the threats could be
implausible but in the sub game perfect
setting they are more plausible right
let's see and then we learned about
minimax q well there was one last thing
we did on the repeated games which was
the computational folk theorem ah yes
you're right so basically what we
learned is that Michael Lippmann does
cool stuff in game theory or at least he
does stuff that he's willing to talk
about in a MOOC yes so that's that's a
there's actually a technical term for
that right Luke acceptable research oh I
didn't know that mm-hmm so all these
things are by virtue of the fact that
they showed up in this class Luke
acceptable exactly all right you're
right then we switch to stochastic games
mm-hmm and they generalize MDPs and
repeated games mm-hmm anything else well
that particularly got us to mini max Q
and then eventually didn't ask you but
despite the fact that Nash
you doesn't work we ended up in a place
of hope we end with some hopefulness
yeah and you know I think that that's
actually a lesson for the entire course
that at the end of the day sometimes it
doesn't always work but there's always
hope we don't give up and that's that's
that's what how research works even when
we have impossibility results for things
like clustering or multi-agent
multi-agent learning and decision making
we still keep struggling forward and
keep learning and isn't what's really
important I think so it's important for
us and it's important for machines yes
that is beautiful I feel like we've made
it to a good place Michael perhaps we
should stop well it has been it has been
delightful getting to talk to everyone
and has been very fun getting to talk
with you Charles and thanks to everybody
for making this happen I agree and we
have one more chance to talk with one
another as we wrap up the class and I
look forward to that so I will see you
then Michael also do we get to see each
other in person for that we get to see
each other in person for that that'll be
fun yay okay well bye Michael I'll see
you next time bye see ya bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
