to get the most tightly fitting
regression or classifier that you can
that's a classic high variance situation
you want to be careful that you're not
overfitting to the data when you're
doing this and so another way to frame
this whole discussion about the number
of features that you should be using can
be phrased in terms of the bias variance
dilemma or how many features should you
be using so that you're balancing these
two concerns you want to have the
accurate description that comes with
having enough variance to your model you
want it to be able to fit to your data
in a in an accurate and true way but you
want to do it with the minimum number of
features that's needed to do that so
there's this trade-off between sort of
the goodness of the fit and the
simplicity of the fit the number of
features that you have to use to achieve
that goodness of fit and so what that
means is you want to fit an algorithm
with few features but using the case of
a regression it has a large r-squared or
conversely a low sum of the squared
residual errors this is the sweet spot
that you want to find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
