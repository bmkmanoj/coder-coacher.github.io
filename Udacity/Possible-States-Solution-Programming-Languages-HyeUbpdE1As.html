one and we've seen all of it then we
totally could be in this state egos to
one and then there's my finger that's
where we are we've already seen the one
we're done with we're ready to apply
this rule he goes to one everything here
is fine here the input hasn't changed
and we have another state but remember
that we said before depending on your
point of view when you see a one you
could either be reducing a 12 the 12
expression or you could be completely
done with parsing one is in the language
of this grammar we normally think of
things like 1 plus 2 minus 3 but the
lowly one alone is in this grammar s
goes to EE goes to 1 and this says I
finished parsing the string great now we
just see a one but the state says oh
I've seen in E and I've seen a plus and
I'm looking for an e in the future this
can't work because it requires us to
have seen the plus if I put my finger
here the plus is in the past and I
haven't seen any pluses in the input so
we can't make that work out the next one
has the same input but a slightly
different state I've seen an e and i'm
looking for a plus and then another e
yeah I could totally imagine a plus
followed by another a filling this out
that could work so this is a possible
state that we could be in and we see one
plus as the input this is a little more
complicated and now the one that we had
to reject before suddenly becomes valid
my finger is here and II and the plus
are in the past here's the e here's the
plus and I'm looking for some new
expression in the future this fits very
well the last one was a bit of a ringer
this was a bit of a trick question it
required you to have the definition well
in hand this looks very promising I put
my finger here and it says oh there's a
one and A plus in the past and we're
looking for Annie that all sounds good
but remember that the definition of a
parsing state is that it's one of the
rules from our grammar augmented with a
single red dot e goes to 1 plus e is not
a role at our grammar the closest rule
in our grammar is 5 which is e goes to E
Plus II every sim
matters this can't be a valid parsing
state because he goes to 1 plus e is not
a rule in our grammar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
