use a camera position builder this
builder takes the properties that you've
just seen such as the target which is a
latitude and longitude the zoom that you
want how far you want to be zoomed in to
the map the bearing of the camera the
direction that it's pointing in and the
tilt of the camera when you've said all
these properties and you build it you
will then get a camera position and I've
just called it CP here then if you want
to instantaneously update the map to
show the location of the camera is
pointing out with these values you call
map move camera and you pass it a camera
update factory dot new camera position
with that camera position that you've
just defined like I said this will
instantaneously move the map to that
location but you may also want to
animate the map to that position where
you'll see a flyover type effect will
fly to the new location and to do this
you'll use animate camera an animate
camera takes the same camera update
factory dot new camera position with
your camera position but it also has a
couple of extra parameters one is the
time in milliseconds that you want it to
take to fly to the new location of
course you might want to zip over there
really quickly or you might want to
slope an upward over the earth and down
to the new location when you specify the
time in milliseconds here so if you
wanted to take five seconds you'd put
five thousand milliseconds in here and
the callback function gets called when
the animation is complete so if you want
to execute some code once the animation
is done you could put it in that
callback function if you don't want to
use a callback function you can just put
a null here let's take a look at an
animated camera in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
