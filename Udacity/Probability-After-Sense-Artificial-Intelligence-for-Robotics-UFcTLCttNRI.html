robot in its world with five different
grid cells X 1 2 X 5 let's assume 2 of
those cells are colored red whereas the
other 3 are green as before we assign
uniform probability to each cell of 0.2
and our robot is now allowed to sense
and what it sees is a red color
how will this affect my belief over
different places obviously the ones for
X 2 and X 3 each will go up and the ones
for X 1 X 4 and X 5 will go down so I'm
going to tell you how to incorporate
this measurement into our belief with a
very simple rule a product any cell
where the color is correct any of the
red cells will be multiplied with a
relatively large number say is 0.6 that
feels small but as well see later is
actually a large number whereas all the
green cells will be multiplied with 0.2
we look at the ratio of those then it
seems about 3 times as likely to be in a
red cell then it is to be in a green
cell because 0.6 is three times larger a
10 point to let us do the multiplication
for each of those five cells can you
tell me what the result would be
multiplying in the measurement in the
way I've stated oh please for these five
boxes fill out the number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
