concept map for lesson 3 starting here
at the human genome there's ninety-eight
percent of it approximately that's
non-coding doesn't code for anything and
about two percent of it is protein
coding but all these regions as part of
the genome are actually made of DNA CH
we learned a lot about in lesson two and
in Lesson four will learn more about
this non-coding region but here in less
than three we learned about the
protein-coding regions of the human
genome which are divided into jeans
jeans can have different sequences so
they can have different versions they
can code for different things and we
call these different versions alleles
this is a word will keep coming back to
in this course and alleles originated
from mutations which we'll learn about
more in less than six now a protein
coding gene is composed of two major
kinds of sequence introns and exons the
introns are spliced out of the message
that's going to be produced and exons
are going to be kept in the messenger
RNA or mrna now the process that
synthesizes mRNA from the gene DNA is
transcription and it's the first part of
the central dogma now once you have an
mRNA transcribed from the DNA gene it's
going to be translated by ribosomes into
protein protein to the building blocks
of cells in this central process of
genes to RNA or DNA to RNA to protein is
called the central dogma now RNA is
similar to DNA in that it's made up of
nucleotides though not deoxynucleotides
and there are four types of nitrogenous
bases here adenine which can base pair
with uracil or you a new nitrogenous
base in the RNA alphabet and we still
have guanine that compared with cytosine
now our mRNA transcript is actually
divided into codons which are groups of
three letters of nucleotides there are a
total of sixty four combinations of
codons that are possible based on this
grouping of
three and these 64 combinations are
interpreted as the genetic code and in
the genetic code we have three stop
codons one start codon and all the rest
code for 20 different types of amino
acids these amino acids make up proteins
and these proteins are the building
blocks of your cells that make up who
you are I hope this helps clear up some
of the major concepts you learned about
here in lesson 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
