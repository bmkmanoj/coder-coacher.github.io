expect a female to develop if we look
just at the sex chromosome pair here we
see that we have two x's and two x's
means that we don't have a Y or Y is
what triggers male development so in the
absence of the Y chromosome it means
that we're going to get female
development in humans all females are
genetically xx they have two x
chromosomes and all males are
genetically XY they have one X and one Y
chromosome now there's no YY combination
that exists in reality and it's for two
main reasons the first is that you only
have two parents a male and a female so
you have someone xx and someone XY so
there's only one Y to pass down to the
next generation anyways so getting a
second Y just really isn't even possible
normally speaking and the second reason
is that the Y chromosome is a lot
smaller than the X there's actually a
lot of important information that's on
the x chromosome here that's not on the
Y and without that information a human
without an X chromosome can't survive so
you always need at least one x
chromosome and although there are
actually variations on this theme here
the only two real combinations that
we'll talk about are the XX combination
which develop as females and the XY
combination which develop as males</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
