last time we'll set that the goal is to
get the batter out via pitching and
we'll add the necessary information to
our current working memory but when we
get down here something confusing
happens so we suggest the throw
curveball operator because our goal is
to pitch and the batter isn't out but
then we also suggest they throw a
fastball operator because the goal is to
pitch the batter is not out and the
batter bats left-handed so when we get
down to rule seven which is if only one
operator has been selected it doesn't
fire so our current rules don't actually
lead anywhere we never bottomed out we
never figure out what we want to do good
David that was a correct answer so note
what has happened so far we had assumed
that the match between the percepts and
the production rules capturing the
procedural knowledge was such that given
the percepts will always have one rule
which will tell us what action to take
it may take some time to get to this
rule some rules many may need to be
established and then only so the rules
get established then only we get the
action but nevertheless this system
would work the difficulty now is there
is no rule which tells us exactly what
action to take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
