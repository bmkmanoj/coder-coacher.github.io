way to visualize a mass bobbing on a
spring let me try that picture over here
okay so we're thinking about this mass
going up from x max to minus x max and
we've talked about this interpretation
over here but this was a graph of
position versus velocity what if I would
know position versus time well the time
equals zero our math started up here at
x max remember the period was two
seconds so after two seconds
well one cycle one period means that the
mass has returned to its original
starting point why don't after one
second halfway between these two well
after one second our object was way down
here all the way negative x max after
0.5 seconds the object passes through
equilibrium so we're going to draw its
position on this zero line and same with
after 1.5 seconds it turns out that if
you fill in more and more parts of this
graph more and more dots you'll see a
shape start to emerge and you can fill
in those dots using the math we learned
just in the previous video this is a
graph of position versus time which we
call X of T and this is a wonderful
equation it says that we have some
maximum let's call this amplitude that's
modified by this function sine of Omega
T plus PI over 2 and this is just some
function that whenever I plug in a T it
gives me a number between negative 1 1
and it repeats forever now I'm gonna
draw some potential graphs for the
velocity as a function of time and I
want you to tell me which one is the
best so I've drawn you some graphs no
it's not just a bunch of pretty pictures
though I agree they are very beautiful
so this may look confusing but the way
to read this graph is to look one color
at a time so we know that the blue graph
depicts a position versus time and what
we want now is velocity versus time and
there's four candidates well there's the
blue graph maybe you think it has the
exact same graph as position there's the
green and the pink and the red now I
want you to look through these and think
which makes sense and the best thing to
do will be to look at this diagram and
think okay if our motion is starting up
here and progressing around this phase
diagram which of these graphs best make
sense for the velocity as a function of
time and think does the particle start
with velocity or does it start with
positive negative zero velocity when is
the velocity negative one is it positive
everything you can learn from this you
should be able to see reflected in this
graph somehow so go ahead take a stab at
it this is a
the question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
