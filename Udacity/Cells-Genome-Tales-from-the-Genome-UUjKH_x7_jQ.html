hope you have a new appreciation for
what the human genome really is we've
zoomed all the way in and looked at
double-stranded DNA naked by itself but
inside a cell DNA is almost always
wrapped up around histone proteins and
organized into a higher order structure
called the chromosome and chromosomes
are pretty much what we've been dealing
with for the last couple of exercises
okay let me make sure you have this
right okay so my genome that's inside of
one of my cells is made up of two copies
of 3 billion base pairs of letters that
are organized into 23 pairs of
chromosomes that's exactly right
almost I thought I had it you did but
I've left out one tiny detail actually
there's more DNA than just the 23 pairs
of chromosomes in the nucleus there's a
little bit of DNA actually outside in
the cytoplasm of the cell
inside another organelle and scientists
have figured out that this organelle
that has its own DNA used to be its own
free living bacteria okay but what's an
organelle again well an organelle is
just kind of like an organ for cell um
there membrane-bound structures that
perform particular functions inside a
cell so take a look at this picture of a
cell here what I want to see if you can
do is look at this picture and pick out
which organelle you think has its own
set of DNA now this could be a little
difficult if you don't have a background
or know where to look but remember that
this organelle used to be its own free
living bacteria and bacteria
look like this so do your best and see
if you can figure out which organelle
has its own DNA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
