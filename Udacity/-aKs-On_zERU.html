quintessential problems of linear
algebra given a set of flat geometric
objects such as lines and planes what
are their common intersection points in
the abstract it isn't immediately
obvious why this problem has much
interest outside of pure mathematics
how do the intersections of lines and
planes come up in real life
geometric objects are often defined to
be sets of points whose coordinates
satisfy a particular relationship like
an equation for example this ellipse in
the plane is the set of all points X
comma Y that satisfy the equation
one-fourth times x squared plus 1 9th
times y squared equals 1 and the shape
in three dimensions called a hyperboloid
is the set of all points X comma Y comma
Z satisfying the equation x squared plus
y squared minus Z squared equals 1 flat
objects like lines and planes satisfy a
special type of equation called a linear
equation in which the only operations
allowed are adding and subtracting
variables and constants and multiplying
variables by constants so for example x
plus 2y equals 1 and y over 2 minus 2z
equals x are linear equations but x
squared minus one equals y is not linear
because x is being multiplied by x and y
over x equals 3 is also not linear
because a variable Y is being divided by
another variable X in real world
situations these equations typically
come from observed or modeled
relationships between quantities
let's take a look at a modified example
from machine learning for trading
suppose I'm trading stocks and I have a
choice of two stocks a and B that I can
put into my portfolio
let's denote the proportion of each in
my portfolio by wa and WB which are
weights between zero meaning none of
that stock is in the portfolio and one
meaning that the portfolio is entirely
that stock note that WA and WB
have to add up to one since any portion
of the portfolio that isn't a must be be
this gives me the linear relationship wa
plus W B equals one each stock also has
an associated metric called its beta
value representing how correlated its
price movements are with those of the
overall stock market the beta value of
my portfolio is a weighted average of
the beta values of its individual
components so if the beta value of a is
minus 1 and the beta value of b is two
then the beta value of my portfolio is
wa x minus one plus WB x 2 or simplified
2 WB minus wa having a beta value of
zero means that the portfolio is
uncorrelated with the market so it has
minimal market risk suppose I want to
choose my weights so that I minimize
market risk and that means i need the
weights to satisfy the equation 2 WB
minus wa equals 0
this gives me a second linear
relationship between the weights of the
stocks in my portfolio in other words i
now have two lines finding what values
of WA and WC satisfy both equations in
other words finding at what point the
two lines intersect at tells me what the
weights of the stocks i choose should be
in order to minimize my portfolios
market risk often variables are factors
that are within our control but which we
want to set to correct values in order
to satisfy some constraints in the
previous example our variables were the
weights of the stocks in the portfolio
and we had two constraints that we
wanted the weights to satisfy in order
to achieve some goal interpreting this
problem in geometric language we created
two lines and we want to define the
point where they intersected what we
created is called a system of linear
equations finding points that satisfy
all the equations at the same time is
called solving the system in practice
this is how problems involving the
intersections of geometric object
scum about these types of problems show
up in fields as diverse as economics
biology chemistry physics engineering
and of course computer science in this
lesson we will use our tools from the
first lesson on vector operations to
solve this ubiquitous problem of finding
intersections</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
