Jennifer's Alex and I am
the director of training and research
for a special program here at Cal State
Universities which functions like a
teaching aquarium for students from all
over the world to come and learn about
how to use animal behavior modification
to take the best possible care of
animals and work with them in zoo and
aquarium environments as well as in
research facilities so in your writing a
book because you're an expert in the
field but what's that book it's called
animal training 101 the complete and
practical guide to the art and science
of behavior modification and I hope
it'll be a good guide for people who are
interested in animal training and
behavior in general so do you use the
ABCs of operant conditioning in your
work yes so the ABCs of operant
conditioning is one of the classic ways
that people explain the idea of how
behavior is developed and a stands for
antecedent B behavior and C consequence
this is the method by which behavior is
created whether I'm doing it
intentionally or whether it's happening
on its own in the natural world the
antecedent to trained behavior is a cue
the antecedent in the process of
training is usually a type of
conditioning technique that you use for
example you'll see us using targets this
is a thing that we can use to cause and
create the behavior that we then want to
see which is the B and then the C the
consequence is the reward the
reinforcement that influences the animal
to want to do that behavior again in the
future
another type of consequence can be a
Punisher so there's two types of
constant well there's actually three
types of consequences reinforcer which
increases the frequency of the behavior
neutral which does nothing to the
frequency of behavior and Punisher which
decreases the frequency of behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
