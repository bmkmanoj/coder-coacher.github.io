help create your product if there's a
difference between how your app works
right now and how you hope it will work
in the future then you probably need an
engineer for your startup let's focus on
front-end back-end mobile and data
engineers so what's a front-end engineer
a front-end engineer helps design the
look of your app create interactions and
build the overall user experience
they'll make responsive interfaces so
that your app is accessible no matter
what device your user has take a little
time to explore some of your favorite
web apps is there anything you like
about them maybe there's something you
find a bit awkward either way that's
something a front-end engineer developed
how about a backend engineer back-end
engineers build and maintain the
technology that powers your servers and
databases they're responsible for
storing and distributing this data to
the rest of your team as your business
scales back-end engineers will help
create the infrastructure necessary to
continue running smoothly now let's look
at mobile engineers mobile based apps
are native apps you download and run on
your Android or iOS phones a mobile
engineer is responsible for building
this mobile base functionality they're
able to improve mobile performance and
test apps on new devices common types of
mobile engineers are Android and iOS
developers mobile engineers can give
direct access to Bluetooth gyroscope and
accelerometer functionality within your
app and finally what's a data engineer
data engineers focus on developing the
architecture your business needs to
collect manage and analyze data they
have some similar responsibilities to
back-end engineers to help distribute
data to your team by creating the data
pipelines necessary to collect and
organize your data this will help you
make data-driven decisions for your
business so you can more accurately meet
the needs of your users there's so much
more you can learn about these different
types of Engineers but now that you know
a little do you see yourself needing any
of these skills for your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
