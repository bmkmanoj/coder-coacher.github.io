first one is actually not true
the reason it's not true is there's no
guarantee that the same ciphertext with
different keys doesn't decrypt it the
same message so we know that the size of
m0 is no bigger than the size of K
because we constructed by unioning the
decryption which produces just one
result over all possible keys
we know that it's no bigger than the
number of possible keys we don't know
that it's actually equal to that that
would require another assumption about
the decryption function the other two
properties we do know are correct so we
know that m0 has fewer elements than m
and this is the case because of this
assumption that we said that the space
of possible messages is greater than the
space of possible keys so if that's the
case combined with the size of m0 being
less than or equal to K well then we
know that the size of m0 must be less
than the size of M the third property is
also true and this is the key property
that should give us the insight why it
can't be a perfect cipher is that there
exists some message in M that can't be
an m0 and that follows directly from
this property if one set is bigger than
another set there must be some element
in the bigger set that's not in the
smaller one so how do we go from there
to prove that it's not a perfect cipher
well let's remember our definition of a
perfect cipher and that was that the
probability that the message is some
particular message given the ciphertext
without knowing anything other than that
ciphertext is equal to the probability
that M star was the message beforehand
that probably hasn't changed in this
case well if we have intercepted c0 this
was our ciphertext for the example well
because of this property we know that
the probability that the message is M
star is actually 0 because that's not in
the set of possible decryptions of c0
over all possible keys but we said that
M star was a message in M that initially
had some nonzero probability which is
not the case that these two are equal
because this was greater than 0 so we've
contradicted the requirement for a
perfect cipher
the only assumption that went into this
was this one we assumed that there
existed a perfect cipher where the
number of messages is greater than the
number of keys and we've reached a
contradiction so this proves that there
exists no perfect ciphers where the
number of messages is greater than the
number of keys so this is bad news every
cipher that's practical must be
imperfect so this means that given some
ciphertext that an attacker intercepts
even if the attacker knows nothing about
the key they can eliminate some of the
possible messages so this means when
people attempt to use ciphers similar to
a one-time pad in practice they tend to
actually not work very well and the
reason for this is that they reuse keys
because the number of messages they want
to encrypt is greater than the number of
keys they have next we'll look at an
interesting historical example of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
