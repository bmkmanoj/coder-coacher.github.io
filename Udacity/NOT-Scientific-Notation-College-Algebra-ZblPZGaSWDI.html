specific form so people all over the
world can compare numbers that are
really large or really small that form
is a times ten to the B now this X here
denotes multiplication it is not a
variable this form requires that the
first number here is a number between
one which is included in ten not
included and then this is multiplied by
an integer power of 10 so an example of
something like this would be five point
six times ten to the to notice that 5.6
is in fact a number between one and ten
this is something we need to be very
careful about and it's easy to make a
mistake for example we can make one very
small change if instead we had 56 times
10 to the 2 we're no longer writing in
scientific notation 56 is not between
one and ten now i'm going to write down
several numbers and i'd like you to tell
me which of them are not written in the
proper form for scientific notation we
have 5 times 10 to the 12th six point
five four three times ten to the
negative 4 6 times 10 to the 6.5 1.2
times 100 to the fourth 0.5 times 10 to
the third four times two to the sixth
and last but not least 325 times 10 to
the negative 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
