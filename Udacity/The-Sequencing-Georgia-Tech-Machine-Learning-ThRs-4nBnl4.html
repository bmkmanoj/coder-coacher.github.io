today I'm doing just fine how are you
doing all right I'm a little bit out of
practice with dyslexia thing so I hope
this goes well I'm absolutely sure it
will so today's lesson is continuing
what you were talking about in terms of
game theory but I'm going to be focusing
in on what happens when you are worried
about making decisions with more than
one player in a sequence which we
started to get into at the end of your
discussion but I'm gonna go more into it
okay I really like the logo by the way
thanks very much yeah it's a it's a
specially designed game theory logo I
like it very much I look at very much I
will point out however that all sequels
should be called the quickening yeah i
was gonna go with the quickening or
judgement day but i didn't didn't think
that made any sense mmm that's a fair
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
