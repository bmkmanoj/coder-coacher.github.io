want to loop over the rows and columns
let's first loop over the rows so we'll
have a row index I that assumes two
values 0 1 and 2 in this example
similarly we'll have a column index J
that in this example will go from 0 to 1
if you had more columns of course we
would go further when you have a row and
column index then we can access the
element add to the I throw and the jth
column so what you see over here is the
general expression for an element at an
arbitrary row and arbitrary column in
this case we just printed and we use
printf so that the printout lines up
nicely so we would now print this
element and then print that element and
that would finish the inner loop then
the outer loop would pick the next row
we print these two and then the outer
loop picks the last row and we print
those two now of course we want the
numbers to line up nicely so after
printing each row we want to print a new
line notice that this statement is
contained in the outer loop because it
happens once per row but it's not in the
inner loop because we don't want a new
line after every of the elements now
let's look at the missing bounds here of
course in this simple example I could
just say I should be less than 3 J
should be less than 2 but in general
someone might just hand you a
two-dimensional array and you should ask
it how big it is just like with a
one-dimensional array you just use the
length field to find out how big an
array is you can get the number of rows
from a two-dimensional array by asking
it array named lengths and the reason
for this is that a two-dimensional array
is actually an array of one-dimensional
arrays so prices which looks like this
nice tabular arrangement really is an
array of three arrays one for each row
and so the number of rows is given by
that length now we need to look at how
many columns we have here you have a row
and the length of that row is the number
of columns so in general you should
simply remember that for any
two-dimensional array you get the number
of rows with this expression the number
of columns
with that expression now let's move on
to doing something more interesting with
two-dimensional arrays than gas prices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
