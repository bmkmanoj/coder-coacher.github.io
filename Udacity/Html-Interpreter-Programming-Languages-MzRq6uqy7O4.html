a parse tree for HTML remember that our
parse trees always grow upside down and
we have our actual tokens at the leaves
at the bottom this is a web page that
just says hello friends with no tags and
it has a large number of intermediate
nodes corresponding to non terminals or
rewrite rules in our grammar we want to
walk over this parse tree and decide
based on all these intermediate nodes to
print out to display on the screen as
our web page hello friends that process
is known as interpreting walking over
the tree to figure out what to do and in
some sense it's just like interpreting a
sentence in English to figure out what
it means or even translating a sentence
from one language to another recall that
our two major elements in our syntax
tree are represented in Python as tuples
word elements just have two parts the
word word hyphen element so that we know
what's going on and then the actual text
from the user and tag elements which
start with tag element again to make it
easier for us to interpret we'll see
that in just a minute the beginning tag
the ending tag and then down here a list
of other elements we also have a
JavaScript element which I haven't spent
as much time talking about but is our
way of representing embedded JavaScript
pieces of code in a web page we're going
to focus on these two for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
