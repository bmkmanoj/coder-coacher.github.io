looked at so far the end points of each
of the segments have matched up with one
another exactly which makes the graphs
continuous there are no breaks now when
this is the case we can choose to
include these boundary values these
values of x rays switch from one part of
the function to the other to be an ID of
the two parts of the function that come
together at that point we don't want any
overlaps however so in the case of this
last function we were looking at we
initially included the x equals zero
point in the parabola part of the
function which is why we had zero is
less than or equal to X is less than
three as the domain for this middle
piece of the function we could however
instead include 0 in this first linear
part the negative one-half X minus 4
part of the function if we decided to do
that we'd have to switch up our
inequalities over here so instead of
having 0 is less than or equal to X
right here we have 0 is less than X and
would switch the equal to part to be
over here so the domain for this first
line now is negative 5 is less than or
equal to X is less than or equal to 0 we
could do the same thing with x equals 3
right now we can see it's contained in
the f of x equals x minus 4 apportion
this line right here we could instead
include it in the parabola if we just
made x is less than or equal to 3
instead of X is less than three and if
we just switch this to a less than sign
sometimes however our piecewise
functions aren't continuous they often
have breaks in them but sometimes
piecewise functions aren't continuous
they often have breaks in them as you
can see in the two functions I've drawn
here if you want to show that a certain
point is not defined on a function or in
other words if we want to exclude its
x-coordinate from the domain we just
draw a little open circle at that point
like I've done in several places here
now for each of these two piecewise
functions here I'd like you to decide
which of these endpoints should stay
open and which ones should be filled in
based of course on how I've defined the
domains for either the functions if you
think an endpoint should be filled in
just click the circle that's at that
endpoint and if you want it to stay open
then just leave it open don't mark it to
double check your work you can make sure
that there's no x value on either of
these graphs that belongs to to differ
parts of the functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
