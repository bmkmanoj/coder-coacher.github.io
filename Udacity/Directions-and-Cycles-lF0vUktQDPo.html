that make them useful for modeling
various types of data edges can have a
direction meaning the relationship
between two nodes only applies in one
way and not the other directed graph is
the term for a graph where the edges
have a sense of direction for example if
you're using a graph to represent travel
plans a directed edge can be used to
show which city you start in in which
you travel too often one node will be
the start and the other the end of the
relationship or action taking place you
might describe the edge of a graph as
the first node a verb the word to and
the other node here it's from SF travel
to Tokyo if you make a round trip and
travel through the same two cities going
in opposite directions you might have
two edges between the same two nodes one
representing each direction you travel
in an undirected graph has edges with no
sense of direction for example if you
have a graph of people and edges are
drawn between two people who've met
before directed edges might be
unnecessary I previously mentioned that
graphs can have cycles but trees can't a
cycle happens in a graph when you can
start at one node and follow edges all
the way back to that node cycles and
graphs can be really dangerous when
you're describing algorithms you might
write some code to travel through the
nodes in your graph but if you have a
cycle you might just go through the same
sequence again and again and again in an
infinite loop you often need to make
sure the graph you're taking in as input
is a cyclic meaning it has no cycles one
type that shows up often is a dag or
directed acyclic graph it's really just
what it sounds like a directed graph
with no cycles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
