our editor let's open up the code in the
editor we can just pull this over from
finder and have this nice little sidebar
that is cool I annoyed it you could do
that okay so these are all our files
this is looking familiar now I played
around with these before so this these
are all JavaScript files I don't want to
look at them right now right the one
that seemed most important was that
index file mm-hmm yeah so this is the
HTML that we saw in the browser earlier
yeah and so right this is the HTML this
is that grid container with the rows and
the cells mm-hmm I had some different
tiles I made a Udacity flavored version
of this app okay I want to get them in
there so basically I want these
different the two tile the four tile to
be something different
okay so just replace the pictures yeah
should we do that in here is that can
happen in the CSS well let's see do we
see anything in here about the pictures
themselves I don't know all right so
let's try looking see you upstairs
dile yes we've got a couple of different
CSS so the one we were playing with
before was the main so maybe that's yeah
that's probably probably the best place
to look okay so I'm gonna search around
for tiles and make some changes all
right cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
