places where it's let's say legally
reasonable to actually execute this
option or this abstract action similarly
we have termination sets and a
termination set is not the set of states
where an option may be ended it's
actually generalization of that it's a
set of probability so it maps States to
a number which is the probability that
the option will end in that state or can
into that state I think that makes it so
they're both they're both kind of sets
but this is kind of a more soft general
kind of set and is it saying that no
matter what when the option gets to one
of those terminations States you know
coin is flipped and if it comes up heads
then the options done I think from the
sort of from the point of view of the
person sitting outside the option yes
inside the option it doesn't have to be
quite done that it's not quite done that
way it's not like the option is running
and it's always flipping a coin this is
more sort of a way of describing the
fact that something can end in a
particular state now of course you could
turn this into a set by putting a
probability of 0 over all the states
where you don't want it to end and
having a probability of 1 exactly where
you want it to end I see so that's a
sense in which it's a generalization of
that idea right exactly but basically
I'm going to execute this action
starting from one of the states in set I
and it's going to run and it will end up
in some state when it when the option
terminates and this gives me a
probability of it being in one
particular State or the other so almond
action is right is it's well you're in a
state you take an action you end up in
another state but since we're talking
about these temporarily abstract options
things that happen over time we need to
know what's happening inside the option
while it's running and we already have a
term for that it's called a policy so
here we have a generalization of the way
we've been talking about policies anyway
policy is more than it within an option
a policy is more than just a mapping
from States to action here it's a
probability of being in a state and
taking a particular action but again we
could turn that into nor
policy as we've mostly been talking
about it by just having a probability of
1 over the action that we're going to
take and 0 over the one over everything
else and then it is just a direct simple
mapping from state action like a
deterministic Markov memoryless policy
being a majig yes exactly right but
anyway this is this is a formalism but I
think it sort of is just trying to
capture this idea of you know as you say
kind of a procedure or a function that
runs there are places where you can
execute the function there are states
where you will end up after you've
executed the function and there are
things that are happening inside the
function the code itself is the policy
it's a set of it's the actions that
you're going to take in the states that
you're going to see ok ok so let's see
what we can do with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
