thinking and I've written out the
complete grammar I think I've got it
right and now all I'm missing is
something that understands this format
so let's continue the wishful thinking
and and wish that we had a function that
could take this format and turn it into
something that we can then use in a
parser so here I'm applied the wishful
thinking say i wish i had this function
grammar that would give me this grammar
G and then I could use it to parse
expressions and now it's up to me to
deliver on that promise or that wishful
thinking so the first thing I should ask
myself is what do I want this object G
to look like one good idea would that G
could be a dictionary the keys of the
dictionary would be these things on the
left hand side and then the values of
each key would be some object
corresponding to this representation on
the right hand side I would have
expression something like this and now
all i gotta do is figure out what goes
on the right hand side here i've made a
choice and what I've said is well the
right hand side looks like it's always
going to be a set of alternatives the
order matters so I'm not going to make
it into a set I'm going to make it into
a sequence of some kind and let's make
that a tuple so the right hand side is
always going to be a tuple of
alternatives it might be a tuple of
length one but it's always going to be a
tuple each element of that tuple is
going to be a sequence here or sequence
of three items here a sequence of one
item will represent sequences at list so
here the three items and here's the one
item so every right hand side is a tuple
of list where the lists are a sequence
and each element of the list is an atom
and the atoms can either be the name of
a category that's defined on the left
hand side or they can be a regular
expression that's going to match an
actual characters in the input when we
go to parts now of course i could have
typed in the whole grammar like this to
begin with but that would have been
messy and error-prone and harder to read
so I did myself a favor imagining the
language i wanted and writing in that
language then figuring out how to get it
into something the computer can
understand and now all i have to do is
write this function grammar that
translates from this format into this
format unfortunately it's really easy to
write this function and here the whole
thing
here's what I've done I've initialized
the grammar that I'm going to produce to
be the empty dictionary and then I've
gone through the whole description
description is the input and split it up
by lines for each line I split up each
line by the arrow into left hand side
and a right hand side and then for each
right hand side I split that up using
the war sign into a list of alternatives
of one or more and then I've just said
let's assign to the left hand side
expression or term a tuple because
that's what we're using for alternatives
of the map of splitting up each
alternative so the alternative here
would be a string you'll be the string
everything starting from term ending
with expression and then I just mapped
the split function to it to split it up
into individual atoms that would split
it up into a three element list term
plus or minus an expression that's all I
need this is a description of the
grammar format immediately implements it
and builds up a dictionary for us and I
should say I've used here this utility
function split it's just like string dot
split except when it splits things up it
strips the white space from each of the
pieces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
