objective-c project we can see that the
gift class inherits from nsobject and
conforms to the NS coding protocol we're
going to need to add both of those to
our Swift gift class remember that in
order to be visible to Objective C ap is
a Swift class must inherit from nsobject
and that's true of the NS coding
protocol if we open up the gift dot m
file we can see that the two required
methods for the NS coding protocol are
implemented here the methods in it with
coder and encode with coder naturally
we'll need to implement these methods in
the Swift version as well you're going
to rewrite the message in it with coder
just like you see here
calling decode object for key for each
property to unarchive a gift and you're
going to rewrite the method in code with
coder just like you see here calling in
code object for key which takes the
object to be archived and the key as
parameters so to start off with here we
are back in our gift Swift file and
we're going to add NS object and NS
coding and of course the NS coding
protocol requires two methods in it with
coder and encode with coder
so on archiving is going to look
something like this and archiving is
going to look something like this and
I'll let you guys take it from here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
