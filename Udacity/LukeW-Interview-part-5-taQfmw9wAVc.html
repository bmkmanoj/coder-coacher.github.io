myself the methodology I like to think
of here is this sort of outside in view
that is you look at what your product
looks like the people outside of your
organization most companies think about
it from an inside-out perspective that
is oh we have these legal requirements
so the tech team can only build this the
design teams and you add up all of these
different ideas and thought processes
which make a lot of sense within the
bounds of your company but don't make a
lot of sense when somebody's looking at
it externally this is why you find
simple forms like a contact us form
including 20 fields because this one
came from legal that one comes from
marketing you have five things like this
because the database is structured this
way and one very common technique not
common but very useful technique that
you can have to force yourself to think
outside in is to actually have somebody
role play the role of a form and what do
I mean by if you give someone a form and
you act like a human and they only are
able to respond with what the form says
so for as an example you would say hi
I'm Luke I'm trying to decide whether or
not I want to get a loan with you first
name okay Luke last name wroblewski
gender male right and you can really
start to see how it doesn't make any
sense as a conversation if instead you
are to make that a real world
conversation you'd say something like hi
I'm looking to maybe get a loan oh well
what are you trying to buy oh well I'm
trying to buy a home is this your first
home and very natural you can weave that
process through and to go back to the
original answer this you know name value
pair in the database it is not a human
interaction that is a process of telling
a machine the required fields it needs
to process a document which generally is
not how we think about the world so that
role playing can go a really long way to
helping people see almost the silliness
if you will for a lot of the
interactions we have online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
