world was divided into discrete grids
and we assigned to each quit seller
probability such a representation of
probability of us places is called a
histogram in that it divides the
continuous space into discrete into
finally many grid cells an approximate
super Co distribution by a histogram
over the original distribution and the
histogram is a mere approximation to
this continuous distribution in common
Phaedrus the distribution is given by
what's called a Gaussian Gaussian is a
continuous function over the space of
locations in the area underneath sums up
to one so here's our Gaussian again and
if we call the space X then the Gaussian
is characterized by two parameters the
mean often abbreviated with a Greek
letter mu and the width of the Gaussian
often called the variance and for
reasons that I want to go into it's
often witness a quadratic variable Sigma
square so any Gaussian in 1d which means
the parameter space over here is one
dimensional is characterized by mu and
Sigma square so rather than estimating
entire distribution as a histogram our
task and common filters is to maintain a
mu and a Sigma square
there's our best estimate of the
location of the object we're trying to
find the exact formula is an exponential
of a quadratic function where we take
the exponent of this complicated
expression over here the quadratic
difference of our query point X relative
to the mean mu divided by Sigma square
multiplied by minus 1/2 now if x equals
mu then the enumerator becomes zero and
we have X of 0 which is 1
it turns out we have to normalize this
by a constant 1 over the square root of
2 Pi Sigma square but for everything we
talked about
this constant won't matter so ignore it
what matters is we have exponential of a
quadratic function over here so let me
draw you a couple of functions and you
tell me which one you believe are
Gaussian by checking the box on the
right side and please excuse my poor
drawing skills here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
