of Sebastian's self-driving cars
Sebastian's going to give us an idea of
how rich inputs and outputs can be by
talking about the kinds of inputs and
outputs that he has on the self-driving
car so taking data in is essential to
making self-driving cars sport this
machine has a lot of sensors that take
data in an enormous rates there is a
laser arranged by dog on the roof that
it rotates and it takes scans 10 times a
second of the entire surrounding is
arranged scans it has a spherical camera
very much like Google Street who is able
to see all directions
in fact this camera played an important
role in Google Street is history and
then it has a stereo camera system and
also has a GPS system that they used to
localize the car coarsely based on
satellite navigation so all this data
which are millions and means of data
points per second get fed into the
computer system that sits in the board's
trunk so this is the data this is the
laser data but a million points per
second and you can see in this
three-dimensional depiction removal is
parked in the garage
it sees the back wall and you can see
all kinds of other things around it it
uses that exact same data to avoid
collisions with other cars and
bicyclists and pedestrians and so on and
finally the data gets funneled back to
the car these are the outputs of the
computer system and they go into the car
two little switches over here they
actuate the steering wheel they use the
brake the gas you can't really see it it
looks like a regular car and it is but
if I hit this one button over here it
turns into a soft driving her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
