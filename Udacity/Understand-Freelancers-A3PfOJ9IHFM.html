help you build your startup freelancers
are workers who charge an hourly or
project-based rate for their skills
without being considered an employee of
your company there's people with all
types of skills that offer their
services as freelancers and there's a
few basic ideas you should understand
before working with one first let's look
at some of the benefits of working with
a freelancer freelancers can be great
for your business if you don't want to
commit to a full time employee or have a
limited and temporary need for example
maybe you need to use specialized
experience with the technology you don't
know or need to complete a series of
small tasks that would take too long to
do yourself if you have any of these
requirements for your business this
could be an excellent opportunity to
work with a freelancer while there are
benefits to working with a freelancer
it's important to understand some of the
downsides first working with real
answers can be very tricky it's
difficult to evaluate the skills of a
freelancer and because of this it's also
risky if you don't have recommendations
from people you personally know then you
need to evaluate the skills of each
freelancer from their portfolio also
communication can be a problem you'll
need to be aware of language barriers
and time zone differences and be patient
with some of the issues this can cause
while it can be difficult to find a
freelancer there are some great
platforms available for you to make your
decisions to start try using websites
such as freelancer fever and up work but
there are many other possibilities the
benefits of using these sites is that
they usually have some type of quality
assurance in place for their workers
there is also often more than one person
on a team to help minimize the risk that
your project won't be completed and most
of your communication will be done
through writing so be careful that
you're clear and concise about what you
need from any freelancer you're working
with freelancers provide an amazing
opportunity to get the skills you need
for your business once you get used to
the process it can really help
accelerate your growth as a company take
some time to decide if you think it's
possible to use freelancers to get any
of the skills you need for your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
