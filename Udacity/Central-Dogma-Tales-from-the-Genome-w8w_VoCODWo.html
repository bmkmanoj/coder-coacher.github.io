sequence will be transcribed into an RNA
copy or intermediate that will leave the
nucleus and go to the cytoplasm or will
be translated by ribosomes and to
protein now we're about to dive deep
into these processes called
transcription and translation but first
we should learn a bit more about this
RNA copy that's so critical to the
transfer of genetic information so if we
follow the central dogma and our example
of blood type our ABO gene made of DNA
is going to be turned into an ABO RNA
copy that can be trafficked to the
cytoplasm and here it will be turned
into the ABO protein by ribosomes now
these two arrows here that connect DNA
to RNA and RNA to protein are what we're
about to dive deep into these processes
are called transcription and translation
and by the end of this lesson you'll see
exactly how a DNA code is turned into
protein but for us to dive deep into
these processes we really need to
understand a bit more about this
critical intermediate copy RNA you'll
remember from lesson 2 that DNA is made
of deoxynucleotides and that's what I'm
showing you here this is the chemistry
the chemical structure we looked at when
we studied deoxynucleotides
and in this case there's an adenine or
an A as the nitrogenous base that's
attached now RNA is chemically speaking
incredibly similar to DNA in fact you
shouldn't only be able to notice one
difference about the chemical structure
of RNA compared to DNA RNA is made of
nucleotides instead of deoxynucleotides
and what I want you to try to do select
the region that distinguishes DNA from
RNA focus down here on the RNA
nucleotide and there are four regions to
choose from I want you to pick the one
that you think distinguishes it from the
DNA deoxynucleotide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
