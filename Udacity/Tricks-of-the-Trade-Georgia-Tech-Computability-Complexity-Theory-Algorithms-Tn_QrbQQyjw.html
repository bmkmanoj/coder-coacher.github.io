our flow networks in several ways to
make our treatment of them a little
simpler before going any further I want
to show some tricks of the trade that
allow all of the theorems and algorithms
that we'll study to be applied to more
general networks one such limitation is
the need for all the capacities on the
edges to be integers we can extend all
our arguments to rational capacities
just by multiplying the capacities by
the least common multiple of the
denominators to create integer
capacities so in this case I would
simply multiply all the capacities by 6
this just amounts to a change of units
in our measurement of the flow another
limitation we've imposed is that no anti
parallel edges are allowed in the
network this forces us to choose a
direction for the flow between every
pair of vertices in general however it
may not be clear in which direction the
flow should go before solving the
max-flow problem it's possible to cope
with this situation with some slightly
less elegant analysis or just to
convince yourself that the theorem still
hold add an artificial vertex between
the two nodes and create two edges to
simulate a reverse flow in this
direction another limitation of our
model is that we've limited ourselves to
having a single source and a single sink
at first it would seem like we couldn't
handle a network like this one where we
have two sources and three sinks
actually however this situation is quite
easy to deal with we can just add an
artificial source node and connect that
to the others with an infinite capacity
and similarly add an artificial sink so
don't let that limitation trouble you
either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
