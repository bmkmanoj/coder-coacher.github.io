software-defined networking which is
network virtualization so we'll talk
first about what network virtualization
is then we'll talk about how it's
implemented and then we'll talk about
some examples and applications such as
mini net so network virtualization is
simply an abstraction of the physical
network where multiple logical networks
can be run on the same underlying shared
physical substrate for example a logical
network might map a particular network
topology on to the underlying physical
topology and there might be multiple
logical networks that map onto the same
physical topology and these logical
networks might actually share nodes and
links in the underlying physical
topology but each logical Network has
its own view as if it were running its
own private version of the network now
you can see from this picture that the
nodes in the physical network need to be
shared or sliced so the nodes in the
physical topology might be virtual
machines similarly a single link in the
logical topology might map to multiple
links in the physical topology the
mechanism to achieve these virtual links
is typically through tunneling so a
packet that's destined from A to B in
the logical topology might be
encapsulated in a packet that's destined
for node X first before the packet is D
capsulated and ultimately sent to be may
also be easy to understand virtual
networking as an analogy to virtual
machines which you may be familiar with
already so in a virtual machine
environment we have virtual machines
where a hypervisor arbitrates access to
the underlying physical resources
providing to each virtual machine the
illusion that it's operating on its own
dedicated version of the hardware
similarly with virtual networking a
network hypervisor of sorts arbitrates
access to the underlying physical
network to multiple virtual networks
providing the illusion that each virtual
network actually has its own dedicated
physical network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
