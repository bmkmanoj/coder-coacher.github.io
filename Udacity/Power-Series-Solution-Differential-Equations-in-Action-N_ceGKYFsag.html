down for equal factors 1 plus x over 4
times 1 plus x over 4 times 1 plus x
over 4 times 1 plus x over 4 and then we
look what this is going to turn into for
the first box we need everything that
has no X whatsoever this is just 1 x 1 x
1 x 1 anything else would have an X in
it so this becomes 1 for the next box we
need everything that has precisely 1 X
in it for instance x over 4 times 1
times 1 times 1 1 times x over 4 times 1
times 1 1 times 1 times x over 4 times 1
and there's a fourth one 1 times 1 times
1 times x over 4 we get four of these
four times x over 4 which is 1 times x
for x squared we have X from the first
two parentheses but one from parentheses
number three and parentheses number for
X from the first one from the second X
from the third one from the fourth or X
from the first one from the second one
from the third and X from the fourth or
one from the first X from the second X
from the third one from the fourth one
from the first X from the second one
from the third and X from the fourth and
the final 11 from the first one from the
second X from the third X from the
fourth six options to form something
that contains x squared six times x over
4 times x over 4 we can cancel a factor
of 2 which leaves us with 3 / 8 to get X
to the third power we need to pick X
from three parentheses and one from the
other we can pick X from the
first three parentheses and the one from
the last or X from parentheses number
one number two the one from the third X
from the last x from the first
parentheses one from the second X from
the third X from the fourth and one from
the first X from the second X from the
third X from the fourth so four ways of
doing this four times x over 4 times x
over 4 times x over 4 which leaves us
with x to the third power or was 16 10
16 and the final one we need for factors
of x we have to pick this and this and
this and this that's it only one option
for doing that which leaves us with x
over 4 times x over 4 times x over 4
times x over 4 x to the fourth power /
256 one over 256 so this is a crude
approximation to the exponential
function and we find a way of expressing
this with powers of X the beginning of a
power series let me restate the general
equation for the exponential function
again e to the power of X is the limit
as n goes to infinity of 1 plus x over N
to the power of n we have now looked at
this special case of N equals 4
hopefully you can imagine that this also
works out for 40 or 400 four thousand
four billion for whichever number and
the result is it's 1 plus X we have that
already 1 + 1 x plus x squared over 2
you see not the closed for over eight
would be one half we've got 3 / 8 with
that for here plus X to the third power
over 6 plus X to the fourth power over
24 + and so on up to infinity to prove
this you need a better method then we
have used here you need binomial
but hopefully you get the idea where
this power series comes from and
actually it turns out that the six is
the factorial of 3 this 24 is the
factorial of 4 and so on so the general
term would be X to the power of n
divided by n factorial this also gives
us a way of computing e itself e equals
e to the power of 1 so we simply set X
to 1 which means e equals 1 plus 1 plus
1 over 2 plus 1 over 6 plus 1 over 24
plus and so on up to infinity and now
you can see how efficient this power
series is 1 plus 1 so we have two
already plus one half is 2.5 plus 1 over
6 equals 2 point period six you see we
are getting pretty quickly pretty close
to 2.71 something so if you actually
want to compute Euler's number or the
exponential function you're using this
power series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
