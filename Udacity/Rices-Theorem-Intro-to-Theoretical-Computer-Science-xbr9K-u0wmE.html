undecidability are somewhat easier than
showing NP completeness because
basically what we're doing is the
following we start out with saying that
for any computer program we can decide a
certain property and then derive from
that but then you could also solve the
halting problem and you've seen that
this works with a lot of properties so
deciding if a program will stop doesn't
work deciding if a program is equivalent
to another program doesn't work deciding
if the program even does what it's
supposed to do doesn't work even though
you might self feel somewhat cheated by
the original halting problem proof you
might be inclined to think that once you
accept that then there's actually not
much you can decide about the properties
of a program at least in general and it
turns out that that is exactly true in
1953 henry rice after whom rice theorem
is named proved that basically you
cannot use an algorithm to decide
anything about the properties of a given
program so we must be a little bit more
formal about this property X thing here
and henry rice used the notion of a
functional property here now what is a
functional property sounds very
complicated actually it's a very simple
definition any functional property has
these two properties first it describes
how the output relates to the input so
this is what we mean by behavior and
that is important how they relate to
each other not for example how much time
we need or something like that and the
second property is that there must be
some programs that have this property
and other programs that don't have this
property so that when you look at all
possible computer programs some of them
will have this property others won't so
that it can basically distinguish
between the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
