certain elements at the top of the list
such as those which were edited most
recently or that were created first
so when querying for records there are
four ordering functions in firebase
firebase can sort by children or
grandchildren keys values of a named
property or by its priority and key
together here or how these functions
work order by child allows us to order
by a specific descending key for example
if we have an item called desserts and
it contains an attribute for types of
sweeteners we can order all desserts
based on the children if your sweeteners
were white sugar
agave stevia coconut sugar honey and
molasses this would allow you to sort
them alphabetically so you'd have all
the agave desserts first followed by the
others with white sugar last similarly
in the 2.4 release of the SDK firebase
introduced what it calls deep path
queries put simply it's the ability to
order by any descending key not just
direct children so you could have
desserts and a child could be
ingredients and within the ingredients
object you can have a property called
sweeteners that you could then sort by
order by key order by key will order by
the key in ascending order by key name
to produce an alphabetical sort order by
value will order by the value of the
child nodes this type of sort can be
useful for numeric values order by
priority the order by priority method
can order by priority however well it is
still a supported method in firebase
it's not suggested it's a method that
was used before order by child existed
for each of these query operations there
is a defined order by which the values
or keys are sorted for order by child
and order by value the sort order is the
following return null a value will be
equal to no if the property doesn't
exist this is more pertinent for order
by child then return false true numeric
values then strings then objects why
differentiate that numeric values come
before strings the firebase database is
extremely flexible as to what type of
data contains for example there's
nothing to say that you can have a list
of desserts all with a child sweetener
where some of the desserts have a
sweetener value that is a number others
that have a boolean and still others
have a string it would be odd but at
least you'd know how it would be sorted
for order by key data is sorted in
ascending order with keys that can be
sorted as 32-bit integers first then
keys with a string value coming next and
as you might expect when you use order
by priority the sort order is primarily
determined by the priority and key one
point to note when you're implementing
sorts is that queries can only order by
one key at a time for example if you are
calling order by child multiple times on
the same query an error will be thrown
this is to keep firebase operation
snappy and get you the data fast now you
might be wondering what happens if I
need to sort by two things since
firebase doesn't support this yet the
best way to handle this is to use
sorting to do the first level of the
sort and then sort the data client-side
with your own Android code you should
also consider sorting client-side if you
already have the data available to you
because this will save you a query call
to the firebase database which will save
your users money on their data plans and
keep your database from getting pinged
as much you won't be implementing
client-side sorting in this version of
the app but it's an option you should be
aware of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
