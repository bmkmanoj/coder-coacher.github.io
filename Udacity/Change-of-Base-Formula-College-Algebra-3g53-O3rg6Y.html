property to combine either of these
pairs of logs since remember they have
different bases however let's try
grabbing our calculator and seeing if we
can add them to add log base 10 of 4
plus natural log of 5 I start out by
pressing the log button since I know
this has an implicit invisible ten down
here as the base we want log base 10 of
4 plus natural log so the Ln button of 5
and there we go we have our number let's
write it down so according to our
calculator log base 10 of 4 plus natural
log of 5 is about equal to 2 point 2 11
so on and so forth let's try our second
combination here so I've got my
calculator already and I just need to
enter log base 2 of 5 but wait there's
no log base 2 button what am I going to
do well I could use trial and air but
that would be really really hard there
must be something easier we can do
luckily there is there's something
called changing basis that we can do
what this means is that will convert log
base 2 of 5 to something with a
different base that we can evaluate
using a calculator so this is a formula
we can use to change a log from being
base a two base B we have log base a of
X equals log base B of x over log base B
of A this probably feels a little bit
confusing right now and kind of abstract
so let's try using it to see how it
really works let's do this first off
with something where you know the answer
just to make sure that our method makes
sense I'd like us to change log base 2
of 8 to something in base 10 first
things first though what is log base 2
of 8 equal to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
