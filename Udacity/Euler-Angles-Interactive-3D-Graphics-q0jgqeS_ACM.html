angles on the three J s object you can
rotate around the X Y or z axis
altogether if you're controlling a plane
the X rotation is known as the pitch
angle since it pitches the plane up and
down the Y angle is known as the yaw or
head direction since that's the
direction the plane heads Z is the roll
how much you're rotating around the axis
of the plane itself in some other fields
these angles are called the X roll Y
roll and 0 these angles are called Euler
angles when used together in this way
they're named after Leonard Euler a
Swiss mathematician and physicist who
lived in the 18th century he was one of
the most prolific mathematicians of all
time if you have ever run across the
number E that's called Euler's number
oil were invented using the Sigma sign
for summation just listing out his
accomplishments would take a whole unit
at least but you get the idea there's a
great quote from Euler that sums him up
for me when he lost the use of his right
eye he said now I will have less
distraction in three jas the Euler
angles are applied to the model in the
order Z Y and X I should mention that
this order can be different in different
applications for example the order Z X Z
is seen in robotics what happens if you
rotate around two or more of these axes
the short answer is that the frame of
reference changes for each rotation this
is actually easier to see than to
explain here I'm changing the X rotation
and you can see that the plane pitches
up and down now applying the Y rotation
notice that we're not rotating around
the world's y axis but rather around a
plane that is defined by the X rotation
in other words the Y rotation is applied
with respect to the planes frame of
reference not the worlds in fact all the
rotations are applied with respect to
the plane the initial X rotation just
happened to be aligned with the world
the Z rotation is also clearly changing
with respect to the planes orientation
rolling it along its axis oiler angles
are handy for flight simulators robotic
applications and even mobile
applications as they can be used to
describe the orientation of the mobile
device itself however Euler angles can
also run into limitations such as the
problem of gimbal lock for examples say
that I set the angle of rotation for the
Y
access to 90 degrees you can now see
that the X rotation and the Z rotation
have exactly the same effect we've lost
a degree of freedom under these
conditions limiting how we can move away
from this orientation I encourage you to
play with the Euler angles demo that
follows and get a feel for the strengths
and limitations of this method of
setting rotations definitely try setting
the Y angle to about 90 degrees to seek
gimbal lock in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
