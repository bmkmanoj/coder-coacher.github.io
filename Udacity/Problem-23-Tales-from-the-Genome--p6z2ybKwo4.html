set is a little bit tricky to gotta do
some math and think laterally here we've
got 1.5 million live births the number
of babies born with achondroplasia was
31 and of these 18 how to parent with
achondroplasia so 31-18 is what it's 13
that means 13 babies that were born to
conjure pleasure did not have a
hereditary version of it they had a new
mutation that happened and because we
know that achondroplasia is caused
specifically as a dominant allele right
you only need one mutation to cause this
we've got 1.5 million babies but they
have twice as many alleles right 3
million total alleles 13 of these
alleles were mutated to cause a dominant
allele which would then cause a conjurer
pleasure so 13 out of 3 million would be
the mutation rate for this now what
would be the mutation frequency in this
scenario we've already established that
because it's an autosomal dominant
disorder you only need one copy right
it's homozygous lethal so all these
individuals must be heterozygous that
they were born so in this case we've got
1.5 million live births but three
million alleles total and 31 alleles
right are these dominant alleles that
cause the Contra pleasure so 31 out of 3
million would be the mutation frequency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
