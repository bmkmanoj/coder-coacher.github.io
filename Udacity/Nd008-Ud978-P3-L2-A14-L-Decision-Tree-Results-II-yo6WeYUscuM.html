us a visual representation of that
decision tree and we can see how the
model was created and where it decided
to do splits and how many records fell
within each yeses and noes at each split
so the first split occurred based off
the spend was it greater than or less
than nine thousand five hundred and
forty-nine dollars based off of that
decision it will go either to a yes
bucket or this further split so if it
was greater than most likely they're
going to be yes what you can see is 6%
of the total records are greater than
that value and of that 6% 88% of those
so 78 records altogether fell within the
yes bucket so therefore we're pretty
sure that if they're greater than this
value they're gonna be
yes responders but if they're less than
that where do they go they go to the
stays per year split and there are some
records that fall within here but it's
not enough to determine hey do we need
to speak further splits or not so at we
can just keep on going down the list to
see where splits occurred and the
different number of records that fell
within that those different splits based
off of this model what was the confusion
matrix so what this is gonna show me is
that route me and error a root node
error which tells me of our total data
set which is that estimation sample how
many of them fell within the correct
terminal note or not
as you can see 92% were actually
classified correctly 97% of the noes
were classified correctly while only 68%
of the yeses were classified correctly
we had 32 percent of the yeses were
actually incorrectly classified as snow
and vice versa we're three percent of
the noes are incorrectly classified as
yeses so this confusion matrix
definitely helps us determine where
there might be biases within our data
are or if it's maybe skew to one side or
the other so we can see that this model
seems to be pretty
since it possesses an accuracy of 92%
now let's actually run this model
against a real validation sample but
first take a look at the following
decision tree interactive browse results
and try answering a few questions about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
