algebraically and I think that's the
best way to do it and I encourage you to
do it in the forms but since we already
calculated v-max numerically using the
numbers i had made up last time k equals
500 m equals 1 and x max equals zero
point two let's go ahead and get
ourselves an answer so how do we do this
why not that this system has some total
amount of energy once at the extreme
points the energy is all potential in
the equilibrium it's all kinetic in this
middle point here it's both kinetic and
potential I could phrase this
mathematically as the total energy is
going to be the kinetic plus potential
well the total energy is just whatever
energy ahead when I pulled it all the
way back to xmax the kinetic energy well
I'm not sure what that is but I know
this is the equation that describes it
and actually I know all of these numbers
except for V to solve this review is
just a matter of doing a little bit of
massaging which I'll leave to you when I
carry out all of this algebra and
arithmetic I find that when I'm at this
point when the mass is moving through
this position here the velocity is point
eight seven its maximum velocity
eighty-seven percent it's moving pretty
fast so my plot I'll go up to peer up
here and probably somewhere around here
now I could do very similar algebra to
find that there's also a negative
solution and this solution corresponds
to the exact same thing but when the
mass is moving this way I could also
find their solutions over here and if i
solve for the position when the velocity
was one half of its maximum i would get
point eight seven x max so I could put
points here and here can you see what
shape is starting to emerge and the
points we're plotting it's a circle or
at least it's supposed to be sorry some
my points are a little bit off this is
something in physics that we call a
phase diagram and it's a very powerful
tool once you understand how to use it
the way to interpret this diagram is as
follows we start with a mass pulled all
the way back to xmax we let it go well
in this case it starts with negative
velocity moves that way so that would
correspond to going into the negative
realms of velocity down here eventually
it maxes out in speed as it passes
through equilibrium but keeps moving to
the left as can be seen by the negative
velocity eventually it reaches this
extremum over here and finally it turns
around positive velocity moving to the
right passes through the equilibrium
maximum speed
keeps moving to the right and returns to
where it started the Wikipedia page and
simple harmonic motion has a really
great illustration now a couple things
to notice that are different about this
illustration position is vertical
velocity is horizontal the spring itself
is moving up and down but you get the
same idea here the vertical position is
tracking the object's position and as
the object moves downwards we see that
the balls on the left side of this line
corresponding to a negative velocity as
it moves upwards this balls on the right
side or spine to a positive velocity ok
so why did I spend all this time to show
you this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
