example so if we go back to the patent
example at all times you want to eat
ghosts eat dots eat big dots and avoid
ghosts they're sort of all happening at
the same time it's just at any given
point in time one of them happens to be
ascended ok yeah that example makes more
sense to me than the navigation example
sure but I think conceptually they're
the same it's just it's easy it's easier
to think about it in fact we actually
have a name for these kind of things but
we call them predator-prey scenarios
who's we you and me so here there's no
no no I don't call them that yes you do
this is a pretty well ok the literature
we there's a the literature's repeat
replete with examples of things called
predator-prey where you know you
basically want to go around eating as
much as you can but there's some
predator who's trying to eat you so
you're always trying to eat because you
have to eat or otherwise you die of
starvation but you have to avoid the
predator otherwise you die while the
other ones not dying of starvation and
pac-man is just an example of predator
prey right pac-man means to eat all of
these things meanwhile there are
predators out there trying to eat hit
and so they're kind of competing goals
happening at the same time I need to eat
I need to avoid being eaten and all of
these are really examples of that they
even use the word eat and avoid in them
so I need to eat my food and at the same
time I need to avoid being eaten and
occasionally because I live in a magical
world where suddenly rabbits become as
big as wolves I can occasionally eat the
wolf I see right but but once you think
about it that way you can stop thinking
about I mean so I'm not I want to make
I'm not trying to make a gigantic point
here other than we can think about
actions as actions we're executing or
you can think about these options as
things that are accomplishing goals and
this is where goal abstraction comes
from in my title here that really all of
these options are about accomplishing
different goals you're trying to always
accomplish those goals some goals are
more important than others at any given
point in time and options in fact really
make this sort of nice to think about
because of beta because beta captures
sort of the probability that we might
terminate in a state from this sort of
goal
abstraction point of view you could
think about this as either the
probability that I've succeeded in
executing that option that is I've
accomplished my goal or that another
goal has become important that I need to
interrupt whatever goal I was paying
attention to at the time that make sense
right so I like this notion of thinking
about options or thinking about actions
is always accomplishing goals and always
sort of happening in parallel options
are easier to think about then primitive
actions that way because in fact when we
define the options we I think we sort of
naturally think of them as accomplishing
goals that's sort of the whole point and
primitive actions are sort of so low
level they don't really have other than
primitive goals like moving left or
moving right they don't really have big
high level things that they're trying to
accomplish but options almost always do
that's why they're useful and that's why
people tend to come up with a Wednesday
to come up with or you know so it seems
to me and so we think about managing
goals then we actually end up with a
different way of thinking about this
problem and we move from a world where
we're worrying about sequencing and
hierarchical abstractions to a world
where we think about managing and
arbitrating between goals yeah so let me
let me write down different ways we
might do that because it turns out
there's a whole subfield that worries
about thinking about the problem this
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
