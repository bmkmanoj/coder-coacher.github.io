causes for mutations it's crazy it's
true we haven't even had time to cover
sequence inversions jumping genes or
cosmic rays and how other chemicals
cause mutations too why don't we just
stick to what happens to the mutations
when we have them and why is it that
some mutations gets passed down but
others don't well let's think about this
in a large population there are many
mutations or alleles that can persist
but the only way they can persist over
time is if they get passed down from
generation to generation so reproduction
is a selection point exactly it all
hinges on reproduction if you can't make
it to reproductive age then those
alleles or mutations aren't going to get
passed down so I've heard this term a
lot i'm sure you have to but it reminds
me of survival of the fittest I have
heard survival of the fittest is
actually a misnomer in biology is one of
the most talked-about myths so well
what's inaccurate about it well I want
you to figure this out take this
scenario let's imagine we have a group
of about five people out camping
together each with different alleles
that affect their leg muscle strength
and ability to run suddenly a hungry
bear tax the camp to eat one of the
campers and they scatter you tell me how
fast do you have to run to survive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
