enumeration Struck's and classes in
swift i want to play a game I'm calling
enum class our struct choose the right
type for the job
so for each type I describe we're going
to choose whether we should use an enum
a class or a struct the first one is a
triangle it has two properties an array
of angles and an array of sides and I
think we should choose struct this is a
simple type just a couple collections
with a few values each and one might
imagine that each time we make a
triangle we want two distinct copy to be
made also there's no need for
inheritance if we did one inheritance
for example for an isosceles triangle
and a right triangle to subclass from
triangle in that case we'd choose class
number two uiimagepickercontroller
source type this is the type that
indicates where images should be chosen
from when they're being attached to a
text message for example our biggest
clue here is that this source type has
three distinct values photo library
camera and saved photos album so we
should choose enum the
uiimagepickercontroller source type is
indeed an enumeration enums are
convenient four types that can be
described as one property with a finite
number of values here's another one
we need a type for a name object which
holds two strings a first name and a
last name again I would choose struct
because we're dealing with few
relatively simple values and we're
probably gonna want every instance of a
name to have its own copy let's go
through just a couple more let's say we
need a type to represent a subject in
secondary school this is a very
traditional school at which there are
only four subjects maths English Spanish
and science what would you choose for
this one again with a finite number of
values an enumeration would work well
this last one is a little more complex
here we need a type to represent a
student it will have a grades property
to hold an array of grades a name
property to hold a name a favorite
subject property which holds a subject
and a computed property to hold the
grade point average additionally there
are a few different types of students
high school elementary school and middle
school so we want those sub
types to be able to inherit from the
more generally defined student type so
what kind of type should we choose for
this one will one a class between
classes enums and structs only classes
have inheritance on top of that the
structure of this type is a little more
complex than you see in most structs a
struct could hold the data but it would
be unusual that ought to give you a good
start on stocks and enumerations be sure
to complete the exercises to deepen your
understanding of value types and
reference types and for more practice
choosing the right type for your needs
stay tuned to learn about how to expand
and customize the functionality of all
of these types with protocols and
extensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
