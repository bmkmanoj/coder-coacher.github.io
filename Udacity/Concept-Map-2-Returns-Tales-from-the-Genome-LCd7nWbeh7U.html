concept map we know that there are two
copies of the human genome in every cell
and cells make up tissues which make up
organs which make up the body cells
tissues organs and the body together
manifest traits which are influenced by
the human genome and we learned a bit
about traits in Lesson one so the human
genome resides in the cell and it can be
divided into the nuclear genome and the
mitochondrial genome the mitochondrial
genome has one circular chromosome /
mitochondria and there are many
mitochondria per cell now the nuclear
genome there's only one nucleus and one
nuclear genome per cell but each nuclear
genome contains 23 pairs of linear
chromosomes 22 pairs are called the
autosomes they're numbered based on
their size from 1 to 22 1 being the
biggest and 22 being the smallest but
one pair of the 23 pairs of chromosomes
are called sex chromosomes and these
determine the sex of the individual two
X chromosomes will develop as a female
and an X and Y chromosome will develop
as a male all chromosomes in a Cell are
made of nucleic acid wrapped around
histone proteins now there are two
different types of nucleic acid and one
of them DNA is what makes up chromosomes
the other type RNA we'll learn more
about in lesson 3 DNA is composed of
deoxynucleotides there are four
different types of deoxynucleotides that
all differ in which nitrogenous base
they contain there is adenine or a which
can base pair with thymine or tea and
cytosine or C can base pair with guanine
orgy now DNA is double-stranded and
comes in a helical shape but the
double-stranded nature of DNA is held
together by base pairs which are formed
by the nitrogenous bases and one human
genome one copy is made of 3 billion
base pairs of DNA
