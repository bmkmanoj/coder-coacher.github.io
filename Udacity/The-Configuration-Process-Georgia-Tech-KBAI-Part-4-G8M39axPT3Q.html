knowledge-based AI method for doing
configuration design the process starts
with some specifications these might be
the specifications of all the
constraints on this configuration
problem for example the constraints on
David's basement the output is an
arrangement model a model of the
arrangement of all the components with
components already known for example the
arrangement of David's basement in this
method for some configuration design we
begin with some very abstract and
perhaps partial solutions this abstract
and partial solution may be represented
in the form of a design plan so an
abstract injured or plan for basements
of houses each plan specifies a subset
of all the variables we assign values to
the variables in that plan the plan is
not complete a completed plan can now be
refined and expanded at the next lower
level the plan specifies more variables
we assign values to those variables now
that plan in the next level is complete
and we continue this iterative process
until we have a complete arrangement
model as an example if somebody was
building a residential home like David
is doing right now then the abstract
plan we deal with the number of stories
that the house will have once we assign
to the variable number of stories then
we get a more expanded a fine plan where
we have a plan for each of the stories
into an investment for example for the
main floor there might be a plan which
specifies something about the kitchen
area something about the living area
something about a bedroom area as we
assign value so the variables that
define the living area in the kitchen
area and the bedroom area this plan gets
completed and now we might refine it
further a more detailed plan for the
living area for example this abstraction
hierarchy is a diagrammatic
representation of these plans arranged
with different loads abstraction I begin
with the most abstract plan then I
refine them and expand them as I go down
as i said earlier in configuration
design all the components already known
nevertheless in some cases it might be
able to also select the components so
for example I might not only be able to
reconfigure the TV I might also be able
to
pick a specific kind of TV so this might
be a TV in general and a most specific
kind of key being a more specific kind
of TV and so on note that the arrows
coming here are two way arrows this is
intentional in particular let us look at
the two way arrows between the
arrangement model and the process of
configuration and the specifications and
the configuration process once this
process has yielded an arrangement model
then we can assess the arrangement model
and if needed go back to the process as
an example of the configuration process
says that the TV is 12 feet away from
the couch and we assess it and we
decided couch is too close to the TV
then we can go back to the process and
say make the couch more than 12 feet
away from the TV that then becomes an
additional specification here and this
is the meaning of the two-way arrow it
is not just that we start with
specifications in the configuration
process works to satisfy them but also
as the configuration process works and
results in solutions we can evaluate
those solutions and the specifications
may change this is a very common
property of all design one of the major
differences between design and problem
solving is there in problem solving the
problem typically remains fixed and we
come up with a solution in contrast in
design the problem evolves as the
solution evolves the problem in the
solution coil wall so we start with the
problem of satisfying certain
constraints but as the solution evolves
this evolution of the solution results
in the evolution of a problem as an
example let us suppose that if
configuration problem is to configure
the parts of a computer processor so
that the processor can work at a
particular speed you do so you come up
with an arrangement model but when you
evaluated you find that the processor
overheats in that case you maintain the
specification and say that the
specification is not only that the
processor should be fast enough but also
that it should not overheat this is an
example of problem evolution and
solution evolution now that the problem
is evolved you may come up with a new
solution for the processor design this
now is an example of problem evolution
and solution evolution so for an example
that might hit a little bit closer to
home from any of you as you've been
designing your agents that can solve the
ravens test you've done a process some
like this you start with some
specifications general specifications
that your agent must be able to solve as
many problems on the Ravens test as
possible you didn't start with an
abstract solution of just a general
problem solving process that you may
have been refined to be more specific
about the particular transformations to
look for or their particular problem
solving methods to use that got you to
your final result but when you ran your
file a result you may have found
something like it would work but it
would take a very very long time to run
weeks or months so that thing causes you
to revise your specifications you not
only need an agent that can solve as
many problems as possible but you also
need one that can solve it in minutes or
seconds instead of weeks or months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
