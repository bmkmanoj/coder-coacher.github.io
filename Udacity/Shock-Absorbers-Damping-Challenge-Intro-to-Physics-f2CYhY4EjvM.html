cycles it takes for the amplitude to
decay to 1/2 its original value we need
to know the relationship between the
amplitude and the energy value which we
know decays by 20.6% per cycle and this
relationship is actually given by the
potential energy equation when the
spring is most compressed or most
extended then the displacement away from
the equilibrium length is equal to the
amplitude a so at this point where the
spring is most stretched or most
compressed the potential energy is
exactly equal to 1/2 times K times the
amplitude squared now I should be
careful here the value here should not
actually be K it should be equal to 4 K
so this equation should actually be
equal to 2 K a squared and that's
because we have four springs down here
which can be effectively treated as one
spring with a spring constant of 4 K
which we saw in the solution to the
previous question so now I'm going to
substitute this value for potential
energy to ka squared and the value of 4
energy in our earlier equation and doing
a little math we get that the current
amplitude squared is equal to zero point
seven nine four to the N power times the
original amplitude squared now let's
remember what we're looking for we are
looking for the amplitude a that's equal
to exactly half the original amplitude
so we can substitute 1/2 a 0 for a here
and that gives us this equation here and
quite nicely the a zero terms cancel and
that gives us this interesting equation
up here that 1/4 equals zero point seven
nine four to the N power now depending
on how much math you've had you may
recognize that you can solve this
equation by using something called a
logarithm but we don't actually have to
use logarithms here it turns out that if
you go through trying different values
for n different integer values in
particular you'll find pretty soon that
the solution to this equation actually
is N equals six so this means it takes
six cycles six complete oscillations in
order for the amplitude of our spring
oscillations to decay to 1/2 their
original value great work if you got
this problem but if you didn't don't
worry about it either this was quite
challenging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
