of fonts a font family or even a family
of families can contain dozens of
variations first Roboto actually has
four distinct font families including a
condensed monospace and even an older
slab serif family within each font
family you have a variety of weights
font weight is the relative thickness of
each letter
the most common way to regular in bold
but really great fonts will come in
light thin regular medium bold or black
and now these can go by different names
like semi bold or ultra-thin weights
often also get numbers assigned to them
from zero to a thousand where the
thinnest weights have something like a
hundred value and the darkest or the the
thickest weights have a nine hundred or
thousand value and finally each of these
weights normally has a normal and an
italic style now when it comes to
styling texts in Android the terminology
is a little different if you're using
Roboto text views have two attributes
that let you customize the font font
family and text style font family lets
you choose which family to use and the
specific weight such as thin or light
and text style lets you choose italics
but it also lets you make the text bold
you should generally avoid using text
style to make text bold and instead use
the font family attribute since you'll
have more control over the exact weight
to use also note that not every weight
is available in every family for example
as of this writing Roboto condensed
doesn't include a thin and a black
weight here's some sample code for
applying a font family and text style
here we're saying to use the convinced
family but italicized and here are some
other examples of values you can use for
font family to set the font family or
the weight like thin medium and light
now one quick note with the condensed
fonts the Roboto condensed example here
you can squeeze a lot more text since
the same horizontal space with these
fonts but condensed fonts can definitely
be overused they're not quite as legible
and don't
always look great with other wider fonts
like robot irregular or you know even
wider fonts than that so definitely be
careful when using condensed fonts as
your font family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
