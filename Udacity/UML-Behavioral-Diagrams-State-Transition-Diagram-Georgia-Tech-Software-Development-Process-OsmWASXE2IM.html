discuss is the state transition diagram
the state transition diagram is defined
for each relevant class in the system
and basically shows the possible life
history of a given class or object so
what does it mean to describe the life
history it means that it describes the
possible states of the class as defined
by the values of the class attributes
and it also describes the events that
cause a transition from one state to
another
finally it describes the actions that
result from a state change so if you put
all of these together you can see how
this can represent the whole history of
the class from its creation to its
destruction so let me discuss the
transition diagram in more detail and
also provide information about the
notation used to represent them we have
states that are represented by ovals
with the name and we have transitions
marked by the event that triggers the
transition what transitions indicate is
the passage from one state to another
state as the consequence of some
external stimuli notice that not all
events will cause a state transition so
for example some events might be
consumed within a single state and we'll
get to that in a second but in most
cases an event will trigger some state
transition events may also produce
actions and they may also have
attributes which are analogous to
parameters in a method call and boolean
conditions that guard the state
transition that is prevented from
happening in the case the conditions are
not satisfied states may also be
associated with activities and actions
specifically activities are operations
performed by an object when it is in a
given state and they take time to
complete action conversely just like the
actions corresponding to an event are
instantaneous operations that are
performed by an object and can be
triggered on entry so when the object
reaches a given state when the object
exits that state and also when a
specific event occurs and in this case
this notation is basically a shortcut
for an event that will cause a state
transition that will bring the object
back into the same state since we have
several actions and activities it is
probably worth clarifying the ordering
of such actions and activities so the
way in which these actions and
activities occur is first of all we have
the actions on the incoming transition
so this is performed first then if the
resonant reaction that's the next action
that will be performed then we have
activity and event actions as
appropriate and finally exit actions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
