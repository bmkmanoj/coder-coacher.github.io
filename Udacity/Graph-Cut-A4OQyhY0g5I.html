graduate course intended for computer
science I'm going to assume you've seen
some form of an algorithms class and you
may have heard that there's something
called a graph cut algorithm and a graph
cut algorithm does exactly what you
think it cuts a graph so here I've got a
graph and the idea was originally it had
lots of connections in it and when I'm
all done I've decided to break this
graph on those four links to create two
different graphs a and B and they're
totally disconnected so those would be
two segments in our image and the idea
is that the cost of a cut is quite
simply just the cost of all of the
segments that you broke so that's what
this thing shows you here I take for all
of the if there's a P in a and Q and B
and I've separated a and B what's the
cost between all of those and a graph
cut would give you a segmentation of the
image so the question becomes what is a
good graph cut and how do you find one
so there are algorithms called min cut
algorithms sometimes called max-flow
because they're their duals of each
other the same that allow you to find
that segmentation in a relatively not
too complex a manner fast min cut
algorithms exist
so the original min cut Volcom folk folk
and Fulkerson you may have learned there
are subsequent more rapid ones we're not
going to go into those here all you need
to know is that you can go to your local
algorithms store and buy yourself a good
graph cut algorithm and the more you can
spend the faster graph cut algorithm you
can get the idea is that that would
partition your graph a problem though if
we just use min cut for doing
segmentation is that min cut by
definition is going to try to pull out
little segments that have as few
connections as possible so what it tends
to do is it tends to pull off very small
little segments because by definition a
little segment will only connect to a
small number of other nodes so really
what you want to do is you want to do
something a little bit smarter than that
and in fact what you want to do is
what's referred to as normalized cuts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
