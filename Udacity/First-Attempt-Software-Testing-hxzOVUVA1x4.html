was trying not to call attention to it
but what happens is when we add
something to acute that's not full I'm
an increment a counter similarly I'm
going to increment a counter when we add
something to a full queue when we remove
something from an empty queue and when
we remove something from a non-empty
queue and so let's see we want to make a
two-element queue to match my drawing
now let's run the random tester okay
here's what it tells us it did 33,000
and some ads to a non full q 16,000 and
some ads to a full q 33,000 who removes
from a non full queue and 16,000 removed
and some removed from an empty queue so
we can see is that that's at least as
far as that really crude coverage metric
goes and of course we could have got
similar information using a branch
coverage tool but this is a little
easier and more more general purpose
we've gotten good coverage of our cue
but now let's try something different
let's imagine that instead of our state
machine having just three states let's
say that we had a queue containing a
hundred elements so the dynamics are
going to be exactly the same except i'm
leaving out a lot of nodes in the middle
okay so we're still going to start at
the empty state we're still going to
randomly walk around our finite state
machine and the question is are we going
to get good behavioral coverage of our
cue in this case so let's take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
