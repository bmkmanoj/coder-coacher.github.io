entirely online only site and made it an
offline first progressive app by making
it to the end of this course you're
ready to take on any offline first
project Witter was specifically designed
to cover most of the gnarly edge cases
you'll encounter in the wild for example
cash versioning for big updates like
phim changes interactive updates to get
the user on to the latest version
dealing with server rendering by serving
a page skeleton responsive images
multiple caches you even had to master
index DB the most feared API on the
platform you did it all but to spell out
exactly what we achieved for the very
last time we dial into America land Mike
are you there I am sure why we started
and where we are now with pleasure if
the users on some kind of non perfect
connection they used to have to wait for
the page to appear an imagery took ages
now stuff appears on the screen
instantly life I users used to be left
staring at a white screen forever but
now they get content instantly offline
users use to get a browser air page now
they get content and a non-disruptive
custom error this is a huge improvement
in the user experience if your site
works offline first users are going to
notice that it loads reliably and fast
whatever the network they'll have a less
frustrating experience with your site
than the rest of the web and that's what
matters the user experience and with
that it's goodbye from me and goodbye
from me we look forward to a web that
works whatever the connection is
