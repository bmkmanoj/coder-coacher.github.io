customer segment part of the business
model canvas we talked about the jobs to
be done we talked about pains we talked
about gains we talked about multi-sided
markets and we closed with market type
let me give you an example of a couple
of startups who actually went and tried
to define their customer segments so
here was one that the startup was
actually trying to understand how to
find foreign students at universities
and so they were putting together their
archetype and this was just a definition
of meet this student and here's who they
are and here's their family and all this
is their first time in America and
because it was about providing financial
services to foreign students they
actually understood something about
their credit score about social security
number Us address whether they were
responsible academically and financially
and whether a social network was
responsible another example of a
customer segment was someone making new
kiteboarding equipment who were their
customers professional kite surfers they
solely concerned with performance but
they had another segment average kite
surfers and they had a third perspective
kite surfers and and though I don't
think they were this young they were
actually trying to understand how to
segment their market and what their
specific performance needs for kite surf
were in each segment the other thing
that we're interested in doing if you
remember in customer segments is
understanding the day in the life of a
customer now sometimes this could
actually be diagrammed this how did they
spend their time and this happens to be
how does a designer
spend their time putting together an
architectural product so how much they
spend in phase one and in prototyping
and manufacturing and final product and
so this was giving them a view of what
it would look like and so they can now
describe to me and others oh and our
product fits right here and here's why
etc here was another example of someone
trying to understand the customer
problem of couples who happen to be on
separate coasts or a long distance from
each other and they were trying to
understand what the problems were and so
they were able to articulate all the key
pieces
and kind of rank them by priority I
thought this was a great way to kind of
diagram the problem here was another
example of a team putting together in
detail the archetype of a set of
customers they gave their archetype a
named path the professional specified
who pat was uploaded we mobile
professional salary what they did how
much they spend what their demographics
are what their traits were what her
motivations were how many were there
where they worked where they bought etc
I thought this was a great example of a
professional class consumer who was
shopping frequently online another
example in medical devices trying to
understand two segments oncologists and
pathologists here's what they did here's
what they cared about and more
importantly here's how they paid here's
how they paid in the hospital
and here's they how they got reimbursed
here's another example of a mammography
product how patient care worked inside
of a hospital and how people got
reimbursed so you can find these
examples and more on the link below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
