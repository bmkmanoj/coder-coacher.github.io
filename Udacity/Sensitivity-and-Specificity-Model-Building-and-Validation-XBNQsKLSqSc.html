known as sensitivity and specificity
let's consider this diagram in this case
the circle represents actual positives
which is in fact a sum of the true
positives and the false negatives the
sensitivity is defined as the true
positives divided by true positives plus
the false negatives which are all the
actual positives similarly let's look at
all the actual negatives in this case it
is a sum of true negatives and the false
positives the metric specificity is
defined as the true negatives divided by
the sum of the true negatives and the
false positives in our example we were
classifying person F and person B in
this case we would denote F as a
positive case and B as a negative case
for F let us denote the true positives
which is the number of actual positives
that were classified or predicted to be
positives with TP let's denote the false
negatives which are actual positives
classified as negative with FN let's do
know true negatives which are the number
of actual negatives that are classified
to be negative with TM and false
positives which are actually negatives
classified as positive with F P also
remember in the language of hypothesis
testing where events are classified as
belonging to a null hypothesis or an
alternate hypothesis false positives are
called type 1 errors and false negatives
are called type 2 errors the accuracy is
given as the sum of the true positive
and the true negative divided by all the
cases all the cases are some of
everything listed here with this
notation we can write the sensitivity
and specificity like this sometimes you
will see
specificity written as one - the false
positive over the sum of true negative
and the false positive this essentially
gives you the expression above so now
you're familiar with the accuracy metric
the sensitivity metric and the
specificity metric for our poisoned wine
classifier we would want our sensitivity
to be very high that is we want to catch
almost all instances of poisoning for
the example that you showed in the quiz
this metric is less important for our
poisoned wine classifier the specificity
metric is less important since if we
falsely label a harmless wine as
poisoned it's not as dangerous for the
example that you gave we want the
specificity to be very high we will
return to the concept of sensitivity and
specificity and show you how to choose
between classifiers based on these
metrics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
