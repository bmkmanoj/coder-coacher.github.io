model canvas is a scorecard it's not the
class the lectures are not the class
we're not asking you as facilitators and
mentors to lecture in the class but to
do short summaries just to make sure
everybody's up to speed and ask probing
questions to spur conversation but the
class itself is about critiques about
each team's findings from their original
hypotheses to what did they actually
learn one of the things we do to make
the teams feel great is when someone
actually gets physically thrown out of a
customer just to remind students that
some of the most aggressive teams seems
actually spending their time trying to
get customer data sometimes have known
to get thrown out of buildings because
they've been so aggressive or you know
threatened with arrest because they
shouldn't be where they are we're not
asking you to break any laws or or do
anything illegal but you know you're
pushing hard when somebody physically
grabs you by the arm and escorts you out
of a place then you get in then you get
to show up at the class tell us that
story and the teaching team needs to
stand up and applaud that activity that
just means there was an aggressive team
now just to remind them we do not
provide bail or political asylum
depending on your country but being
passive is not the way to actually
proceed with this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
