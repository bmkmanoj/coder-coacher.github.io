like let's briefly look at how to
connect the dram to the processor so we
have a processor it sends its requests
to level one cache which sends its
misses and right back requests to the
larger level two cache which might send
its misses and right back requests to in
even larger level three cache and let's
say that these are all on our processor
chip now what happens is the misses and
the write-back requests from the l3
cache would be made over an external
connection so we need processor pins
here and traditionally this data would
go over what is called a frontside bus
now you want to design the processor
chip so that you can connect it to many
possible memories so you don't design
the frontside bus such that it supplies
the row address and column address and
so on to the memory chips what you have
instead is another chip that contains
the memory controller and that memory
controller will have what's called a
memory channel connecting it to a data
module and over this channel it will
issue things like open a row read
something at the data
write something supply the data closer
or open another one and so on
and it will usually have more than one
such memory channel so the memory
latency is seen by the level three cache
is not only the access time of the
memory array here it includes sending
the request over a frontside bus having
the memory controller figure it out
sending the page open to the appropriate
DRAM sending a request to read supplying
the column addresses and everything
getting the data over the memory Channel
note that you have a level three cache
miss that means you want a whole cache
line worth of data to read so it takes a
while to transfer that data here then
the memory controller reads it from the
memory channel which usually has one bus
frequency and sends it at a different
data rate over the frontside bus
to the processor chip which then puts
the line together and puts it in the
lottery cash so the latency includes all
of this here in addition to just the
memory access and this can be a
significant part of the overall memory
latency so recent processor chips
integrate the memory controller which
means that the memory controller is put
on the same chip as the processor and
the caches now we no longer need the
frontside bus we can use lots of on chip
wiring to communicate with the on-chip
memory controller so this can be plenty
of bandwidth and very very close this
whole thing is something like 2 by 2
centimeters and then we just send
requests directly through the memory
channels to DRAM so now the processor
chip directly knows how to talk to the
rams and open pages and so on which
dramatically can reduce this part of the
latency and because it's not a
negligible part of the overall latency
we get our data from theorem a little
bit faster actually 10 20 maybe 30%
faster than before
but the cost of that is that now we
designed a processor chip to talk to a
specific kind of DRAM and because of
that we need a relatively high degree of
standardization of data modules so that
for example when we go from 2 gigabyte
to 4 gigabyte memory modules we don't
have to redesign our whole chip so the
protocols here got a lot more
standardized and uniform and flexible
than before but in exchange we get to
transfer data very quickly between the
processor and the memory controller we
can make the memory controller now very
smart and then access memory in a more
efficient way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
