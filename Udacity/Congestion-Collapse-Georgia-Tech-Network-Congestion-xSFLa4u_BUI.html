traffic load suddenly results in a
decrease of useful work done as we can
see here up to a point
as we increase network load there is an
increase in useful work done at some
point the network reaches saturation at
which point increasing the load no
longer results in useful work getting
done but at some point actually
increasing the traffic load can cause
the amount of work done or the amount of
traffic forwarded to actually decrease
there are many possible causes one
possible cause is the spurious
retransmissions of packets that are
still in flight so in senders don't
receive acknowledgments for packets in a
timely fashion they can spurious leery
transmit thus resulting in many copies
of the same packets being outstanding in
the network at any one time another
cause of congestion collapse is simply
undelivered packets where packets
consume resources and are dropped
elsewhere in the network the solution to
spurious retransmissions is to have
better timers and to use TCP congestion
control which we'll talk about next the
solution to undelivered packets is to
apply congestion control to all traffic
congestion control is the topic of the
rest of this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
