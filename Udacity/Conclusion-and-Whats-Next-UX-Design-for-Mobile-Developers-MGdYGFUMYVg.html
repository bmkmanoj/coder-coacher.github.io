personas and use cases to always keep
our end user in mind yeah it's really
important to keep our persona and use
cases in mind as designers and
developers when we're prioritizing
featureless and figuring out what to
build how to build and when to build
because if we do don't do that we fall
into the trap off creating applications
either for no one or everyone or just
for ourselves both of which are really
bad options yeah I think we can really
consider ourselves design minded
developers at this point yeah exactly so
what's next in the process now that
we've talked about personas and use
cases and prioritizing feature lists
well what we want to do next is focus on
low res wireframing we talked a little
about a bit about that in Lesson one and
we're going to go into it more in less
than three and lesson three is going to
be all about the mobile user cuz after
all we are building Android apps and we
need to start thinking mobile first
