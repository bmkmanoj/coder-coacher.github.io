showing a binary image okay where you've
got a circuit with some leads that are
connecting it and some of those leads
have shown up well and some of them are
showing up well or maybe some of these
things are noise and you want to get rid
of them and here of course this is a
notional version of a binary image where
you've got ones and zeros so binary
image analysis is used in all sorts of
things we're just showing you sort of
document spec ssin but parts inspections
so you've got a part and it's supposed
to have particular property to it and
you don't wanna make sure there are any
holes that shouldn't be there or the
holes that are supposed to be there are
there mostly for two-dimensional stuff
also manufacturing you have some idea of
what the images are supposed to look
like but it's basically where is their
stuff and where is their not stuff is
what matters and so you can think of
those as binary images and of course
document processing where they where
basically if you think of it as just
black ink on a white background it might
be very fine but there's there's not
really supposed to be gray now those of
you know about anti-aliasing and though
that's to do with limited resolution
we're not gonna talk about that we're
just going to talk about sort of binary
images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
