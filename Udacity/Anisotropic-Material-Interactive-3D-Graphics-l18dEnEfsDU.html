rotate them it doesn't really change how
they reflect the light here's a material
where it does as he rotated the light
reflects in different ways the second
kind of material is called anisotropic
compared to isotropic which is how most
materials are good examples of
anisotropic materials are brushed
aluminum and velvet a simple way of
making a material anisotropic is to give
the object a pair of normals instead of
a single normal in this exercise you
start off with our energy balance to
Blinn Phong reflection model for a plane
what I want you to do is change the
single normal to be two normals as if
the material has grooves in it if you
look closely at the fragment shader
you'll see I cheat a bit I take the
fragments location and use its x and z
position to make these new normals I can
do this because I know the original
normal is mostly pointing up the y-axis
your job is to take these two normals
and use them instead of the original
normal basically you need to apply the
reflection model twice once to each
normal to keep things about the same
intensity make both of these
contributions be each just half as
strong I'd like to point out that GLSL
has the idea of a loop built into it
this should prove handy for this
exercise here's the result which even
though it's a hack looks pretty nice I
don't mind saying remember the major
rule of graphics is it just has to look
right one thing to keep in mind the
groove parameter when set to zero should
give a result exactly the same as the
original reflection model if it doesn't
you'll need to figure out what to fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
