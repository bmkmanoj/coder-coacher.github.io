states we need a media player object
that is initialized for certain audio
file then we can call methods on that
object to move between the states so we
created a media player object by calling
the media player dot create method
notice that this is using a factory
method instead of a constructor to
create our object if you recall from the
last course we learned about factory
methods as another way to create objects
so for example to create a toast message
object we've already been using the
toast dot make text factory method so to
clarify when you call the static method
you call it on a class and remembered
that has to be exact name of the Java
class now when you call a regular method
or one that's not declared a static you
can call the method on an object
instance of the class so this name can
change depending on the name of your
object variable to learn more details
about media playback on Android I highly
recommend ian lakes talk titled media
playback the right way if he gave at the
big Android BBQ conference you can find
the link for it down below in the
developer documentation for media player
the kree methods are shown here in the
public methods section so the choice to
use a factory method versus a
constructor in order to create new
objects was decided by the original
developer who wrote out this media
player code instead of having different
constructors on the media player class
the developer chose to have different
create methods that could have different
sets of parameters depending on if you
want to play an audio file included in
the app or stream that audio from
another data source like the Internet so
in our case we use this constructor so
create and it takes in context context
and our res ID of type integer so we
call this create method and pass in its
two inputs so the current context and
the resource ID for the file that we
want to play and the return value of
this method is a brand new media player
object so you may have noticed here that
the create method is a static method
just like how side variables belong to a
class and not to individual instances
static methods are methods that are
bound to the class itself so one need
advantage of this is that we can call
the methods without ever making an
instance of the class now if we were
turned back to the media player API
guide
and the code here we can call the static
method like this so we can use the exact
name of the class media player and not
need to use the name of an object
variable we can use the same dot
operator that we would use on an
instance and then follow it with the
name of the static method so we pass in
the context and the resource identifier
for the sound file that we want to play
so the media player needs a context in
order to access shared resources on the
device and to know what environment it's
being used in and after that we can tell
the media player to begin playback by
calling its start method so note that
this comment here points that there's no
need to call the prepare mat that
explicitly because the create method
already helps us prepare the audio file
for us so we can call the create method
and then immediately call the start
method and after that we can call other
media player methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
