operators with expressions like is 3
less than 5 or a 6 greater than 1 but
then in addition to our logical
operators we have all these comparisons
to keep track of another good way to see
how logical operators work is to use
them in combination directly with the
values true or false so instead of
checking is 6 greater than 1 which is
true I'll just write the value true and
its place and any other comparison you
come across can be simplified to true or
false as well and I can use these values
with logical operators let's take the
not operator which is an exclamation
point as an example the code not 6
greater than 1 is the equivalent of this
code not true because the expression
sixth-grader than one evaluates to the
boolean value of true and both
expressions evaluate to false because
the not operator turns whatever boolean
value it operates on into its opposite
value so not true becomes false and not
false becomes true next let's look at
the and operator for the and operator
true and true will evaluate to true but
false and true will evaluate to false
and this is because the + operator needs
both of its combined conditions to be
true for the whole expression to
evaluate to true so if just one or both
of its combined conditions are false
then the whole and combination will also
be false it might be helpful to think of
how logical operators like an and can be
applied to real life scenarios let's
take the weather as an example let's say
that if it's sunny and raining outside
then this will create a rainbow so if
it's true that it's sunny and it's true
that it's raining will create a rainbow
but if only one of these conditions is
true like if it's only sunny then no
rainbow will be created same goes for if
it's only raining and if neither
condition is true then still no rainbow
will be created the only way a rainbow
is created is if both sunny and raining
conditions are true and this is like
Helen and operator works to produce a
true value for an and expression that
combines two test conditions both of its
conditions must be true for the whole
expression to evaluate to true and in
any other
case the expression will evaluate to
false the or operator is a little
different the or operator only needs one
of its two combined conditions to be met
for it to be true so true or true
evaluates to true and so does false or
true and that's because at least one of
its combined expressions is true in both
cases only if both conditions it
combines our false will this whole
expression be false to understand an or
operator a little better think about if
you're trying to power and use your
laptop for your laptop to work it needs
to get power either from a charged
battery or from a power outlet if both
of these conditions are true if it has a
charged battery and it's plugged into a
power outlet your laptop should work
your laptop will also work if only one
of the conditions is true like if it's
only working off of a charged battery
and it will also be powered if you're
only using a power outlet but your
battery isn't charged the only time the
laptop won't get any power and won't
work is when both conditions are false
when it doesn't have access to a charged
battery or a power outlet and this is
like how the or operator works just like
your laptop can get power from a battery
or a power outlet an or combination will
be true if one or both of the conditions
it combines are also true and only if
both tests it combines are false will it
be false so now we understand how ands
and ORS work but what if we combine
these into longer tests here's a longer
expression that uses an end and an or
operator this could be read false and
true or true what do you think this
evaluates to in this case Java will
first look at the conditions that are
tied together with Ann's and then it
will move on two conditions tied to get
there with oars this is the order of
operations for logical operators so
we'll look at our false and true combo
first and say this will evaluate to
false because an and operator requires
both of its combined conditions to be
true before it's combination will
evaluate to true so this expression is
equivalent to a false value and what
remains is a simplified version of our
first expression false or true and we
know that an or only needs one of its
combined conditions to be true to
too true so this whole expression
evaluates to true and remember these two
are equivalent so our first larger
expression also evaluates to true but
what if we wanted to evaluate the or
combination first the true or true part
to override the order of operations and
make this or combination evaluate first
we can surround that part of the
expression in parentheses in Java will
always execute code in parentheses
before anything else so this same check
but with parentheses around the or will
be read differently in this case Java
looks at what's in the parentheses first
true or true and since at least one of
these two conditions is true in fact
both of them are true this or
combination evaluates to true in these
conditions simplify to false and true
and because one of these conditions is
false and their combined with an and
this whole expression evaluates to false
so even though these two expressions
look very similar the order of
operations makes a difference logical
operators make the most sense when you
get used to them with practice so let's
take a look at more combinations in the
next quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
