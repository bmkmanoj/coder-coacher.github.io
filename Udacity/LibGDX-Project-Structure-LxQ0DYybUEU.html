up let's open up the project pane by
clicking the tab at the top left or by
hitting command 1 if you're on a Mac by
default the project pane only shows the
source and resources that are relevant
to an Android build that can be nice
sometimes but for now let's use the
drop-down at the top of this pane to
open up the project view there we go now
we can see all the files and directories
in our project directory let's open up
the settings dock Gradle file this shows
us all the modules that make up this
project looks like this build has
desktop Android iOS and HTML modules so
that's where the code for each of the
specific platforms lives then there's
also the core module that's where we'll
write the code that will run everywhere
not all of these files and folders will
be super relevant to you but I want to
go over what all of them do just so that
there's nothing that seems magical in
here first the dot Gradle folder Gradle
is a very smart build tool and when you
ask it to compile something it checks to
see if it's already compiled that file
and if so it says that that compilation
task is up-to-date and skips it the dot
Gradle folder is where Gradle caches
that sort of information the dot idea
folder is where Android studio holds its
information about the project and the
state of the workspace it's just a ton
of complicated XML you don't need to
touch we already talked about the
Android core desktop HTML and iOS
folders then there's the Gradle folder
the Gradle folder works together with
the Gradle W and Gradle W bat files to
form what's called the Gradle wrapper
basically the point is that Gradle knows
how to download itself so you can
version control what version of your
build tools you're actually building the
project with it's something super fancy
you don't need to touch but it's also
why you didn't have to install Gradle in
order to build this project pretty cool
right
the git ignore file tells git which of
these files shouldn't be checked into
version control these consist mostly of
files that are user specific settings
like everything in the dot idea folder
and if build outputs like everything
that's in each of the build folders
where Gradle spits out its outputs
Gradle dot properties and local dot
property is store more Gradle specific
configuration finally there's
me file that explains all this in much
more detail so that's it that's all the
files in a libgdx project
nothing really magical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
