let's just go to high my name is
Kathleen and I work on the content team
here at Udacity in introduction to
Hadoop and MapReduce which we produce
with Clara we had the opportunity to
interview one of the founders of Hadoop
Doug cutting he told us a number of
stories my favorite was actually where
he tells us more about how he came up
with the name and the logo for the
course check it out in the following
clip so the name had who comes from my
son's toy elephant when he was about to
a friend gave him a little stuffed
elephant which he played with
incessantly and we overheard him calling
it something the strange word that he
invented and said Hadoop so I
immediately wrote it down cuz I was in
the software business and we're always
looking for good names and this one came
with a mascot even now my son of course
as 13 and expects royalties for the name
he he wants more credit he also accuses
me of stealing the toy at some point he
was using it in some kind of rocket ship
experiment and I had to rescue it and
now it lives in my sock drawer for
safety I hope you enjoyed the clip if
you want to learn more about how to
harness the power of big data using
Apache Hadoop and MapReduce go ahead and
check out the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
