can be rather inexpensive because again
it's you know casting with off-the-shelf
rubbers at the same time other aspects
of robotics are also approachable you
know the advent of the Arduino and all
the things that made to it is also
making robotics become very very
egalitarian so I think that soft
robotics just like many other fields of
robotics are becoming accessible to to
everyone and it increases the amount to
which you see inspiration in this world
because you know of people have
remarkable minds not just the ones who
have access to resources to use them so
lowering the barrier of entry means that
more people on the planet are
contributing to our technical technology
society and it's fantastic to see I was
at an academic robotics conference a few
weeks back and a very substantial
portion of all the presentations had to
do with soft robotics and you know why
is this it's it's the fact that there
are these insurmountable challenges in
the field of robots that that that
people can't solve unless you start
bringing in these compliance structures
and so now that people are starting to
realize the power of using this this
platform technology you know they're
starting to implement it in all manner
of systems and I think that that as that
understanding of the capabilities of
soft robotics grows the implementation
will grow and you'll start seeing more
and more of it in robotic systems to the
point where you know in a little while
from now I kind of feel like people
won't think twice about seeing soft
robotics
it will just be robotics where that soft
part was the coolest part I'm most
excited about human robotic interaction
so you take a look at collaborative
robotics and a lot of great people have
taken the approach of taking systems
that are made out of metal that move
fast that have a lot of aspects of them
that are fundamentally dangerous and
through good software and good sensing
you know building systems that could
lower the level of threat
from from the device so there are a lot
of interesting areas of soft robotics
that are being explored so as I said
before soft robotics think of it is not
just the actuators but the sensors and
both are being researched in an
interesting application spaces so if you
think about the soft actuators side of
it and going back to human robot
interactions there are people who are
building mechanical kind of heart assist
devices so imagine an LVAD of that you
know cups under the heart and can
compress the heart and pump blood that's
that's remarkable you have the ability
to circulate blood through the body for
someone whose heart isn't working in a
way where the mechanical parts never
actually make blood contact which is
actually a very substantial improvement
to the quality of someone's health so
that's a human robotic mechanical
interaction another example of that is
you probably have seen a whole bunch of
robot soft robotics hands where
actuators are laid on the back of a hand
and allow you to either a do rehab
exercises I myself once once hurt hurt
my hand and I had to do rehab exercises
they're very boring it kind of never
actually do them unless you're at your
physical therapists office and then they
yell at you for not doing them so
imagine a glove that you could bring
home and it was simple to use it kind of
wasn't an inconvenience so you had a
higher rate of patient compliance by
using this system which means a lower
chance of kind of surgical revision of
whatever was done to to mend you because
you're complying with your treatment you
have the capacity to take this soft
mechanical structure and incorporate it
with something that's more engaging than
physical therapy like you know a video
game that tracks your progress and kind
of rewards you for good behavior so you
know that's the sort of you know doing
that with a soft structure is a lot more
plausible than a hard structure and on
the far end of it by using fundamental
soft actuator technology you have
healthier people so that's very
interesting there's also the soft
robotic sensor side which you know you
could see in in wearables right right
now where
predominantly focus on sports
applications but and those are those are
fun and great applications but you know
skimming people's bodies with sensors
could have a lot of meaning for society
for example the world's you know world's
population is aging you take a look at
all across Europe and all across North
America and China and Japan and you name
it there's this inverted population
where everyone is towards the side of
the elder side of the spectrum where
they need care and part of that care is
understanding what's going on in a
person's body and we we don't have
enough people to do all that work so you
know using soft compliant sensing
structures to monitor here someone's
helped provide you real-time warnings
when something you know horrible has
happened I think that's a wonderful
application actually also brings us back
to mechanical soft robotic wearables
where something like the you know the
rehab glove I just described it also be
an exoskeleton that allows you to keep
living your life you know long after you
may not have the full physical
capability of doing so so when I think
of you know outside of of the gripping
solutions that that we deliver here of
great places that that soft robotics
need to be I think of wearable robotics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
