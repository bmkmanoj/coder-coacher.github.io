diagram what we have is a driver script
which in this case was just a sea
program we have a random test case
generator which is basically two lines
of code one of them computed it used a
random number to compute the number of
bytes to read the other one actually
called the read function the software
under test was the other function the
read all function that we wrote the
Oracle was implemented by a memory
comparison function that is to say did
the read all command actually read the
right bites from the file and so as we
saw the world the Oracle never detect an
error since the since we got the
function right and everything worked out
this case of implementing a read all
call that's a stand-in for read that
behaves better it's been on my mind
lately because I assigned this as one
problem on the final exam for my
operating systems class that my students
finished a couple weeks ago and it
turned out that many of the students
didn't implement the right code a lot of
times they forgot in the read all
command for example to increment buffer
so that subsequent calls to read
wouldn't overwrite the original call to
read and so I saw so many of those that
I decided I'd write the function myself
and see if it was hard and it was a
little bit tricky but it worked out and
that's why I thought it might make a
good example for you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
