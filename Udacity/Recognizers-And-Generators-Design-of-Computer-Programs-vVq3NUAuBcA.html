recognizer task we have a function match
which takes a pattern and a text and
that returns back a substring of text if
it matches or none and it's called a
recognizer because we're recognizing
whether the prefix of text is in the
language defined by the pattern there's
a whole other task called the generator
in which we generate from a pattern the
complete language defined by that
pattern so for example the pattern a or
b sequenced with a or b that defines a
language for different strings a a a b b
a + b b and we could define a function
that takes a pattern and generates out
that language and that all seems fine
one problem though is if we have a
language like a star then the answer for
that should be the empty string or a or
a a or a a a and so on and it's an
infinite set and so that's a problem how
are we going to represent this infinite
set now it's possible we could have a
generator function that generates the
items one at a time and that's that's a
pretty good interface but instead I'm
going to have one where we say let's
limit the sizes of the strings we want
and if we say we want all strings up to
n characters in length then that's
always going to be a finite set and I'm
going to take the compiler approach so
rather than write a function generate
I'm going to have the generator be
compiled into the patterns and so what
we're going to write is a pattern which
is a compiled function and we're going
to apply that to a set of integers
representing the possible range of
lengths that we want to retrieve and
that's going to return a set of strings
and so for example if we define pattern
to be a star we did that appropriately
and then we asked for
pattern and we gave it two sets one two
three then that should return all
strings which are derived from the
pattern that have a length of 1 2 or 3
and so that should be the set a AAA and
AAA a so now let's go ahead and
implement this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
