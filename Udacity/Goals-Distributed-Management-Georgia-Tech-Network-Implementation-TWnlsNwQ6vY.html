distributed management and there are
many examples where distributed
management has played out in addressing
we have routing registries for example
in North America we have Erin or the
american Registry for internet numbers
and in Europe that same organization is
called ripe DNS allows each independent
organization to manage its own names and
BGP allows each independently operated
network to configure its own routing
policy this means that no single entity
needs to be in charge and thus allows
for organic growth and stable management
on the downside the internet has no
single owner or responsible party and as
Clark said some of the most significant
problems with the internet relate to the
lack of sufficient tools for distributed
management especially in the area of
routing in such a network where
management is distributed it can often
be very difficult to figure out who or
what is causing a problem and worse
local actions such as Mis configuration
in a single local network can have
global effects the other three design
goals that Clark discusses are
cost-effectiveness ease of attachment
and accountability it's reasonable to
argue that the network design is fairly
cost effective as is and current trends
are aiming to exploit redundancy even
more for example we will learn about
content distributions and distributed
web caches that aim to achieve better
cost-effectiveness for distributing
content to users ease of attachment was
arguably a huge success
IP is essentially plug-and-play anything
with a working IP stack can connect to
the Internet there's a really important
lesson here which is that if one lowers
the barrier to innovation people will
get creative about the types of devices
and applications that can run on top of
the Internet additionally the narrow
waist of IP allows the network to run on
a wide variety of physical layers
ranging from fiber to cable to wireless
and so forth accountability or the
ability to essentially bill was
mentioned in some of the early papers on
tcp/ip but it really wasn't prioritized
Datagram networks can make accounting
really tricky throw networks
a much easier time figuring out how to
bill users payments and billing on the
Internet are much less precise and we'll
talk about these more in later lectures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
