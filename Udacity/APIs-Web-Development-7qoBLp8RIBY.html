in JSON or we can also get it in XML by
changing our extension and a lot of web
pages have this feature where you can
get their content in different formats
another good example is Twitter we were
to go to Twitter and do a search let's
look for Udacity we can see all the
tweets about Udacity now if we want to
get a JSON listing of this I happen to
know the URL we go to search twitter com
/ search that JSON Q equals Udacity and
now we get a JSON listing of the search
result that we were just looking at in
Twitter if you're writing web software
and you want to manipulate another
website or get that if another website
you know it usually just takes a little
bit of poking around to find their api's
you know the way I found this API is i
just googled for twitter api and this
was you know the documentation for this
came up i'll show you that real quick
this is whole page about um you know
Twitter search api one of the nice
things about when you're building
websites is if you have data you know
let's say you have a blog making your
blog so it supports RSS you know an XML
representation of its content may be
json representation of your content
allows other people to build software on
top of your website that that can do
cool things and so many large websites
Wikipedia Twitter reddit all support the
stipes of functionality and your
homework in this class is actually going
to be to add that functionality to your
blog that we've been working on just
something to be aware of most users
don't really see this side of the
internet right it's really only other
developers get to see these ap is and
these other formats for the content so
it's cool that it's all there and it's
good to be aware of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
