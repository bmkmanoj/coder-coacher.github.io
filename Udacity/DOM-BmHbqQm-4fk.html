single frame once the browser knows
which rules apply to an element it can
begin to calculate layout or in other
words how much space elements take up
and where they are on screen so here's
all the CSS that we want to apply and
layout turns this into a collection of
boxes like this in the tooling you'll
see this as layout the web's layout
model means that one element can affect
others so for example the width of body
typically affects the children's width
and so on all the way down the tree so
the process can be quite involved for
the browser sometimes you may hear
layout called reflow it's the same thing
the next step in the process is to talk
about vector to raster for example the
boxes we had before were vectors like
this just shapes but now what we need to
do is fill in individual pixels like
this and that's what a rasterizer is for
so this is the layout we had before and
these are the drawer calls that the
rasterizer will make to fill it in when
done it'll look like this but that's a
little too quick so let's step through
and see it build up the picture bit by
bit
so you can see these rectangles start to
appear then some text then we get a
shadow a white line a picture and
finally it type these up the tooling is
going to show you this as paint you may
have noticed in that previous list that
one of the calls was called drawbitmap
what we normally do is we send things
like JPEGs or pings or gifts down the
wire to our page but what the browser
has to do is decode these into memory
like this in the tooling you'll see it
as image decode potentially we're doing
something like responsive web design and
so the image may also need resizing
painting as you may have noticed just
now was done into a single surface
however sometimes browsers make multiple
surfaces called layers or compositor
layers and it could paint into those
individually so here I have a
and this masthead has its own layer that
means we can paint the content behind
and we can paint the masthead itself the
process of handling these layers is
shown in the tooling as composite layers
this must head is a layer but because we
have buttons for next and previous on
top of it
they are also turned into layers as well
in this course we're going to talk about
layer management to make sure that you
don't create extra layers by accident
now we can put all these layers back
together and so now we've finished
painting all the layers for our page to
be honest painting actually happens into
a grid of tiles like this
I mentioned it for completeness but it's
not something we get to control as
developers all of this happened on the
CPU the layers themselves and their
tiles will be uploaded to the GPU again
this will be included in composite
layers and lastly the GPU will be
instructed to put the pictures up on
screen and that in brief is how we get
from a single request all the way
through to pixels on screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
