between static friction and kinetic
friction applies to the rolling wheel
assume that the wheel first occupies
this position and then roads on toward
this position affection of a second
later this would be the distance covered
by the car that's marked the same
distance on the perimeter of the wheel
so if the wheel was rolling without
slipping
it would have rotated but this angle but
we want to study braking so there
there'll be a certain amount of slippage
between the road and the weird the road
will not turn by this complete angle it
will turn a little s there will be a
certain amount of distance left marked
in blue this leads to the definition of
wheel slip wheel slip is the ratio of
that missing distance to the distance
traveled by the car if we have perfect
rolling there won't be any difference
the wheel slip becomes zero we won't
move at all the blue distance equals the
red distance and the wheel slip becomes
one now one can study how friction
depends on wheel slip if the wheel slip
equals one the wheels are locked
they don't move north respect to the car
they slide on the street which means
that we are in the regime of kinetic
friction the coefficient of friction may
be less than optimum if the wheel slip
equals zero the wheel is rolling
perfectly and the car only experiences
the rolling friction which is so small
that we neglect it here and simply set
the friction to zero when there's just a
slight amount of slippage between the
wheel and the surface the wheel develops
the maximum friction in what's going to
follow we are working with one single
curve to describe how the coefficient of
friction depends on the wheel slip
actually that's far from true with a
higher speed of the car friction will be
reduced and of course if there's water
or ice on the street we see a very
strong reduction of friction to keep
things manageable however we're going to
stick to one single curve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
