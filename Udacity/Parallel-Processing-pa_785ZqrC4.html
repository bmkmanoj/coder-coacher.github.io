multi-threaded programming this lesson
begins with a brief review of parallel
programming in general and moves on to
discuss multi-threaded programming in
particular it uses the POSIX threads
library as the canonical example though
the same principles apply to most all
threads libraries to motivate parallel
programming consider the following tasks
you are given a set of webpages some of
which link to each other will draw this
using the standard abstraction of a
directed graph where outgoing edges
represent links so web page a here
contains a link to a web page B and our
goal is to figure out how many links our
website say U has pointing to it this is
something that a search engine might do
to help figure out how popular our
website is now there's no way to know
whether another web page has a link to
our web page in it without looking at it
so in one way or another we're gonna
need to read all of the web pages in our
collection and if we try to do this with
a single processor this could take a
long time
first I have to read web page a then web
page B etc thankfully this task is
highly parallelizable that is there is
nothing about my processing of a ie
counting how many links it has to a
website you that affects how I'm going
to process website B or website C so I
can easily divide up the web pages
amongst a3 CPUs let's give these over
here to CPU one these two CPU two and
these two CPU three now we can let each
CPU count off in its sub group how many
links it has to you and then we can just
add these numbers up to get our final
answer returning to our time graph we
see that with three CPUs we only need
one third of the time potentially with n
CPUs we would only need one end of the
time it's important to realize that
we're doing the same amount of work here
suppose that in our original thread we
first processed the website to sign to
CPU 1 then those assigned to CPU - and
then those assigned to CPU 3 well in
parallel programming we've cut this one
long strand of computation into three
shorter strands and arranged them in
parallel by giving them to three
separate CPUs this of course is the
ideal case for parallel programming now
of course in real life we don't always
get as many processors as we want they
aren't always available
given that our application will likely
be running on the same machine as others
we don't know exactly how many
processors we will have access to but by
expressing our algorithm in this way we
can take advantage of the processes we
do have and thus make our algorithms run
faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
