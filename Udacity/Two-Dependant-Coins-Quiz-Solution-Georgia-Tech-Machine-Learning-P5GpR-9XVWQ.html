probability now since a and B are both
dependent on each other there are only
two possibilities both can be heads or
both can be tails so the joint
probability is also 0 point 5 what is it
what is the conditional probability the
conditional probability is given as
probability of a comma b upon
probability of P so conditional
probability is 1 now what is entropy of
a it is similar to the last example
because we are still using fair coins so
the entropy of a is 1 the entropy of B
is also one what is the joint entropy
between a and B okay let's use this
formula and see if our answer changes
okay the joint entropy comes out to be
one which is different than our last
example what is the conditional entropy
the conditional entropy is given by this
formula let's substitute the values to
find out what we get okay the
conditional entropy comes out to be 0
what is the mutual information between a
and we subtract the entropy of a and the
conditional ropey of a given 0 which is
one minus zero which is one so the
conditioner so the mutual information in
this case is one while in the previous
case it was zero so since this coins are
dependent on each other there and
immutable a it gives us some information
about the random variable B this tells
you how info mutual information works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
