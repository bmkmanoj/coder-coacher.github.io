answers here the first one is indeed
that randomized algorithms are in some
way more difficult to trick into a
worst-case behavior than deterministic
algorithms now to illustrate this for
example think about the greedy algorithm
that we use to approximate vertex cover
we could trick that approximation
algorithm into a verse case behavior
simply because we exposed the way that
it works and we knew how it would work
because it works deterministically for a
randomized algorithm of course we never
quite know what it is going to do so
constructing a worst-case instance or
finding an instance that really exposes
worst-case behavior here might answer
might be more difficult and for
deterministic algorithm randomized
algorithms can definitely be easier to
analyze and deterministic algorithms
although of course this one is a little
bit debatable since statistics and
probability can also get very nasty but
when you get down to search tree
analysis versus the analysis of random
algorithms and with what probability
they produce the correct results usually
these over here are easier and we also
add that in the last quiz where I
mentioned it now finally a random
algorithm does not explore solutions
that a deterministic algorithm would
miss rather it's the other way around
the deterministic algorithm at least if
it's not an approximation algorithm will
always guarantee that you find a correct
solution on the other hand with a
randomized algorithm you know about your
probabilities because you're demanding
guarantees but nevertheless you can
never be one hundred percent sure you
might be 99.9999 % sure that it produces
the correct answer but never 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
