the web team at Google in this course
I'm going to teach you the fundamentals
of progressive web apps and you're going
to put your new skills to work building
your own progressive web app progressive
web apps are experiences that combine
the best of the web and the best of apps
they give users the kind of reliable
fast and engaging experience that
they've come to expect from native apps
but delivered through the web they're
reliable and low quickly even on slow or
intermittent networks or when there's no
network at all they're fast and scroll
and animate smoothly they're engaging
sending relevant push notifications to
users and they're integrated showing up
on the home screen and loading as a
top-level full screen app in this course
you'll learn how to architect a single
page app using the app shell model which
separates content from the data and how
to ensure that the app gets data on
screen as quickly as possible then we'll
dive into service workers you'll learn
about different caching strategies and
how to choose the most appropriate one
for different needs by the end of the
lesson your progressive web app will use
a service worker to cast the app shell
and the data so it will work whether
you're online or offline finally you'll
learn the ins and outs of how to make
your app installable via the web app
manifest all of these features are built
entirely using progressive enhancement
they will light up and be available to
users who have a browser that support
them well other users will still get a
standard experience so let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
