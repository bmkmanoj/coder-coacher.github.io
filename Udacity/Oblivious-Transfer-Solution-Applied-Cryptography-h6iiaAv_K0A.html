meaningless as long as we have a good
random distribution here when we raise a
to the e power and the reason for that
is this value now V would be X 1 plus R
to the mod n that's because xB is X 1 so
the value for K 0 is that minus X 0
raised to the D power mod n there's
nothing that gets rid of this random
value and there's no reason this would
be a meaningful value the value of K 1
though is meaningful and it's in fact
the value of R and the reason for that
now the value of K 1 is equal to the
value of V minus x1 so that removes the
x1 from that value so that means the
value of K is R to the mod n raised to
the D power mod N and this is exactly
the RSA decryption that will give us the
value of the message which in this case
is equal to R so that means Alice has
now learned the random are selected by
Bob and its value is stored in one of
these keys she doesn't know which one
the value of K 0 is meaningless it's a
meaningless value that can't be
determined by Bob because Bob doesn't
know the value of D so that's the
important thing that we've done here is
now Alice has these two keys depending
on what value Bob picked one of them is
meaningful it has the value R the other
one is not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
