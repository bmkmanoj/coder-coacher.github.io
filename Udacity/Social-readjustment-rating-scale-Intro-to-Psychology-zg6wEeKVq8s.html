looked at different types of life events
that could be considered stressors each
event could be scored on a range from 10
to 100 depending on how stressful it was
at the top of the list we see death of a
spouse being the most stressful life
event at the bottom of the list with a
rating of 11 we see really minor legal
violations and with a rating of 12
there's Christmas so here we see that
holidays are even on the scale of
stressful life events although they
aren't necessarily bad things so this
shows that even positive things can be
stressful have you ever heard the phrase
I need a vacation from my vacation
that's just another example to show that
stress is not just associated with
uncomfortable or unwanted things like
divorce or death of a spouse it's also
associated with what we consider to be
positive or fun events like vacations or
holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
