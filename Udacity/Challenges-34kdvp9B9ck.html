some early computer vision data sets we
don't typically take an object put it on
a piece of black felt or velvet on top
of the table and say okay that is a fire
truck toy right pictures show up more
like this and i think this also comes
from kristen because she is a thing for
pandas and i think also for koalas all
right you get great variations in how
things are illuminated the pose of
objects the objects are sort of seen in
the background with a bunch of clutter
they get occluded so here you know those
trees in the way you know the viewpoint
and then oh isn't this a really cute
face of a koala yeah but you know what
to another koala he might not really
like this guy because he like ran off
with his poker chips or something I
don't know the idea is that you know
they look different one to another so
the idea that we have these variations
in appearance the other thing is that
these objects don't show up again in
isolation they show up in these
cluttered overlapping environments you
know here's this picture of these two
motorcycles one behind the other people
of course walking pedestrians we don't
get to look at objects in isolation
typically another thing that makes this
hard is the importance of context and
let me show you three pictures okay so
you take a look at these pictures and
you probably see a person here talking
on his cell phone you probably see here
an outdoor scene with a building and
like some people standing it said or
whatever you probably see some guy I
don't know exactly what he's doing
bending down maybe picking something up
and here is his shoe over there right
right well hmm you see these regions so
that the phone the person the shoe you
see this single picture here let me blow
up that picture a little bit more okay
this patch of intensities is the same
patch here as here as here as there so
what's a cell phone and one image is a
shoe in another image and that could
only be done by the context of
everything else that's around it this
also makes recognition difficult another
challenge is the complexity that is we
need to be able to compute things and do
it relatively quickly because you know
there are thousands now now millions of
pixels in an image we have got by don't
know
3 2 30 some tens of thousands of object
categories we have all sorts of degrees
of freedom of pose yeah that was cute i
know right so even though it's just a
person a person can move in many shapes
although i can move in many fewer shapes
and i used to be able to move and
there's so many pictures right there are
billions of images indexed by google
search the last number i could find was
that in 2011 6 billion photos were being
uploaded to various things per month ok
there was a billion camera phone sold
last year ok so they all take pictures
and another interesting indication of
the complexity of recognition and a
vision in general is how much of your
brain and my brain too by the way is
devoted to visual processing there are
different estimates anywhere from a
quarter of your entire cerebral cortex
to a half and it's the cerebral cortex
that sort of distinguishes you from an
awful lot of other mammals so the
recognition the ability for you to
manipulate things so well visually seems
to be two things very intense it takes a
lot of wet where in order for you to do
it but I guess evolutionarily it must
have been very useful because you
devoted an awful lot of wetware to
handling this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
