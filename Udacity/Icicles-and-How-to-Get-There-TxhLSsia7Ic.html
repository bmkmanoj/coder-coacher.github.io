level you learned a little bit about
game engines gaming platforms how to
break a game down into its component
parts and how libgdx allows you to write
cross-platform games finally you made
sure you were set up for success in this
course well sorry for making you stare
at my face so much in this level that
won't be a problem in future level since
you'll actually be programming instead
of staring at me in the next level
you'll set up your tools load up your
first libgdx project and get your first
game running on your computer and on
your phone the next two levels are all
about drawing you'll learn about the
computer drawing pipeline draw some
simple shapes and to spice things up a
bit
we'll also be drawing some fractals
level 5 is all about making those shapes
and move around the screen we'll learn
about the game loop and we'll also set
up some cool fake physics in level 6
we'll learn how to handle user inputs
including touches key presses and device
orientation level seven and eight will
wrap together everything you've learned
so far into the finished game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
