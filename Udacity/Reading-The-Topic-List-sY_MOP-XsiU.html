Piazza is reading from the home screen
of Piazza you can read any of the topics
on the left just click the topic to load
it in the main window the numbers on the
topics indicate how many updates there
have been since you last viewed the
topic you'll notice that the topics are
flagged with other information as well
this icon with the four lines indicates
a topic is a note that means that the
topic is more of a discussion not a
question in answer this icon with the
three bars is for a poll where you can
vote on something if the topic is a
question it will either appear in red if
it is unresolved or it will have icons
showing it has been resolved by a
student or instructor for example this
question is unresolved we can see there
is no answer provided and so it appears
in red on the left a yellow eye icon
means that the question has received an
instructor's answer a green s icon means
that the question has received a student
answer for example in this topic we see
the question has received both
instructor and student answers so both
icons appear a checkmark on top of the
green s means that an instructor has
endorsed a student's answer there may
also be some flags on the left side of
the topic list this flag means the topic
or question was posted by an instructor
this flag means the topic is only
visible to you and the instructor this
flag means the topic is only visible to
a particular subgroup like a project
group or a study group finally there are
also flags below the questions sometimes
an instructor will endorse a question or
note as a good note and this will appear
unresolved
ups are also noted below these refers to
the follow-up discussion which we'll
talk about in a bit
many of our OMS classes can have several
hundred students in them and as such the
topic list can get very large and can be
pretty overwhelming but remember there's
not usually nearly as much content there
as there actually appears to be but two
kind of way through it I'd like to show
you one of my favorite features it's
hidden kind of under menu in Piazza it's
the archived feature to get to the
archived
feature mouse over a topic and then
hover over the arrow that appears on the
left then come down to archive click it
and the topic will no longer appear in
your topic list archiving a topic will
remove it from your topic list but it
won't remove it from everyone else and
archive topics are still available to
you in a way we'll talk about a bit
later but it won't be there to clutter
up your view so if you're reasonably
sure that a topic isn't gonna have any
updates that are gonna interest you or
if you feel like the topic has reached
its logical end
feel free to archive it like this to
keep it out of your way you can also use
this menu to subscribe to email updates
for thread by clicking follow or to mark
a thread as unread if you want to make
sure to come back to it later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
