particles and some of the effects
achievable you can create all sorts of
animations with particle systems here is
an abstract presentation by altered
qualia which includes varying the sizes
of particles over time objects can also
be formed out of particles in this demo
the models are represented by particles
instead of wireframe triangles allowing
interesting transformations to occur
sets of particles can be used for all
sorts of animations such as this one of
a firework admitting sparks as it goes
by overlapping particles you can get
fuzzy effects of course you can always
make fireworks themselves here's how
animators preview some effects particle
systems are often set up with guidelines
either fixed or with some randomness
rules include elements such as when a
particles created what path it travels
and whether it disappears after a
certain duration the path could be hand
animated or controlled by the laws of
physics or even a bit of both another
common use is to have large collections
of particles simulate smoke water or
other phenomena your particles are shown
with a fountain effect the particles
don't have to be small they can be
objects in their own right such as these
dandelion seeds being blown away by the
wind we can also create particles that
are random 3d fragments which act as if
they're generated from a collision even
effects such as sparkling logos can be
done by animating particles here's the
preview followed by the final offline
rendering or you can simply use
procedural methods to create amazing
scenes it still astounds me how many
particles you can animate and render at
once in this demo by altered qualia
there are a hundred and fifty thousand
rotating 3d cubes being thrown at the
screen and i'm getting a frame rate of
twenty eight frames per second the whole
particle system evolution itself
creation movement and extinction can now
even be calculated entirely on newer
GPUs this allows more elaborate
animations while also freeing up the CPU
for other work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
