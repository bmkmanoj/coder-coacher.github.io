design process I mean I've heard of this
thing rapid prototyping how does that
what's that all mean as far as 3d
printing the real hindrance with 3d
printing right now is scale it's very
cost prohibitive to print things that
are very large in scale we have a
motorcycle in the gallery but that's a
pretty big print and it took a lot of
time and so there's this other idea out
there called rapid prototyping and there
you see products like 1 2 3 make things
that take very large objects like this
elephant or last year were for maker
faire we did 12 foot tall Trojan horse
out of cardboard and it takes those big
elements and it takes them out into
folded panels or it takes them out like
as you can see in the octopus in the
background in the sliced cardboard
cut-out so we can use something like a
laser cutter to make things very large
very quickly so it's just a matter of
time so right I usually think of 3d
printing because since you're doing
layer by layer by layer that can take a
while yeah the higher resolution you
have I would think the more layers you
have to put down yeah it's a really
interesting time too because the the
high-end 3d printers are extremely high
res and very slow and very high cost and
the consumer grade printers things like
a MakerBot or a typing machine they're
extremely low res and very fast and but
their cost is kind of going up and the
high res stuff the cost is kind of going
down so I think in the next couple years
we're gonna see a meet in the middle and
you're gonna end up with this great
device that almost anybody can use and
give you know a print that is very
usable for multiple things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
