question of is a program of virus is a
question about the program's behavior as
I have defined it also some programs or
viruses and some aren't so this can't be
decided in general we can look for
specific viruses and we can monitor the
behavior of programs for suspicious
activity doing this is a billion-dollar
industry but we're never going to get an
all-purpose virus detector nor am I ever
going to be able to write the perfect
test code to see if the Turing machine
that you programmed to decide balance
strings actually works i can write test
cases and detect common errors but i can
never decide completely whether your
programs are right or wrong on the other
hand i can write a program to test
whether your reduction of HTM to the
language of Turing machines that accept
nothing is decidable I simply reject
remember that no such reduction can
exist because HTM is recognizable and
etm is co recognizable and lastly this
question about whether a program will
halt in 10 to the 200 steps is decidable
I just run the program for up to that
many steps of course that number is so
large that in practice even on the
fastest computers the heat death of the
universe will have occurred by then but
nevertheless the question is decidable
the reason Rice's theorem doesn't apply
here is because this question is about
machines not about languages the purpose
of this quiz is not to tell you that
undecidability is a concept with no
practical implications rather is to help
you to see what it does and does not
tell us just because a problem is
decidable doesn't mean that it's
tractable or practical to solve also
just because a question is undecidable
in general doesn't mean that we can't
write programs to tackle specific cases
as we do every day with malware
detection and software testing it does
however say that we should not expect an
all purpose solution and any attempt to
achieve that end is doomed to fail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
