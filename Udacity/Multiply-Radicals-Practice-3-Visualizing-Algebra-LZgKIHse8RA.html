answer is 2 plus 2 times the cube root
of 6 great thinking for getting those
two correct now these are a little bit
tricky because you had to keep in mind
we had cube roots we can multiply these
two radicals together since the indexes
match so we'll get 27 x cubed the factor
of 3 appears three times underneath the
radical as is the factor of X this means
we pull out 13 and 1x to get 3x this
should also make sense we've seen the
cube root of twenty-seven before and we
know that's 3 and using power divided by
root will have 3 / 3 which is X to the 1
for our second problem we'll distribute
the cube root of two to each of these
terms so we'll have the cube root of 8
and the cube root of 48 we know the cube
root of eight is simply too and we can
split up the cube root of 48 into the
cube root of a times 6 we use our
product rule to split this up in the
cube root of eight times the cube root
of 6 and simplify once again to get our
final result you might not have always
shown this step throughout your problem
solving and that's okay you just really
want to be careful when you take cube
roots of numbers put the factor on the
outside and leave anything else inside
the radical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
