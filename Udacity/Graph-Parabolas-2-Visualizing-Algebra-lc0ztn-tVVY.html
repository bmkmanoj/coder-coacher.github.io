right here nice work if you got this
correct just like before we'll take our
equation and we'll try to complete the
square this time for the y terms the B
value here is negative 6 so B over 2 is
negative 3 and B over 2 squared equals 9
the square of this number so we know we
need to add 9 in order to make a perfect
square here but I can't just add 9 to an
equation since i'll change it so if i
add 9 here i should also subtract 9 that
will make it balanced I really added 0
we rewrite this part as a perfect square
and now we can just combine these two
numbers on the end this gives us an
equation in vertex form and notice that
it's x equals so we know the parabola
will open to the left or to the right
since there's a positive one in front of
our square term we know that a is 1 so
our parabola opens to the right for a
horizontal parabola the x coordinate of
the vertex is here it's H the y
coordinate of the vertex is K and it's
here it's positive 3 we can find the Y
value of the vertex by setting y minus 3
equal to 0 so we know X is positive 2
and y would be positive 3 now that we
have the vertex let's figure out how to
graph our parabola and know that it
opens this way the a value is always in
front of the squared term so a here is
still positive one so let's zoom in on
our vertex and figure out how to graph
those other two points here's our vertex
at 2 comma 3 and now we go a units in
the X direction so we'll go one unit up
and one unit down from our vertex and
then we'll go one unit right and one
unit right this gives us our two other
points at 3 comma 4 and 3 comma 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
