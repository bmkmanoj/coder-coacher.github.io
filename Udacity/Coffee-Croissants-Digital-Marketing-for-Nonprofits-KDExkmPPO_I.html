glitch which is really just proof that
we're here life so I would like to
introduce you again to Wendy who is
Wendy placencia I was joining me today
for our coffee and croissants where I
get to talk to marketers in the field so
welcome again Wendy and you're part of
the organization of the Boys and Girls
Club in Silicon Valley so can you tell
us a little bit about your role there
sure so I do the market I'm a marketing
manager for Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs Silicon
Valley my role is to do all the digital
marketing campaigns websites anything
that has to do with information that
goes out into the into the community and
things like that
very cool so and how did you kind of get
into this role like what has your career
journey until now look like I started
working in youth development programs
and I was 18 years old and I absolutely
fell in love with working with youth
development programs but I also really
love doing marketing in public relations
and so I was going to school at that
same time and I needed an internship and
unfortunately for me our organization
was was hiring interns in our public
relations and marketing department and
our resource development and I started
to do our marketing with them throughout
my internship and I was there for a year
and I really fell in love with it and I
fell in love with being able to really
tell the story of our organization from
a marketing standpoint and so I ended up
switching over from the youth
development perspective over to the
marketing standpoint very cool and how
long have you been in this role I've
been in this specific role with for
three years Wow very cool so yeah so we
just watched this video that kind of
explains a little bit more about the
organization but I think it also kind of
highlights some of the differences
between marketing a product versus
marketing a cause and maybe you can tell
us a little bit more about that sure so
marketing a cause when you're really
marketing cause you really have to tell
the story of what caused your you're
going after with us it's really kind of
showing and highlighting the youth that
have gone through our programs
there they are in lower income areas
they might be struggling with things
that are a lot harder in their lives but
because we have the Boys and Girls Clubs
in our area they're able
to have resources that they may not be
able to have at their schools or be able
to afford in their communities and so
what we really wanted is to be able to
showcase the impact that these programs
that our organization has on these youth
that they're able to go through life and
use the same skills and those same tools
and now apply them to you know perfect
examples Armando and you know is now in
college at Stanford his first time using
a computer was in our Clubhouse because
he couldn't afford or did wasn't able to
have those products at home and now he's
at Stanford studying computer science
and engineering and so it's just our in
economics and so it's one of those were
when you're showcasing and when you're
using marketing cause marketing you're
really showcasing you know the story
that's behind what your cause is and it
really comes from a passionate part
versus when you're doing the marketing
of a product you're really looking at
like what is the you know sell me this
product why should I have this product
you know I love using you know the cell
phone why is this cell phone better than
that cell phone and so it's a different
it's different standpoint and so it's a
matter of finding where it is that you
want to fall in when you do marketing
and what you can really stand behind and
be passionate about I can imagine it's
probably also kind of getting people
some kind of inspire them to ultimately
donate yeah absolutely
ultimate objective from the marketing
point of view yes very cool and would
you say in in the marketing that you do
is there a lot of digital marketing that
comes into play as well are there
particular channels that you feel work
really well for you in the digital space
definitely I think one thing that our
organization specifically is going
through is really trying to figure out
how we can utilize digital marketing
more so we kind of actually just went
through our back-to-school campaign and
we really tried to do the analytics
behind what is the benefit in the sense
of still using mail out back-to-school
campaigns versus just going straight
digital marketing and so one thing that
we learned going through this is that
you know we would prefer to just go
digital marketing moving forward the
results in the return rate was would be
higher through digital marketing and
then it would be through a print
campaign and so that's a lot of things
that you'll kind of see through
nonprofits across the board are really
trying to find that meeting
and so it's a matter of transitioning
from a print and a mail-outs campaign to
a strictly digital marketing campaign
and when you think about digital
marketing for you like what are the the
different types of channels you've used
is it kind of social primarily we use a
lot we definitely use a lot we do email
it's definitely one of our primaries we
do we also use our social media and then
we use our website of course and one of
the reasons why we use so a broad range
of all of them is because our community
that were you know our donor database
when you're looking at it is a wide
range also you know we definitely are
aiming towards the Millennials using the
social media platform in that case but a
lot of our older donors that have been
contributed to the organization for over
you know many years theirs would be
probably more a male or an email type
thing
and so we're looking at it from that
standpoint and moving in that general
into that direction of being able to
segment out which which which outlets
are the ones that you want to use for
your demographic for the different
targets yeah because we teach it our
course we teach our students about its
kind of the different target populations
the different personas they can go after
and indeed these personas interact
differently with digital media so you
want to adjust a little break that so
when you think about kind of your
business objective and how you translate
that to the marketing objective and then
from there get into a campaign can you
walk us a little bit through the flow of
how that goes into your organization
sure so right now we're going through
our givingtuesday campaign givingtuesday
is aimed directly to donating the day
after cyber monday so you've just gone
through Black Friday you've just gone
through Cyber Monday and we've just been
inundated with constant shopping and so
we've so there's this givingtuesday
campaign that is all about giving giving
for the holiday season so we've just
spent you know these couple days
spending a lot of money on Christmas
gifts and all this other stuff but what
about giving sorry givingtuesday
campaign starts off through the
givingtuesday organization and so a lot
of our campaigns are actually correlated
with other corporations and so we're
able to combine them and so when we go
ahead and do that we're going through
like an entire
toolkit set up and so in that toolkit
there is the social media the social
media posts that are already done you
have a lot of the logos that are already
incorporated and the things that you
just kind of have to like bold to your
cause and so the greatest thing about
all of that is that while it's already
done for you it's still the work behind
finding the story the compelling story
that you're going to use for that
holiday season from the business
standpoint it's a matter of also looking
at what is your target what are you
trying to gain from it in that sense and
so there's a lot of different avenues
that go into that campaign but it's
definitely a lot of prep on the front
end so our givingtuesday campaign will
launch on the Tuesday so we're only
accepting I don't want to say only
accepting donations but the goal is that
people are going to their computers to
donate on givingtuesday the same way
they're going to their computers to shop
on Cyber Monday and so you're kind of
prepping this whole entire campaign over
these next couple weeks to get it aimed
for that giving Tuesday day to have
particular days
yeah and that's something that you
repeat every year every year yes yeah we
did and that also means that you have to
find a story to tell every year yes yeah
and how do you go about confining that
inspiring story
so the nice thing about our organization
is that we're all very involved with in
our clubhouses
so like I said our organization is kind
of like it's like a franchise and so
within our own little French as we have
these twelve club houses that be that
are ours and so with that having 3000
youth we all it's 12 club houses and so
we're all very close and so we can I can
call a unit director at a club house and
say like hey I really want to use one of
your members at your Clubhouse what's
one of the compelling stories so there's
always somebody that knows a story of a
youth that we're able to use and and be
able to tell the story of the
organization through that yeah very cool
very cool and I think we have an example
of this campaign that we can show yes
they're getting sued a campaign maybe we
should take a look at that yeah
can we show it or it's really it's
snowing right now so and that's an
example of like our email campaign that
we would send out and so we send out a
few of those before the actual date and
then we send one on the day of also very
good yeah that's also that's one of the
other things that we talk about in the
class and then yes it's actually a whole
you want to get that customer to that
journey and writing them to ultimately
take action when it takes a few steps
typically yes it's like setting an alarm
on your phone like you usually have to
set multiple alarms to like that I'm at
the end of that morning but then you're
doing the same thing with the campaign
if you kind of just want to set those
little alarms throughout and so they say
when the givingtuesday day comes up
they're ready to go
very cool so now I bet that when you go
through kind of as a marketer you run
many campaign and not every campaign is
always successful so I'm sure that
you've also faced some challenges at
times right there must be things that
maybe don't go as well you look back on
the other guy yes are there some of
those exact definitely when I was
interning with the organization one of I
had this great idea of doing a 25 by 25
campaign and I wanted to raise $25,000
over 25 days but I wanted there to be 25
reasons why you should donate and while
it was an all-around really great
campaign idea the prep to it was just it
was very we decided to do it very last
minute and so we had kind of a mixture
of like there was this pressure of we
have these 25 days we have these 25
reasons we need to get these $25,000 and
it was really hard to do this last
minute when there was so much prep time
that needed to be done beforehand and so
it was kind of a like on November 1st we
were like we want to raise $25,000 in 25
days without giving our our donors a
heads up of like this is what we're
anticipating for and this is what you
should be ready for so I think looking
back at it if I were to do it again it
would definitely be a preparing for it
beforehand and making sure that the
goals behind it and the strategies
behind it are all aligned because it was
kind of a like that running with the
running with the dream and with this
idea and like not having any real
strategy behind it and so I definitely
would say when you know coming up with
campaigns or when doing campaigns is
making sure that your strat
and your goals all aligned with the
outcome that you want from it yeah and
that you prepped for it right definitely
and you got for it as well so how long
would you say how long do you typically
prep for it can't be like the
givingtuesday campaign giving you get
started giving Tuesday it comes begins
to start to form in July and so it's
it's a it's and it's kind of July is
like prepping and making sure that
everything is set in plays and you kind
of want to get started and you're
registered and you're your donor your
donation page is up and going and then
you start to really advertise it come
like end of September early October so
it takes a lot of on the front end
making sure that everything is just a
line but then September October is that
timeframe where you want to start doing
that and that's where you just start to
get to message child give me a little
kind of aware right and then really in
November I spent a big it's wonder day
yes is when the big Tuesday hits and use
that so but there are some campaigns we
have like back-to-school campaigns
beginning of summer campaigns some of
them like for example the Ross campaign
which you can see on there right now too
is like a lot of those happen in the bat
and the back-to-school timeframe and so
those are usually campaigns where stores
will partner with us and they'll do like
a 20% back to Boys and Girls Clubs of
Silicon Valley for when you come
shopping so then it's kind of that
benefit of like oh well you know this
family is gonna go school shopping
anyway they might as well go to Ross and
then whatever they're spending on so
those are kind of those easier campaigns
where you don't have to prep as much in
advance because really those are just
kind of ones that you can just drop here
Wow so I bet as a nonprofit typically
you manage several priorities right yeah
it's kind of different focuses now how
do you manage imbalance all that two
different priorities that you have as a
marketer so with nonprofit a lot of the
time as you'll see in a lot of
nonprofits that there isn't usually
somebody who is running their marketing
and that's kind of just when you look at
nonprofit it's hard because the
bandwidth and budgets and things like
that are very are a lot smaller so you
usually see some some nonprofits have
their Resource Development Director is
their marketing manager and they're
special events planner and everything
and so wearing a lot of hats but then
still having to like time manage a lot
of it and sometimes you have to put
things on the back burner and that's
where it kind of begins to get kind of
hard and
so I think one thing like with nonprofit
and I'm not saying this is all of them
across the board but a good percentage
from what you know when talking about it
is is that that bandwidth behind that
and that sometimes you are wearing
multiple hats and you have to kind of
figure out when did to put on one hand
and want to take off it want to take it
off and put on another but I think one
thing that we've been really fortunate
with as far as Boys and Girls Club is
that since we are a national brand still
Boys and Girls Clubs of America also
supports us a lot in the sense of having
tools ready for us to use so we don't
always have to start from scratch
completely there's webinars that they
provide for us and so a lot of the
nonprofits that have an umbrella around
them so YMCA YWCA Boys and Girls Clubs
Big Brothers Big Sisters they have an
overall branding message that kind of
helps with a lot of that and it's it's a
huge lifesaver it really is so I
wouldn't have to wear a lot of miles
yeah that's yes yeah so in many years so
when you get your message out so a large
part of your marketing is towards donors
and getting the nation's how do you
reach the actual population that like
the kids that may ultimately be your
your your kids inside the Boys and Girls
Club do you do marketing towards them as
well or so we're kind of so with Boys
and Girls Clubs lucuma we're actually at
capacity so we're we're in a space right
now where we're actually looking more at
expanding so that we can get more kids
off the waitlist right now we have a lot
of kids on the waitlist and so our
branding a lot of our messaging is more
about getting more kids off that
waitlist and getting them more into our
facilities and into our into our
organization and so that we can make a
greater impact nice and so right now so
as much as I would love to have that
issue where we're we need more kids in
the building it's actually the opposite
so which is also really great this
should have in the sense of you know
we're we're doing a great job with 12
houses and under 3000 youth of you have
more kids in the buildings into
buildings and so but for us it's more
about donors volunteers people who are
just wanting to make an impact in any
way that they are able to do yeah yeah
and what you see is they're also do you
also use some
kind of free social media at all on the
donor side like anything in terms of
messages or blog posts that you put out
there or yeah so we definitely use a lot
of our social media so Facebook Twitter
Linkedin that's also something that
we've noticed a lot too is when using it
there are some donors that they won't
touch Facebook and they won't touch
Twitter but they're all over LinkedIn
and so kind of trying to figure out that
demographic of where are a lot of these
avenues where do we use a lot of our
demographic and where are we trying to
target in certain areas so a lot of the
donor Millennials are more on the social
media and a lot of our more professional
careers are already set they're you know
good to go those are more on our
LinkedIn our board members are more on
LinkedIn and so having to find out
having to find that in social media is
definitely one of the things that should
be focused on yeah yeah I bet I bet yeah
and if you think about it if your
day-to-day operations like are there
particular parts of it that you enjoy
more that all the things are yeah there
definitely is social media is always a
really fun one it's more time consuming
than I think people really realize to do
a posts for the entire week can take
anywhere like from three hours to six
hours and just making sure all those are
set just because the analytics within a
lot of the social media there's you know
Twitter you should be posting three
times a day
Facebook is only once or twice a week
type thing so knowing those always helps
the other one is just designing and then
being able to tell the kids stories is
always my favorite figuring out a way to
kind of just put that into a phase where
every time that my my vision is that
every time I hand you anything that has
a kid story is that it touches your
heart and that it's to the point where
it's a like it's gonna make you cry like
that's what I want that's always my goal
and so being able to tell those stories
and form those and create those
campaigns that are in that realm that's
always my favorite very cool yeah so and
then well at Udacity of course we're
very into lifelong learning we think
that's important do you have a way to
build that in into your own career as
well do you have a chance to focus on
that and are there certain tactics that
you use yeah
I'm actually really fortunate because my
CEO and my CDO both very much believed
and continued learning after that so
anytime that there's a webinar or a
conference that they feel you know might
help me and more ideas or you know kind
of just planting a seed they're always
encouraging and making sure that they
can but they can support me and learning
more so and it's always about having a
mentor I'm always a big believer and you
should always have a mentor in any
career that you have to kind of help you
to continue learning same thing with
like you know having the right books
right now I'm reading visibility
marketing and so always just that
continued learning and being open that
you don't know everything about
marketing especially in digital
marketing and knowing that like because
technology is advancing digital
marketing is gonna be advancing just
that much faster yeah yeah and how did
you for yourself did you find a mentor
that you feel can help I did just
recently actually I'm really excited she
just joined our advisory board and she's
been one that's been connecting me
everywhere and introducing me to people
that will you know help me further my
career and everything and so I'm really
excited
so that Sandra Miley is I'm really
excited about working more with her and
with the organization that's very cool
yeah because I would agree that find
endorsement yassir's is really helpful
for further advancing in your career in
learning and then opening your worlds to
new things right and yeah I think many
of our students are hoping to find those
types of mentors in their careers as
well definitely would you have any any
advice for our students in general kind
of getting into digital marketing many
of the students are just hoping to get
into their first jobs in digital
marketing would you have advice for them
as to how to tackle that I think one
thing when I look back at when I was
doing PR and marketing is that I never
thought I'd actually be doing marketing
and for a nonprofit I always thought
that I would be going corporate and
everything and now it's very much the
opposite I feel like I would never go
corporate and I'd only go nonprofit and
I really think that's because I found a
cause that I love doing marketing for
and so my advice is that you find
something that you are absolutely
passionate about it could be a cell
phone it could be a nonprofit it could
be anything but find something that you
can truly stand behind and love doing
marketing for that and that would be my
biggest advice and
very cool well I got in the meantime
while we were all listening we also got
like another student question in and
that's actually from Tala
Iwan who asked what works better for a
non-profit is it social media or paid
ads like AdWords for instance do you
have like a sense of whether one or the
other works better or they work better
together so we haven't explored with AD
with paid AdWords yeah it's something
that we're gonna be working towards in
the next couple months
um and so we're really excited to be
using that that's something that I've
been looking more into but we do do with
a lot of social media post we've done
the Boost posts also and so those have
been working really well I think we're
also in a space where like you know we
just came out with our video we just
finished our gala so we have a lot of
really great momentum coming right now
and so and it's just a matter of staying
on top of that so I wouldn't I can't say
which one I would think is better but
social media has worked in our favor
yeah yeah hi Betty yeah and I guess that
there's many many of the channels that
could work together ultimately to help
you towards your cause very cool now do
you have any other kind of parting words
for our students or any other things
that you feel like we could have touched
on in our interview we didn't know
everything sounds like you have a
marketing role in something that you're
really passionate about which I would
agree like whether you find that in a
non-profit or you find that product that
you like or as long as you can be
passionate about right you market in
what you advertise it really makes for
it makes for a more pleasant experience
telling the story yes and finding ways
to get that message out and it sounds
like some of the stories that you can
find are actually stories that are
absolutely worth getting out and your
organization has definitely I've seen
the organization around here and active
around here and I think that the
organization's definitely succeeded and
I think making the life of many kids a
lot better in giving them a future that
they would otherwise not have fantastic
thank you so yeah but thank you so much
for joining us and thank you for giving
this advice to our students I think they
love hearing from marketers in the
fields and I'm very glad we got to talk
to you thank you for having me
