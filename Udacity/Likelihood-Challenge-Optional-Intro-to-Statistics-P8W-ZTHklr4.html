more challenging programming assignment
imagine we have a die that has an
arbitrary number of sides and each side
can be labeled anything we want and the
die can be fair or it can be loaded I
call that here dist you can think of it
as a distribution of values or more
formally a probability distribution but
that doesn't really matter for this
exercise some lecture we learned about
likelihood in the context of coins here
I'd like to ask you about in the context
of a die that can have any number of
sides labeled anything with any
probability and I'd like you to write a
function called likelihood that takes
the data and the distribution and
returns the likelihood I wrote one let's
see what it produces and you can see we
get a very very small number that's
actually quite common with likelihoods
because there are so many different data
values any given one likely has a pretty
small value that said they can still be
interesting now let's look at the code
you're going to have to write and here
is the function likelihood where that
takes a distribution and data just as we
saw below insert your code here have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
