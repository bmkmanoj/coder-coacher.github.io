the six years since then there has been
11 new major platform releases on the
Android developer site we show the
relative number of active Android
devices running a given platform version
in this pie chart because pie charts are
awesome for our purposes though you're
really better off looking at this as a
histogram if you squint you can almost
see a vaguely bell-shaped curve with the
oddest releases here at the left their
popularity dropping off as devices are
upgraded or replaced the largest
proportion of devices are here in the
middle representing devices about two
years old and the newest platforms
gaining popularity as new phones are
released or upgrades go out and here on
the right so with that in mind the min
SDK acts as your low-pass filter Google
Play won't show your app on devices
running a platform version lower than
its minimum SDK version so why not just
set them in SDK to 1 and support
everyone generally you'll want to target
as many users as you can but there's a
cost associated with supporting some of
these older versions things like
creating different execution paths
around deprecated or update API s or
presenting a different UX to devices
with different features so you need to
balance the opportunity of expanding
your audience with the cost of
supporting those new users also remember
that each release introduced with it new
API is and hardware support so it may
not make sense to make your app
available to devices that don't support
your minimum feature set by comparison
the target SDK is not a high-pass filter
it's used only to declare which platform
version you've tested on an app targeted
to a certain API will continue to be
forward compatible on future releases
the platform uses the target SDK values
in case of future platform makes a
significant change to expected behavior
this ensures your app doesn't break when
a user's phone gets upgraded if you're
developing a new app there's really no
reason to target anything but the latest
Android version and once your app has
been released make it a point to update
your target SDK and test as soon as
possible when your platform releases
roll out so you can take advantage of
every new platform optimization and
improvement it has to offer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
