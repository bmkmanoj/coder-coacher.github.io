capabilities move into each I OS device
Apple uses a technology called data
protection to further protect data
stored in fashion memory on a device
data protection allows the device to
respond to common events such as
incoming phone calls but also enables a
high level of encryption for user data
critical system apps such as messages
mail calendar contacts photos and health
data values use data protection by
default and third-party apps install on
iOS 7 or later received this protection
automatically data protection is
implemented by constructing and managing
a hierarchy of keys imbues on the
hardware encryption technologies built
into each I OS device data protection is
controlled on a profile basis by
assigning each file a class and access
to the file is determined by whether the
class keys have been unlocked each time
a file is created later protection
creates a new 256-bit profile key and
gives it to the hardware IES engine
which uses the key to encrypt the file
as it is written to flash memory and the
encryption is done through AES CBC mode
the profile key is wrapped or encrypted
with one or several cars keys and the
rebbe profile key is stored in the files
metadata that is the foul key is used to
encrypt the file contents and the key
itself is encrypted using a class key
and the encrypted or wrapped key is
stored in the files metadata the file
metadata itself is encrypted using a
filesystem key then when a file is
opened or accessed its metadata is
decrypted using the filesystem key this
will reveal the rebbe the profile key
then the profile key is unwrapped with
the cast key the profile key then can be
used to decrypt the file as it is read
from the flash memory the metadata of
all files in the file system is
encrypted using the same random key we
call it the filesystem key
this key is created when iOS is first
installed or when the device is wiped by
the user the class key is protected with
the hardware UID and for some classes
with the users passcode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
