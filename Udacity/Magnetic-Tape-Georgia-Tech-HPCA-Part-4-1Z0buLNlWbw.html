which is usually used for backup
purposes or so-called secondary storage
which means that the magnetic tape is
not the first device on which you look
for your data you first try to find your
data on the hard drive and only if it's
not there you go to secondary storage
either because the hard drive was lost
and you need to restore a backup or
because this data was not used for a
long long time so it was stored on tapes
and put away somewhere tapes can have
large capacity and are usually
replaceable meaning you just bring a
reel of tape and you attach to the tape
machine but their access is
fundamentally sequential we need to seek
along the tape until we find the point
we are interested in so tapes are very
good for things like backup restoring
backups and so on when you're writing
things sequentially for a long time or
reading them sequentially for a long
time but tapes are not very good for
example as a virtual memory or something
like that
tapes are slowly dying out mainly
because they have a low production
volume because not many people actually
use tape so the cost of tapes is not
dropping as rapidly as the cost of disks
which have much more mass production so
their cost gets cheaper over time and at
this point it's cheaper to buy an entire
hard drive together with all the motors
and the head assembly and a built-in
electronics for it then to buy some tape
and the machine that will read it so
people for example use USB drives which
is pretty much an entire hard disk just
packaged with the USB interface as a
method of backup storage and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
