on encryption there are two families of
encryption systems one is the private
key cryptosystem and in the private key
cryptosystem both the sender and the
receiver use symmetric keys for
encryption of the data and decryption of
the data a common private key system
that we all are using probably on an
everyday basis as passwords when we log
into either a corporate network or
university network we use a username and
password and that is using a private key
encryption system the idea is simple the
sender takes the data that they want to
send to a receiver encrypts the data
using a key and this key is a private
key that is known only to the sender and
the receiver and nobody else so by
encrypting the data with this key they
produce what is called a cipher text and
the ciphertext can go on insecure links
anybody can see the bit pattern of the
cipher text but in order to make sense
out of the ciphertext they have to
decrypt it and to decrypt it they need
the key and the key is only available
between the sender and the receiver so
this is where Salters principle comes
into play that is published the design
but protect the key the keys are
protected between the sender and the
receiver you're publishing the method by
which you are transferring information
between sender and receiver namely using
a private key encryption system but for
any bad guy to access information that
is flowing on the wire they have to have
the key in order to make sense out of
the data that is flowing and you make
breaking the key hard enough
computationally that the system is
secure now one of the problems with the
private key system is the fact that the
keys have to be distributed to the
sender and the receiver and key
distribution problem is one of the
with private key cryptosystems
especially as the size of the
organization becomes larger and larger
the public key cryptosystem overcomes
the ski distribution problem and in this
case there is a public key that is
published the name itself suggests the
idea behind the public key cryptosystem
and that is anyone can create an
encrypted data by taking this public key
which is available let's say published
in the yellow pages they can take the
public key take the data that they want
to send encrypt it and send it on the
wire but in order to decrypt that data
the public key is no good you need a
private key that is the only way to
decrypt this data but in other words the
mathematical underpinning of the public
key cryptosystem is that there are
asymmetric keys a pair of keys for
information exchange in order to encrypt
you use a key that is a public key
anybody can have access to that but in
order to decrypt that you need a private
key and conversion of data into a cipher
text using the public key is a one-way
function which is not reversible
similarly converting the encrypted
message into the original data using the
private key is another one wave function
so one wave functions are the
mathematical basis for the public key
cryptosystem so now the way you would
send data if you are the sender take the
data encrypt it using the public key you
create a ciphertext once you have the
ciphertext you cannot convert it back to
the data using the public key the only
entity that can convert the ciphertext
back to its original data is the entity
that has the private key the other part
of this asymmetric key infrastructure
namely the private key and using the
private key you can decrypt the
ciphertext and create
the original data so this is the
workflow for a sender to encrypt the
data create a ciphertext send it to the
receiver receiver decrypt set using the
private key and produces the original
data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
