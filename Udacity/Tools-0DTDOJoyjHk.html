we forget the variable name that we
defined earlier and we just had to trace
back and use the council as a clue for
us to go back and see what's figure out
what's going on and to avoid problems
like these two it's a double to have a
text editor that works with you so
sublime text for instance comes with tab
completion by default and that tab
completion will use variable names that
you've used are ready to sort of help
you out so except definitely am using
all the tools at their disposal is is
very very helpful yeah it's the exact so
i'll show you my completion some add in
bio Bylsma hajek I hit a dot and here
you go and biopic I hit tab and then
done so it's it's very useful and it's
worth the time and effort to learn a
good text editor it could be any text
editor but just make sure that the this
text editor has these capabilities that
will allow programmers and developers to
UM quickly and efficiently program such
like sub such as sublime text Adam what
else what our tech centers do you
recommend i use em so if you're willing
to learn them it's a bit of a steep
learning curve but rewarding is we're
working and also if you're or if you're
old-school you could use another type of
a text ahead Oracle Emacs yep alright so
there's there's a lot of great and free
text editors out there I just recommend
just pick one and stick with it and
learn how to use the tools that these
editors uh come with yeah because as a
partner you're going to be spending
hours hours of your day every day using
it so it helps to actually like the
program that you're using
you can use the w3 org validator for CSS
but something really cool that we here
at Udacity found was the CSS lint dotnet
which is very cool in detecting errors
and so so this is how the website look
CSS link dotnet and this is where you
piss your cold CSS code here and so you
can pick and choose which errors and
warnings you want to test for below so I
would say you can pick everything that
is therein argued a city style guide
rules and you can sort of see if they
match with one of these errors and
enable only those errors and sort of run
your code through it so i have a very
base example of CSS code right here that
i'm just going to run it through so i'm
i'm just enabled all the errors here
just to look at um how I've been coding
and what are the best practices and what
all it catches what errors it catches so
I'm just going to go ahead and run the
linter um so it says CSS lint found one
errors and zero warnings um so let's see
what this is it says there is a parsing
error expected RV race of line three
column eight um so it's pointing me to
wait here mm-hmm so it looks like you're
missing a semicolon at the end of the
flawed family rule oh my god yes I am
indeed missing that okay um so let's go
back and change add a semicolon here
yeah these ours can be very frustrating
I never asked them okay so now it says
CSS lint on your errors and zero warning
so yeah here looks like Mike Otis Greene
now and I also checked it through CSS
Linda met when you have a huge block of
JSON data just sitting inside one file
and you're parsing that data to display
it render if you notice to all the
phasers on
it can happen that yeah it might have a
lot of barriers in it or you might be
missing a coma or curly braces and
incurring grace which always happens to
me um we didn't actually have something
called JSON with um ji sunderland ultima
validate or JSON well i'm going to share
my screen video um and take you to json
live.com okay um and so here on Jason
Furman com you can see that I've pasted
a very small JSON data which is
basically my bio object um which you
will be working on in your biz you need
to create various objects for plyometric
education I can come back to the engine
I'm sort of your finger where you're
from the topic but yes um so I have this
JSON data pasted in type of the adjacent
validator not going to get quality and i
see that i have an error here under
missile test parse error on line 1 VAR x
0 equal this um I think we have to
separate the variable from mid an object
name which is clearly waters gone wrong
um so I'm going to give just a stage
right here and then pick solid eight I
hope you don't define object names
inside floor which is all alligator um
so why don't you just give the JSON data
without reminding you to an object okay
and then it's not have just found
addicted yeah I think that's what I was
doing wrong here um so JSON objects do
not don't put in the object CJ in their
object yeah we can try that without even
trying fire yeah it's in your still
giving showing up in her the dusty
option no fair no name oh yeah yeah I
mean not only this blog is
it's about with JSON file the shape my
nesting it is perfect since I have my
name I have my role my contacts has
three on separate attributes as well the
mobile email communication so i enclose
it to pick up curly braces and then my
skills are n re so i can find it as an
area that's why i have the square pieces
they're awesome they're definitely
didn't hi Gary okay so this is jay song
live com whenever you find yourself on
getting stuff being able to access JSON
data just ensure that you know the
structure is valid for you step data
inside functions to bend it so just like
usually I member items moms in a bit to
make sure I got a date definitely yeah
yeah um if you can get crazy when you
have a large amount of data seem just
like 12 font files with changing the
data so it helps to validate bills</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
