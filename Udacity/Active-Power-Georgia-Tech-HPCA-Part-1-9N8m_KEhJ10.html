active power can be computed as one half
of the total capacitance of the circuit
where the capacitance can be seen as
roughly proportional to chip area so
larger ships will have more of this the
next factor is voltage square this is
the power supply voltage the higher the
power supply voltage the higher the
power is and this relationship is
quadratic so doubling of the power
supply voltage will actually quadruple
the power the next factor is clock
frequency this is the gigahertz number
that you normally see on a processor
specification and finally the Alpha is
the activity factor without this alpha
we are assuming that the processor is
constantly switching every clock cycle
all of its transistors so alpha really
says that for example only 10% of the
processors transistors are actually
active in any given clock cycle now
let's see what happens to power if after
two years we reduce the size of the
processor to one-half of what it was
because of technology improvement the
new capacitance is half of what it was
for one processor however because we
want to build a more powerful processor
we put two of them on a chip so the
scene you really is equal to see old
let's say that the voltage and the
frequency stayed the same and let's say
that it's still the same processor
design so the same percentage of
transistors are active that means really
that the active power is relatively
unchanged if we do this what we have is
effectively a processor that consumes
the same amount of power but it does
have twice the number of cores that it
had before so it's actually twice as
capable computationally because each of
those cores is still operating at the
same frequency as before and it's really
very similar to the old core in reality
smaller transistors are gonna be faster
so we can increase the clock frequency
of the processor too so let's say that
the new clock frequency is 25% higher
than the old one that increases the
power consumed so it's now twice as fast
because of the number of cores another
25% improvement because of this but the
overall power consumption is now higher
smaller transistors however may let us
lower the power supply voltage while
maintaining the same speed so let's say
that the new power supply voltage is
equal to 0.8 of the old power supply
voltage that allows us to have a
significantly lower power consumption
because of this square relationship so
0.8 squared is 0.64 if we put these two
together we can get something like the
voltage we don't lower it as much
because if we did then we couldn't also
increase the frequency so we lower it
only a little bit the frequency we
cannot increase it as much because if we
did we would have to keep the same power
supply voltage as before so let's say we
only increase the frequency by a factor
of 1.1 if you now apply this equation we
get that the new power is about 90
percent of the old power so what we got
is now we have a chip that is having two
cores instead of one it has a lower
power supply voltage but a higher
frequency so each of this course is ten
percent faster than the one used to be
and yet we have lower power consumption
this is why it's so important for active
power to have the technology improvement
reduce the size of transistors and we
also have to realize that in order to
get power improvements we really really
really need to lower the voltage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
