more than a dozen classes that all have
had plenty of security issues so this is
the correct answer one may wonder why is
it that issues end up in a small number
of places and that such large parts of
the code remain without any issues well
for JavaScript this is pretty clear this
piece holds the JavaScript interpreter
which interacts through many many
interfaces with the system and all of
these are possible attack vectors so
it's no surprise that JavaScript holds
these many security issues plus an
interpreter is notoriously hard to get
right HTML loud may come as a surprise
after all this is just the rearranging
of appropriate user interface elements
on the screen why would there be
security issues related to that the
reason is cross-site scripting as soon
as you lay out multiple sources on one
page it may be that one source tries to
access elements of the other source
using your screen as a tunnel and these
issues are right here with an HTML
layout the document object model also
allows accessing and manipulating
individual elements this again is an
open door for security issues as well as
for content bays I don't really know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
