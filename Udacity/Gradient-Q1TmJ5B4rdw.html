shift tracking you remember before when
I was showing you the mean shift example
we were popping down a circle right and
I said we'll worry later about the shape
of that well that circle can be thought
of as a uniform colonel what i mean by
uniform is that its height is the same
everywhere around it happens to have a
circular shape and it would be written
like that that's not such a great
Colonel what do you think a better
Colonel might be well instead of using
uniform Colonel we could use something
that is differentiable we'll use that in
a minute isotropic all that means is
that it's the same in every direction
monotonically decreasing Colonel and
there's a certain convexity proper
you're not going to worry about that so
so what's our favorite differentiable
isotropic monotonically decreasing
always positive colonel yes it's the
Gaussian okay so here it's written just
as a constant proportional to fall off
by the square of the distance okay you
can also have a scale factor right so if
you wanted you could talk about like the
Sigma sort of the the scale of the
colonel what's really cool about this is
that unlike the uniform kernel which
goes straight in the falls off on the
edge this is differentiable okay you can
know how much it's changing and it also
means that it goes down to zero at the
edges so as you slide that Colonel along
a new point it just has a very very
small weight in fact an infant teslim is
small weight and then it grows likewise
points that are right near the top their
weight doesn't change very much right
because as you slide it along the weight
stays about the same the points that are
going to have the greatest value or the
ones that are along the slope what that
means is you can know how your function
changes as you move that is your overall
function so you're about a char
coefficient for example and what you can
do is you can use this gradient to
essentially hill climb up your
similarity function right so you can by
computing this you don't have to sort of
blindly search you can actually follow
that gradient and get to a local maximum
alright and that was the basis of mean
shift tracking so now going back to our
previous example here of the ping pong
right we start with the the current
frame we want to search but now our
search can actually climb to the maximum
of this function using that gradient
information and that's mean shift
tracking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
