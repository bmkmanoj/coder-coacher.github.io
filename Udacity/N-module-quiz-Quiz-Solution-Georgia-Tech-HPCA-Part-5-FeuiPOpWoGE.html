module redundancy quiz where we had
three computers that are total identical
on the same desk and we use them as a
three module redundant system and the
question is what type of event can we
always overcome a single of a particle
strike is going to affect only a single
processor and that means that the two
computers that are not affected by this
will still agree a building collapse
will either be another building and not
affect anything but if it is the
building in which these systems are then
the building collapse is probably going
to destroy all three computers so we
cannot tolerate this type of event
earthquake is going to do a similar
thing and a mistake in processor design
because the three are identical if there
is a mistake in processor design it's
going to affect all three processors at
the same time so again we cannot
tolerate this so as you can see
replicating the hardware with identical
hardware and in an identical location
only really ensures that we can survive
something like a particle strike if we
wanted to tolerate earthquakes and
building collapses we would need to
geographically distribute these three
computers if we want to tolerate a
mistake in processor design we would
need to use three computers with
different processors so the end module
redundancy doesn't really guard against
these types of faults unless the modules
are in different places and of different
designs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
