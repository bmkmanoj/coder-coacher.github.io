those diagrams that have to do with the
behavior the dynamic aspects of the
system rather than the static ones the
first behavioral diagram I want to
discuss is a very fundamental one the
use case diagram so let's start by
seeing what a use case is a use case
represents two main things first the
sequence of interactions of outside
entities which is what we normally call
actors with the system that we're
modeling and the second thing is the
system actions that yield an observable
result of values to the actors basically
these two things are nothing else that
the outside view of the system so the
view of the system in which we look at
the interaction between the system and
the outside world if you want a parallel
think about designing a house by
considering how you will use the house
and you might have seen use cases called
with different names so for example
they're also called scenarios scripts or
user stories but in the context of UML
we'll call them use cases now let's look
at the basic notation for a use case
which is fairly simple we have a use
case
which is represented by a novel with the
name which is the name of the use case
with an actor which is represented by
this icon and is normally identified by
a roll name and finally we have an edge
which is a solid line that connects
actors and use cases and indicates that
an actor is the actor of a given use
case and just for completeness let me
note that there are some additional
notational elements but for now for
simplicity we'll just use this ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
