well first it enables consolidation and
consolidation is this ability to run
multiple virtual machines with their
operating systems and applications on a
single physical platform consolidation
then leads to improved cost efficiency
with fewer machines with less space
potentially with fewer admins and with
fewer electrical bills we'll be able to
run the same kind of workload so
consolidation delivers benefits because
it allows us to decrease cost and also
to improve the Mensch ability of the
system in addition with virtualization
once the operating system in its
applications are nicely encapsulated in
a VM and decoupled from the actual
physical Hardware it becomes more easy
to migrate the OS and the applications
from one physical machine to another
physical machine or even to copy and
clone them on to multiple physical
machines at the same time as a result
virtualization leads to mechanisms that
are useful in order to provide greater
availability of the services like for
instance if we have an increase in the
load we can just create multiple VMs and
address that issue so increase the
availability of the system and also to
provide solutions that improve the
reliability for instance if we the tag
that a particular hardware node is
getting caught and likely will fail we
can just migrate those VMs on to some
other physical loans there are other
benefits to virtualization for instance
because the OS and the applications are
nicely encapsulated in a virtual machine
it becomes more easy to contain any
kinds of bugs or any kinds of malicious
behavior to those resources that are
available to the virtual machine only
and not to potentially affect the entire
hardware system speaking of the bugging
in particular virtualization has
delivered some other benefits that it
has become a very important platform for
operating systems research it LED
systems researchers quickly introduced
new operating system feature and has
them in the always that's encapsulated
in a VM and then they have ability to
more quickly view the effects of that
and debug it as opposed to a more
traditional cycle which would have
included Hardware restarts of the
machines and then searches through the
log files of the error files etc
virtualization is also useful because it
provides affordable support for legacy
operating systems with virtualization
it's no longer necessary to designate
some hardware resources for some older
operating system just because it's
needed to run one particular application
for instance instead that legacy OS and
applications can be packaged in a
virtual machine and then can be
co-located consolidated on the same
hardware resources that support other
VMs and other applications and there are
many other benefits to virtualization
these are some of the key ones though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
