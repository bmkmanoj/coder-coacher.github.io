something called total available market
and I like to think of total available
market as a pie it's the entire pie
total available market says look how
many people or companies or whatever
your unit of sale is would want or need
this product and how large is the market
in dollars or units if they all bought
that's just a pretty nice calculation
and the question is okay how would I
find out in different industries there
are analysts that specialize in vertical
markets and enterprise software its
Gartner and Forrester in video games
it's the NPD group and consumer research
it's Nielsen if you want to understand
how many website and mobile startups are
you go to the startup Genome Project etc
so you need to ask some questions is
which industry analysts kind of follow
your specific domain and then also Wall
Street analysts follow competitors in
this business and that is they follow
who's ever public and in fact some of
them write very nice research reports if
you have access to university library or
a friendly broker you could grade it get
a great free industry analyst report and
I would be asking others as well and
Google is your best friend here I truly
would be spending time trying to
understand is this a billion-dollar
market and by the way if you throw out
those numbers the first thing I'm going
to ask you is well that's nice but break
it down for me you know help me
understand how many users who are the
players whether the competitors etc you
need to understand this total available
market pie in some detail before I let
you get to the next step and the next
step is how big is my slice and we tend
to use a fancy word for that is what's
the served available market and the
served available market means okay well
instead of the theory that there are
seven billion people in the world how
many people really can use a you know
mobile app oh well a mobile app is kind
of dependent on how many people have
mobile smartphones and gee if I'm making
the mobile app for let's say an Android
platform then the first question is how
many theoretical people are going to be
using
Android platforms and this year in the
next five oh now I could unstart
estimating what's my served available
market and so how many people have the
money to buy the product that is are you
a $0.99 product or are you a $99 product
now you're narrowing the market based on
pricing or availability and you want to
do some thought experiments like how
large with the market be in dollars if
they all bought if everybody that served
available market bought how how large
would this be and this is kind of your
first test
to say oh or Wow
and so you want to understand this both
for dollars and units and how do you
find out well this is one where you're
really out of the building and talking
to customers and then I think of this
again using the pie analogy the first
step was trying to understand the number
of people in the world but now we can
narrow it down if I have a Android app
to the number of Android phones capable
phones and then down to but well how
many would buy at my price but now we
really want to get pretty specific who
exactly am I going to sell in years 1 2
&amp;amp; 3
how many customers is that how large is
the market if they all bought that is
what we now are coming up with is the
total number of dollars if you had a
hundred percent market share your
revenue isn't going to exceed this
number and how many units would that be
again how do I find out boy this is
really about getting out of the building
and talking to customers and talking to
potential channel partners and talking
to competitors etc you're really at the
end of this exercise now have a first
pass hypothesis about is this business
model canvas worth executing for the
next couple of years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
