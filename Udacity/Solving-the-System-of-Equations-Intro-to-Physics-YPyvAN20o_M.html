you are an ace at solving these sorts of
systems of equations you can skip this
part but for those who aren't I'm gonna
walk you through it so here we have our
two equations I like to write them one
above the other to make things a little
simpler for me now my goal is to
eventually know what the acceleration of
this system is I'm going to do that by
first solving for the tension in one of
these equations and then plugging in and
let me show you what I mean by that so
let's take this equation if I move this
term to this side I find that the
tension is equal to m1a and the a is
still unknown plus m1 G why don't I plug
this in this value of the tension into
here the idea being that now I'll get
this equation in terms of only one
unknown a and F T won't show up anymore
so I rewrite m2 G minus F T but now
using this and that equals m2 a let's
just distribute this minus sign and lose
the parentheses well now I'm solving for
a so let's group all the a terms
together I'm gonna move this a over here
okay so now that we've done that I'm
going to take out the common factors of
each of these terms and each of these
terms so for example each of these terms
has a gene and each of these terms has
an A in it and now we're really close
let's divide both sides by this term
here and here is our answer and this is
truly a thing of beauty and let me
explain why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
