you might have some difference of
opinion here but I wouldn't say that the
bug was in the actual software under
test because the actual software did
what it was supposed to do according to
the specification correctly and the
acceptability was there a bug in us the
acceptability test well in that the
acceptability test didn't check this
then yes but if you're going to use that
as a metric then you could argue that
all bugs are bugs in acceptability tests
because they didn't catch all the bugs
which is of course infeasible I would
say this is a bug in the specification
because this was a miscommunication
between the engineers at NASA and
Lockheed Martin and both of their ideas
were correct but they didn't communicate
those ideas properly it was assumed on
each of their ends so if they had put
that information explicitly in the
specification then we wouldn't really
have had the issues and Mars climate
orbiter wouldn't have had at least that
bug maybe something else would crop up
maybe not I also wouldn't say that there
was a bug in the underlying OS compiler
libraries are hardware or at least this
bug isn't an example of that at least we
don't have any evidence of that there
might have been other bugs again but
this one I would say is definitely a bug
in the specification so let's check one
more example and then move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
