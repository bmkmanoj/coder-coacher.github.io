there something called an if statement
this isn't that different from the way
humans make decisions let me show you
what I mean for example when I go to an
art store I may think if markers are on
sale for a certain amount then I'll buy
a lot of them but when I go outside I
think if it's cold outside then I'll
wear a jacket
these are simple if statements I used to
make decisions all the time I check if
some condition is true like if it's cold
outside and if it is when I perform some
action like wearing a coat in
programming the if statement is used the
same way to test different conditions
and execute code accordingly let's
translate our decision about whether to
wear a coat or not into Java code to
make a decision about wearing a coat we
just need to know if it's cold outside
and if it is we'll wear a coat the Java
code for making a decision about wearing
a coat is an if statement that looks
like this let's look at our
decision-making code first we have an if
that starts our if statement followed by
the information our program needs to
make a decision this will tell us
whether it's cold outside or not and
it's inside these parentheses this
variable value is cold is something
called a test condition because it's
value varies to tell us if it is or
isn't cold and we have to test it to
determine its value and this test
condition has to evaluate to either true
or false and what variable do we know
that does that boolean z' boolean scan
only have the value true or false and
are perfect for decision making so let's
say we have access to this boolean is
cold but we don't know whether it will
be true or false the next thing in our
if statement is a block of code which
can be multiple lines of code and
comments and this code will only execute
if the test condition is cold is true
and this whole block of code is
surrounded by these curly braces and
that completes our if statement notice
that the if statement does not end with
a semicolon
like other lines of code do it begins
and ends with curly braces instead and
that's because a semicolon tells our
code that this is the end of a statement
but an if statement is more like a
container that holds lines of code
inside these braces so let's say the
value of a is called
is true then our test condition will be
true and will enter our if statement
block of code and then our print output
will be it's cold wear a coat but if is
cold is false our test condition won't
be true and we'll skip over this block
of code and nothing will be printed out
next let's see how we can apply our
knowledge about if statements to program
