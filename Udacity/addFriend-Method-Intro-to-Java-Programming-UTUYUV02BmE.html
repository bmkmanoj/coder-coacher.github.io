should look something like this there
might be other ways to do it but I think
this is the simplest one if you didn't
get this it's okay there's more practice
coming up there are some subtlety as to
how this method works so let's go
through an example let's say we have two
variables one for Maria and one for
jamesha each of those should contain a
person object with a name and friends we
have string objects for Maria's name
Maria's current friends jamesha x' name
and jamesha is current friends let's say
we call Maria add friend jamesha we call
this method on the Maria object and we
pass in as an argument the jamesha
object now when this line runs the first
thing that it does is creates a new
string from these ones this will be the
new string that's created it's going to
put together friends friend dot name and
a space friends is the Friends of the
Maria object because that's what we
called the method on so we go to the
Maria object and Friends is currently
just TJ with a space friend name is the
friend the argument which was the
jamesha object dot name which is jamesha
and the space is just a space so when
these strings get put together it'll
look like TJ space jamesha space now the
string created by this part will be
assigned into the friends variable so
the old reference will go away and a new
one will be created and now jamesha
appears in the Friends of Maria the old
friend's string that contained just TJ
might still be around and it hasn't
changed but the Friends variable in the
Maria object now contains a reference to
a different string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
