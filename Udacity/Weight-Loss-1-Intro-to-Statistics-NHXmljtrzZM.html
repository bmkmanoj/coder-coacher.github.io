topics hypothesis testing and the reason
why I love this topic is because this
video about decision making we talked a
lot about data or often called the
sample and the used statistics to
extract information and now if we use
more statistics to make decisions and
the decisions to be binary to be there
yes or no and the reason why I like this
I think life is all about decision
making I think there's no meaning in
doing statistics without eventually at
least making a decision this is the
first time in this class you're gonna
make an actual decision so in this box
appeals for weight loss and in
particular it says that 90% probability
taking these pills a substantial weight
loss is being guaranteed now suppose
your job is not to make a decision
whether to buy this box or not I can
promise you in all likelihood weight
loss pills don't work but whether this
claim is correct or not so you really
care about whether the company that
sells this product made a correct claim
and to do so you talk to people of
taking this medicine and you ask the
question did you lose weight
yes or no and say this is a magical
medication and 11 out of 15 people tell
you yes but four out of 15 people tell
you no obviously this is not ninety
percent in fact what do you think it is
in percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
