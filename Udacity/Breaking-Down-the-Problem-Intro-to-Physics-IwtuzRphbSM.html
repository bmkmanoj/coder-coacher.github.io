block one well the acceleration is going
to be caused by however much bigger this
force is then this force or ft minus m1g
and that's going to equal m1 times a1
now the problem is we can't just go and
solve this for a one not yet anyways
this equation has two unknowns they one
and the tension one equation will never
be able to solve for two unknowns maybe
we can get more information by analyzing
the second block well let's do the
diagram and before we go any further I'm
going to move this equation over here to
emphasize that it belongs with block one
now previously we show the fts de bigger
than m1 g since its accelerating that
way well m2 we know must be accelerating
this way so m2 G must be bigger than ft
now I've glossed over an important point
here is this ft here the same as this ft
here and the answer is yes it is a rope
always maintains the same tension
throughout maybe you can prove it to
yourself by trying to think about what
would happen if somehow the ropes
tension changed what would happen at the
boundary point where the tension changed
that's something you should talk about
in the forums well now the force during
the acceleration is however much bigger
m2 G is over ft and we can write a very
similar equation m2 G minus ft is equal
to the mass times the acceleration net
force equals mass times acceleration and
once again we have two unknowns a2 and
ft well that gives us a total of three
unknowns ft a1 and a2 two equations can
never solve three unknowns but hey I
realize something these blocks are
connected by a string any motion
downwards from this guy has to
correspond to motion upwards from this
guy that means this acceleration has to
be identical to this one we've done
something a little strange here where
we've called acceleration on this side
positive when it's up and on this side
positive when it's down but that's okay
we can do that so now instead of writing
a1 and a2 I can just write hey we're
almost there we're almost has something
very cool because now we only have two
unknowns and two equations can solve two
unknowns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
