successfully made your first Network
request but let's say I want to load a
different image specifically let's say I
want to load an image that uses HTTP
instead of HTTP let's switch the URL and
rerun our project now when we launch the
app we see this error
it says app Transport Security has
blocked clear text HTTP resource load
since it's insecure temporary exceptions
can be configured in your apps info dot
pilas file what's this all about well it
has to do with Apple's new security
feature called app Transport Security or
80s 80s helps their apps be more secure
by forcing them to abide by certain
security standards and as we can see in
this little documentation one such
standard is the recommendation to use
HTTPS exclusively but what's HTTPS well
it's like HTTP but with an added layer
of security we'll talk about it more
later in this course but for now just
know that HTTPS helps ensure that the
data we send back and forth across the
network is more secure so does this mean
that we can't use things that use HTTP
not exactly we can actually enable the
use of HTTP in our apps by changing some
settings in the info dot plist file this
is what was recommended in the debugger
so let's go to the info dot felis file
here at the top
let's click the plus sign and add a new
key value pair start typing app
transport and select app Transport
Security settings this should
automatically default to a dictionary
value and we can add additional settings
to allow HTTP click the arrow to expand
the 80s settings and then click the plus
+ the setting we'll want to use is
called allow arbitrary loads this is a
boolean value and we'll set it to yes
setting this to yes is like saying yes I
want to allow any HTTP requests for my
app now we can actually be more specific
and configure settings that are like
saying I want HTTP requests but only for
a specific domain for instance Udacity
comm and I won't show that now but I'll
post a how-to link in the instructor
notes if you're interested with these
settings changed let's try running our
project
nice there we go our request works and
there's no error there's one more thing
that I want to say about ATS as app
developers we may run into situations
where the data we want to access over
the network only uses HTTP so how do we
follow Apple's guidelines and try to
move to HTTPS is there anything that we
can do well if you find yourself in this
situation it's somewhat out of your
hands the switch from HTTP to HTTPS is
something that the individual or company
running the server where you access the
data is responsible for so I'd recommend
getting in touch with them encouraging
them to upgrade their security standards
if they're unable to upgrade to HTTPS
you may also consider using a different
server or resource altogether whatever
the case the security of data should
always be top priority otherwise users
may not be willing to download your apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
