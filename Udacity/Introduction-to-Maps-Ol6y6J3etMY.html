love them maps on mobile devices like
this one have changed the world over the
last few years it's not that long ago
you had to carry a paper map of any
location you weren't familiar with or
like me as soon as you arrived in an
airport you'd study the route to your
hotel memorizing it so you wouldn't have
to stop in a strange place and unfold a
large piece of paper to figure out where
you were going mobile maps not only
provide a local map in your pocket but
also a map of the entire world down to
street level they also include cool
things such as a view of the street as
if you were there or a 3d fly-around of
many major cities there are so many ways
that Maps can help you build a better
app maybe you have a business and you
want to direct people to that business
why not build an app that provides
navigation to your business from where
they are using location services that
you can learn in one of our modules or
maybe you want to create a treasure hunt
game or plan to geocache you could even
do this virtually where instead of
hiding objects in the real world you put
them in the virtual world with pins on a
map that your users would then have to
find there are far more scenarios than I
can think of and I bet you have a few
doozies of your own in this lesson
you'll learn all about Google Maps and
how you can build them into your Android
apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
