exciting every day you're learning
something new you're doing something new
maybe taking something you knew before
and figuring out a way to spruce it up
and make it exciting so that way you can
get other people enthusiastic about it
the same way you are believe it or not
my favorite part of course of ailment
was all of the tablet work a lot of
people don't like talking to themselves
out loud for hours at a time and I
actually thought it was great because it
allowed me to like formally organize my
thoughts which made me I think better
and one thing I recommend when you
record is actually and we did this and I
think that was a good thing we didn't
start with lesson one I mean lesson one
is the one that you really want to catch
the student you really want to have them
engaged and and you will learn so much
by doing for example lesson five or less
than six and you will take with you that
experience in the creation so you can
actually create a much better less than
one and which is the most important one
for the student to get into the content
so I mean that I like to do in Andy
another course developer did a lot we
would always sort of say you know in
three to six months after students
taking your course what would they say
and I think when you think about it like
that you get a really clear perspective
on sort of like the big picture what you
want to be true so the biggest thing
that I learned while making our audacity
course is how to really keep a big
picture in your mind when you're working
on a small piece now I can think about
how people learn and what they're trying
to look for and what's really effective
as far as you know making sure they have
everything that they need and that kind
of work to really put your students
first and developers versus what's going
to make you more successful in your
course it's easy to get into the habit
of having things fifty percent done
seventy-five percent done when you're
working by yourself on a course but once
you bring in the production lead like
you're working as a team and so you need
to be there one hundred percent because
if you have material that's not ready
yet and it's really difficult for them
to work with you or to be creative and
make things even more interesting
because you still haven't finished your
part it's very good to come into the
studio very well prepared if we had
really committed to getting our code
done early we would have known exactly
like how many steps how many modules how
many lessons there were going to be as
opposed to you know tweaking everything
as we went along and having to kind of
redo some work in particular if you're
doing outdoor scenes
you have lots of things going on are
there going to be many people at that
location is Academy noise will there be
wind I remember one instance there was a
construction where we had a truck moving
back and forth and it has hit me beep
beep signal so we couldn't shoot because
of that it takes definitely a lot of
planning I think planning is probably
the biggest thing that you can do it's
the best thing that you can do to make
sure you have a successful course don't
get overwhelmed like it's it's it's a
lot of work that you're trying to do and
you're trying to work with a lot of
different people with different
perspectives and processes and from
different companies right but like if
you are communicating effectively and if
you know what you want to do and you
hammer it out early on but this can be
fun and it was fun for us we actually
really enjoyed like the whole lead-up to
i/o picture that student now you're
talking to as if you're tutoring them as
if you're helping them so that way it's
not so much focused on you and like the
cameras and the lights that are in front
of you but you actually helping out the
other person that's on the other side of
that camera that's sort of the the fun
playground is thinking about all the
ways you can have someone go through
some sort of experience to gain
understanding and learn new things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
