qualifiers in Lesson one the idea is
that you can vary things like drawable
strings even layouts based on qualifiers
like language and device orientation
there are a number of resource
qualifiers you can use to start changing
your UI based on screen size the primary
ones you should use our width height
landscape orientation and portrait
orientation with in height simply mean
the devices current width or height
which of course changes when you rotate
the device to portrait or landscape
there's also the smallest width
qualifier which is the smaller of the
screens width or height it's the same in
either portrait or landscape so it's a
useful qualifier for controlling
attributes that you don't want to vary
when you rotate the device such as font
sizes there's also small normal large
and extra-large size buckets these are
less useful and because they don't give
you as much control they're considered
deprecated so going back to break points
say we chose a break point of 600 dips
once the screen is wider than 600 devs
we want to tweak our UI for this we add
the W 600 DP directory qualifier to hold
whatever new resources we create another
good resource to use is the design
metrics tool on the Google design
website it lists the screen dimensions
and densities for many popular devices
in android iOS chrome OS and Android
wear along with the UI designer in
Android studio it's a good way to
visualize how your design might need to
change to fill up space on say a nexus 9
in landscape mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
