than in other languages their
capabilities approach those of classes
in addition to their own properties they
can also have their own methods and can
expand functionality through extensions
and protocols let's take a look at a
couple of examples here's a struct
called picture frame it has three stored
properties width height and thickness
and one computed property area as with
enumerations strokes can have customized
in it methods but they also come with
automatically generated member wise
initializers like this one here in this
line of code I'm initializing a 10 by
eight picture frame with a thickness of
1.5 and this is how I access the
computed property area and up here you
can see the area properties custom
getter here's another example this beer
struct has three stored properties style
percent alcohol and an international
Cheers dictionary Cheers dicked is a
type property it also has a computed
property suggested volume per serving
the volume for serving goes down as the
alcohol percentage goes up some of the
Belgian beers at the pub around the
corner from my house are super strong if
I was drinking whole pints of those I
might be in trouble the beer struct also
has its own type method called Cheers it
takes in a language and prints out a
phrase to toast with in that language
and this is what initialization looks
like for the beer struct again I'm using
the automatically generated member wise
initializer to set our style and percent
alcohol properties and here in the
sidebar you can see that a logger with
six percent alcohol has been
instantiated as usual we can access the
computed property suggested volume for
serving with dot syntax now I want to
open up the console for a second so we
can see our results remember that
because Cheers is a type method we call
it on the struct itself so we call it on
beer and then let's pick a language we
want to toast in let's toast in Japanese
and then we can look over in our console
and see come by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
