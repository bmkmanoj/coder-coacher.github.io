that was a good animal to use for a
magic trick to have it come out of the
Hat so how did that work there wasn't
anything tricky about the code itself it
really is literally doing what I said
which is taking the weights that you
give it multiplying them by the feature
values for each of the animals computing
a score and then sorting so here's what
happened when I gave it the values that
I just had in the code here and you see
that just like the numbers that you use
for the numbers that I used rabbit ended
up in this this fourth position isn't
this position that's labeled number
three but you can change these values
you get a different ordering for
everything but you always get rabbit
coming out in that position and so
that's that's the little bit of
trickiness right I had to set things up
so that rabbit would always come out in
exactly this position the other ones can
change values but rabbit can't and the
way that I did this is by making sure
that in all of these lists and all these
different feature values the rabbit was
always the fourth highest and it was
always higher than mouse frog and
sparrow and always smaller than dog
shark lion horse human hippopotamus and
elephant they can have different
orderings relative to each other but
they always have to have the same or
during relative to to rabbit and so once
we've actually combine all these weights
together what we'll find is that
whatever the wait is that the total
score is going to be for rabbit for
example horse has to be bigger because
it's bigger on every single one of the
dimensions so when we take this
non-negative weighted combination it's
going to keep that property as it is and
that's that's the magic trick there's
one other thing I could have done but I
didn't do which is to have two different
animals who always have exactly opposite
values on some feature so that no matter
what combination i use they they're
either let's say frog and shark that
either frog is below and shark is above
or shark is above and frog is below but
I wanted to stay as close as possible to
the actual values that I was able to
find
the Internet as you might imagine these
aren't actually the values that I found
I found values and then I tweaked them
to make sure that the property held</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
