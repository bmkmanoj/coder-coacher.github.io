customers for a physical channel so what
does that mean so imagine your JetBlue
and you now have a new airline route
going from LaGuardia in the United
States in New York City down to Florida
Orlando and you really want to get
people to know about this new airline
route well the first thing you're gonna
use is earned and paid media you might
run TV ads you might run radio spots and
newspapers or your website you might
send out email and the first thing
you're doing with this paid media is
you're trying to get people aware that
you even have a flight from New York to
Orlando and so this first step in a
physical channel is generating awareness
people just need to know that this thing
exists now the bad news is that your ad
agencies and whatever could tell you how
many people this ad will reach but they
can't quite tell you yet how many will
purchase but you're interested in ok did
they hear this the next thing that you
might want is to know are they
interested nowadays even in physical
channels we could see it the name I hit
the JetBlue web site and did they push
the button on fares from Orlando in New
York to Orlando is there some interest
or do they call your 1-800 number but
really where it finally gets engaging in
a physical channel is there are people
actually asking for the schedules and
are hitting the how much does it cost
page in fact what you really want to be
tracking is are people calling
reservations or if this was a car
dealership are they showing up in the
dealer taking the car out for a test
drive
that's consideration and in a physical
channel it's really interesting to
measure the difference between how many
people did my ads or free media reach
versus how many did I get into my
physical channel to actually consider
the product let me show it up in the
store how many showed up on my website
how many called the 800 number and it's
this space between actually doing and
this is what makes it so hard in
physical channels is all the effort on
paid and earned media you really don't
know where those customers are until
they're physically inside your channel
considering the purchase and then of
course when they click I'll buy it or
tell a dealer I'll take the car or in
JetBlue's case actually say I'll buy
this fare or booked the seat do you
finally understand whether you have the
order or not and that's what acquisition
looks like in a physical channel
awareness consideration and purchase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
