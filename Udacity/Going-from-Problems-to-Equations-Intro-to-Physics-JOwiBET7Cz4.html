straight up in the air 20 meters per
second I want to know what's the highest
point above the ground that the ball
reaches now this question is tricky in
several ways let's first try to identify
our knowns what was given to us
well we throw it straight up with 20 m/s
and velocity that's gotta be the initial
velocity because that's how fast it's
going at the beginning of the problem
now since this is a problem that's
taking place on earth and the object is
in free motion I of course know the
acceleration is 10 meters per second
squared
but then I'm sort of stuck what is the
highest point above the ground that the
ball reaches well highest point seems
important but I'm still a little
confused and without a picture I'm not
gonna make much progress in this
question so let's draw a picture of what
happens when you throw a ball straight
in the air with some initial velocity
what goes up up up up up up up up up
eventually it stops and turns around and
then comes back down okay so this
highest point I can see is some sort of
change in position the problem gives me
the initial velocity and I know the
acceleration I'll need one more piece of
information if I'm gonna solve for Delta
X if you've been listening very
carefully I gave a hint which of these
two variables do we actually know when
the balls at the top of its trajectory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
