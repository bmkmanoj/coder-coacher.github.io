in sunshine our key lines guide us in
laying out the top today section we
begin with the grid layout declaration
note that we are using the support
library version so you will have to
prefix grid layout specific XML
attributes with app and include the res
Auto schema we use a column count of two
adding a column count isn't strictly
necessary as you can just specify the
row and column of each child but it does
simplify the Declaration of each of the
children our first child is the space
widget space is a lightweight view
subclass that is used to create gaps
between components it can be used
anywhere but it's actually part of the
grid layout support library will have
this space widget span both columns with
a column span of two will give it a
column weight of one so it will take up
all available width and a row weight of
1 so it will participate in getting any
extra row space and the layout is
complete first of all the 16 DP spaces
using the padding horizontal material
constant from the support library above
and below the text view or generated
from layout margin attributes remember
that adding a layout margin actually
changes the borders around your layout
we're using material Styles here in this
case we're using the title style and
applying the standard sans-serif font
family with our secondary text color
from the material theme since the title
text appearance uses a different font
weight in color note the use of the
tools dot text feature here this allows
us to populate the viewit text for the
purposes of editing without impacting
the production code this view also spans
both columns because we want column
weight to be calculated for both columns
we must have it here and everywhere we
declare a child
we're finally actually using both
columns as before we need to declare a
column weight so the grid view will
distribute the extra weight we're
finally actually using both columns as
before we need to declare a column
weight to the grid view we'll distribute
the extra weight a couple of notes about
the image view I'm using max height and
max width along with adjust view back
to limit the size of our weather image
this allows more flexibility in layout
but still allows us to have a theme
image that may be larger than our layout
size the image view also uses a source
tag with the tools names based to
display an image in the editor tools we
set up the forecast text view and the
low-temperature text view in the same
way as the columns in the previous row
note that we're actually giving the
low-temperature text view a margin we're
just applying across both columns
finally we add another space widget with
a row weight to keep the rest the
content centered within the grid layout
and that's it we had the top of our
detail layout which is included from
detail today grid XML the rest is up to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
