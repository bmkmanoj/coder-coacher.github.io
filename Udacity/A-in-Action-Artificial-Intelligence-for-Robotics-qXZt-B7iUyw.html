the DARPA urban challenge the Stanford
tire car trying to find a way to amaze
and as you can see the mesas changing as
the car moves as reflects of the fact
that the Coyotes it sends us to see
obstacles and obstacles are sometimes
included and the car can only see them
when they nearby what's really
remarkable here is that the car is able
to plan really complex maneuvers to the
goal at any point in time you can see
its best guess to have a path to the
goal and the orange trees are a-star
search trees they aren't exactly grids
trees our car moves differently from a
grid based robot it can turn at
different angles and each of these
little steps is a different turning
angle combined with a different forward
motion but leaving the society you get
these amazing trees that find paths all
the way to the goal using a star this
implementation is so fast that it can
plan these paths in less than 10
milliseconds for any location in this
maze there was faster than any other
driving team that I know of at the DARPA
Grand Challenge or the DARPA urban
challenge the planning is repeated every
time the robot cancels the previous plan
you can see additional adjustments at
place at times but as you go through
this video you can see how a star
planning with a simple Euclidean
distance your istic is able to find a
path to the goal when you implement this
yourself the big difference to our grid
implementation is a different motion
model you have to implement a robot that
is able to turn and you have to write on
the math of a robot it's able to turn
and go forward
this robot also can revert so going back
path is a discrete different action but
other than that it's essentially the
same a style rhythm you just implement
it so if you want to build a
self-driving car you know understand to
make a video game to find a path to a go
so this is seen where'd our prot trapped
our car using a barrier that went all
across the street so the only way for
the car to navigate this was to take a
multi pole u-turn you need to plan this
all by itself using a star planning
the car pulls up to the barrier realize
there's no path to go then invokes is a
stop planner and comes up with a
turnaround maneuver that is not
particularly elegant but it's super
effective and the car was able in this
competition by itself to turn around
using a star find the optimal plan to do
so and move on otherwise it would have
been stuck forever behind this obstacle
in this final video I'll show you a
parking situation where the car has to
back into a parking space between two
other cars and you can see how the
obstacles are visible how these other
cars are visible and how our vehicle jr.
navigates an actual parking lot again
this is using a star it finds its way
optimally into this parking spot backs
in and backs out again all by itself
the planning time for each of these a
star runs is less than 10 milliseconds
and the car was able to competently do
this even though in advance at no clue
where the obstacles were and by the
parking spot was that is a star for
forward path planning and what you've
implemented yourself is the core of it
again if you want to turn it into a real
robotic motion algorithm you have to
change the motion model and you have to
see the next class I'm teaching you or
when I go to continuous values and show
how to turn this into a continuous
motion path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
