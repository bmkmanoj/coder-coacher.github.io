architectural style that became
pervasive was called the master control
that issued right a top-level routine
that was responsible for organizing the
use of the lower-level routines some of
the other ones listed on this particular
listed listed here are more recent
message bus is an analogy with the bus
the hardware bus that organizes
computations on a chip message bus often
means asynchronous message passing over
some common data channel with your
smartphone or other mobile devices there
are a set of constraints that you have
to deal with that you wouldn't have to
deal with in other kinds of applications
so architectural style in support of
mobile code where there might be remote
remote evaluation and you have agents at
various places on a network is is an
example of a mobile code architectural
style the term object-oriented
architectural style is a little bit
different than object-oriented
programming or object oriented
programming language with the object
oriented architectural style we still
have objects but each of those objects
have an independent existence that is
they're running all the time they have
their own thread of control and they're
sending message to each messages to each
other asynchronous messages this allows
them to cooperatively address a address
the problem being solved peer-to-peer
networks you may have heard of here
there are equal parties sharing
responsibility for providing whatever
services plug-in architecture if you are
familiar with some interactive
development environments like eclipse
you know that there's a whole registry
of available additional functionality
that you can plug into Eclipse and the
mechanism for doing that is a very
powerful way of adding extensibility two
systems pipe and filter you've seen
before with a quick quick exercise when
you haven't seen probably is process
control think here nuclear reactor think
here your speed control on your
our situation is you have some ongoing
hardware process and you'd like a
corresponding software application to
control that process if the process is
going too fast you want to slow it down
if it's going to slow you want to speed
it up this is called process control and
its key element is some kind of feedback
loop from the artificial intelligence
world there's production systems these
are essentially a collection of rules
and the conditions under which the rules
fire it enables the modeling of systems
where we don't have a clear idea of what
the control flow needed to implement the
system a very popular one these days is
is rest rest stands for representational
state transfer and you can think here
it's those internet applications that
are using HTTP that often have a
client-server type relationship that are
stateless that is each of the user
requests are handled independently and
with some potentially some caching going
on to improve performance
service-oriented architecture or SOA is
where we have carved up the
functionality of the system into
separate services that is from the users
point of view a service is a unit a
self-contained unit of functionality and
that means that we have to imagine the
architecture of the system as being able
to support a set of set of services
these are typically done in support of
enterprise type applications and often
with with Internet connectivity between
the user requests through some browser
and the ultimate service being provided
by some server shared nothing is a term
for distributed database with no sharing
across across the nodes I don't have
personally have a lot of experience with
that one state transition systems on the
other hand are very common particularly
if you have a situation where the system
is driven by events asynchronous events
and has to react to those events a
typical example is if you got a GUI and
the user is providing the events but it
could also be some kind of real-time
system where
events are coming from the outside world
shared memory we saw from the from the
quick exercise and finally we have table
driven interpreter for certain kinds of
applications where the requests take the
form of simple expressions in some kind
of language we can deal with those
requests by having a an interpreter the
interpreter is essentially taking the
request parsing it and then invoking the
whatever procedure is required to deal
with that specific request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
