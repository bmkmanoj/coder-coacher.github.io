our video production process as well as
get you up to speed with the tools
necessary to implement all the creative
ideas that you have the orientation will
get you familiar with our video
production process as well as give you
first-hand experience with being on
camera
you'll also be introduced to our tablet
recording studios as well as a recording
process hey Taylor I can't seem to
figure out what my microphone doesn't
work Jeff that's because the camera's
not turned on oh wow
thanks Taylor you're welcome we're
always here to help if you've never been
in front of the camera before don't
worry these videos are just for practice
students won't see them and if I can be
honest with you when I was first on
camera I was terrible Oh Who am I
supposed to say that line there yeah and
if you want to know which traits are
identical or not and see if they both
have it or not
if yeah and if you want to find out
whether or not you were looking down one
more time
but preparation and practice have made
me better and these two aspects of what
we will cover among other things in the
orientation we'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
