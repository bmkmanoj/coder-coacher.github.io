computer it's a good idea to document
your code and use comments Java comments
help you and people who may read your
code understand what that code is doing
and we've already been using comments to
leave notes to ourselves we've been
using single line comments that start
with the double slash and there are a
couple more ways to write comments if
you have a more descriptive comment you
can use a multi-line comment these are
the same kind of note to self comments
as single line comments but they start
with the slash and an asterisk and then
they end with an asterisk
Venna slash but both these kinds of
comments will stay inside your code and
then there's a third style Java
documentation or Java doc comments these
are the comments that generate what you
see when you look at Java documentation
pages so this kind of comment lets you
generate document descriptions and it
starts with a slash and two asterisks
then each line starts with a single
asterisk and it ends with an asterisk
slash just like our multi-line comment
did and there are tools that help you
generate comments like this
automatically so don't worry too much
about this syntax most importantly this
kind of comment lets you divide up a
general description of your function
description of any parameters it may
need and a description of its return
value if it has one the general
description always goes at the top of
one of these comments then if you want
to add parameter descriptions you have
to type at per am then the name of the
parameter and then a description of it
and you can do these for multiple
parameters similarly for the return
output you type at return and then the
description of that return value let's
see an example here's a sample javadoc
comment for our earlier rule dice
function if you remember this function
was called roll dice and it returned a
randomly generated dice roll it also
took in the number of sides that a dice
had to generate the correct range for
that dice roll the first part of the
comment gives us a general description
of the function that tells us that this
returns a random dice roll given the
number of sides of a dice next I just
of the parameter requires there's only
one parameter named sides which is the
number of size the dice has and finally
a description for the returned value an
int value that's a random roll and when
you write Java dot comments like this
there's even software that will
automatically generate documentation
that looks like what we saw for math dot
random and math max so if you want to
write your own Java documentation it's
as easy as including it in your code
comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
