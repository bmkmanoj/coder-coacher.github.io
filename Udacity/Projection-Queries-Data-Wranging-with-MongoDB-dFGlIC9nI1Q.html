before we move on to some more advanced
query topics is the ability to specify a
projection document in addition to our
query document for calls to find now
what projection does is it essentially
describes the shape we would like
documents to take in the result set I'm
also going to break this out a little
bit here with a query end projection
variable and pass those defined instead
of directly passing the dictionary that
we constructed to find I point this out
merely because we'll see this again
later on in the lesson and I don't want
anyone to be confused now let's imagine
that instead of getting back all of the
documents for our query specifying
constraints on manufacturer in class we
actually are only interested in getting
the name of the document back well we
could simply print out the name down
here but another way we can do that is
by specifying a projection as a second
parameter to find and what that's going
to do is say all of the result documents
that come back instead of having their
full contents I only want to see name
now by default unless we explicitly say
I don't want to see the ID field will
also get ID so that's why I've got ID
set to zero here okay so the way we do
this is essentially we specify all the
fields for the documents in this
collection and then specify whether or
not we want them to occur in our result
set all right let's run this alright and
here we can see that the documents we
get back simply have the name field in
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
