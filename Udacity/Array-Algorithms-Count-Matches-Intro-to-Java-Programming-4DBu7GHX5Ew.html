the elements that match a certain
criteria when you have a picture we say
that the picture is in landscape
orientation if it is wider than it is
tall most but not all of these pictures
of course contain a landscape we say
that the picture is in portrait
orientation if it is taller than it is
wide now let's say we have a bunch of
pictures and we want to count how many
of them are in portrait orientation
that's an example of a counting problem
in general you keep a counter you visit
each element if the element is a match
for whatever it is that you're looking
for you increment the counter what does
it mean to be a match
well that depends on the problem if you
have an array of bacteria you might be
looking for the ones that are beneficial
if you have an array of pictures like we
have in our example we happen to want to
know the ones that are portrait those
are the ones for which the height is
greater than the width now that's your
job in the next quiz complete the
program so that it counts how many
pictures are taller than their way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
