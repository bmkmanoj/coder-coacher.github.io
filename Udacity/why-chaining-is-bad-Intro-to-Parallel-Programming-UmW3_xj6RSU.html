going to do useful work the actual
fraction ends up being zero point five
one six and I'll say how I got that so
we've got 32 threads here I'm putting
them on the x-axis and then on the
y-axis is the number of iterations and
so we know that one thread will find its
answer on the first iteration the next
thread will find its answer on the
second iteration and so on so why don't
we say the first thread finds its answer
on the first iteration the second thread
will find its answer on the second
iteration and so on so eventually the
last thread will take 32 iterations to
find its answer and what that means is
that it has spent 32 iterations walking
through this length list we have 32
threads times 32 iterations so the
amount of work we could have that's
useful is sort of the product of the
number of threads and the number of
iterations so we see all of this area in
that square as being useful these
threads are doing useful work they're
walking through the link list until they
find their item right here and stop but
all the blue area here on the other hand
is wasted work we have threads that have
gone to sleep because they've already
found their item and now they're not
doing anything useful they're just
waiting for the last thread to finish so
if you actually do the math in detail
what you'll find is the red area
compared to the entire square is
slightly more than half but basically
what we're looking at here is that
roughly half the time if we pick any
random thread it's going to be asleep
and waiting for some other thread to
finish so it can progress to the next
computation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
