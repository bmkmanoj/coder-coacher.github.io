a converter which takes a dictionary and
a date as its inputs the dictionary
converts the number of the month to the
name of the month and the date is in the
format month day year which I've written
up here so we don't forget the order and
the output should be in the form day
name of the month year so how we going
to split up month day and year well the
way we're going to do that is to look
for the forward slashes in the string
the first forward slash we can find at
the position between the month and the
day so everything up to the first
forward slash is the month so the month
is equal to everything up to the first /
and that's exclusive so it doesn't
include the slash itself the second / we
can find by looking from the first /
onwards so we look at the position one
after the first / to find the second /
we know it's somewhere there we can't
say it's exactly two steps after or one
step or something because the day could
be one digit or two digits so the day is
between the first / and the second /
note that we have to add one onto first
because we want to go one position after
the slash and it's inclusive for the
first place here exclusive for the
second and then year is the date from
one position after the second forward
slash so now we've got the day the month
in the year we need to turn it into the
format to return it so we're going to
return the string which is day in a
space then the month and then the year
now month we need to look up in our
dictionary so we're going to look it up
in the dictionary but we can't just put
month in straight away because
month is a string and the dictionary
uses a number as its index so we have to
turn the string into an integer and then
we need a space again and finally the
year on the end so that's the first
method the second method is much shorter
and it uses a procedure you've seen
before but something that you may not
know about that procedure so I'll show
it you just for completeness is sake we
can get the month the day and the year
by splitting the date and using an input
for that split now split without an
input just split some white space split
with an input splits on whatever that
input is so date split were split into
month day and year and we can use a
triple assignment to get those out
straight away and then we just need to
return exactly the same as we returned
before so that's a very simple way of
writing it which does exactly the same
as the first one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
