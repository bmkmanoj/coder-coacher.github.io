more superstitious and about in this
case I feel like I'd hear a lot of
people in the younger generation to be
like that's great now we can find out
different things whereas with the older
generations I feel like we'd hear a lot
of you should never play with that kind
of stuff you don't know what's going to
happen and even though it's just in this
case testing it leads to trying to fix
things or trying to change things in
order to stop you know you don't know
where it's going to go from here from
push definitely we don't know i think
that the public sort of understanding of
this sort of genetic information is sort
of twofold i think one there's sort of
this science fictiony sort of portrayal
of of this will be the end all this will
be sir that answers that you will you
will find out like are you going to
develop Alzheimer's not sort of the
understanding of probability so I think
there's a lot of stock in this
information that may not have come to
fruition yet scientifically I think the
other end of it is there's a lot of
mystery and a lot of mysticism behind it
and a lot of curiosity and and just lack
of understanding Carol you were going to
say something too I had seen an article
written by a medical ethicist it just
was very coincidental and his point of
view is that people like us should not
have access to genetic information that
this is up to the physicians so people
like us is just the general public the
general public and I debated him on this
issue and
it I think that in the medical community
and in probably in education where
people are sitting in their ivory tower
they think that the general public
shouldn't have access to this
information and I think that sells
people short particularly today we're in
the age of the computer age where
everything is on facebook and on twitter
and I mean it's open people want to know
and I think that it's going to change
radically I think part of what strong
was saying about there's the two sides
of it people think put too much stock in
it or there's this change no
misunderstanding of mysticism about is
the fact that this kind of availability
of information is so new I mean 23andme
just about eight years ago caused
thousand dollars and now it's under a
hundred and so it's only now that we're
starting to it's only now available to
the general public and those questions
of should the general public be allowed
to have this information in the state of
where I'm from in Maryland at 23 m easy
illegal you cannot believe you cannot 23
Emmy will not ship to Maryland or New
York because if the state has passed
that genetic information can only come
from a doctor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
