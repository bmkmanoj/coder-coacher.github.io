to convert just one clause from CNF to
3-cnf this is going to be the heart of
the argument because we're gonna be able
to apply this procedure to each Clause
of the formula independently so consider
this one Clause consisting of literals
z1 through ZK we're going to have three
cases depending on the number of
literals in each Clause note that I've
left off k equals three since nothing
needs to be done in that case when there
are two literals in the clause the
situation is easiest to understand
we just need to boost up the number of
literals to three to do this we include
a single extra variable and trade in the
clause z1 or z2 for these two clauses
here one with the literal y1 and one
with the literal y1 not if in a truth
assignment z1 or z2 is satisfied then
clearly both these have to be true on
the other hand taking a satisfying
assignment for these clauses here the Y
literal has to be false in one of these
two clauses and so therefore z1 or z2
must be true we can play the same trick
when there's just one literal z1 in the
original clause this time we need to
introduce two new variables which we'll
call y1 and y2 then we replace the
original clause with these four note
that if Z 1 is true then all four of
these clauses are true as well on the
other hand for any given truth
assignment for z1 y1 and y2 that
satisfies these four clauses the Y
literals have to both be false in one of
these and that then implies that Z 1 is
true lastly we have the case where K is
greater than 3 here we introduced K
minus 3 variables and use them to break
up the clauses according to this pattern
let's illustrate this idea with an
example consider the sixth literal
clause here looking at this we might
wish that we could have a single
variable that captured whether any of
these first four literals were true
let's call this variable y3 then we can
express this overall clause with just
three the literals y3 or z5 or z6 at
first I said
we wanted y3 to be equal to z1 or z2 or
z3 or z4 but actually it's sufficient
and considerably less trouble for y3
just to imply the truth of one of those
literals this idea is easy to express as
a clause either y3 is false in which
case the implication doesn't apply or
one of z1 through z4 better be true
together these two clauses imply the
first one if y3 is true then Y 3 bar is
false and so one of the Z 1 to Z 4 must
be true and so must the original clause
on the other hand if y3 is false then z5
or z6 must be true and so must the
original clause also if the original
clause is satisfied then we can set Y 3
equal to the disjunction of z1 through
z4 and these two clauses will be
satisfied as well note that we went from
having a longest clause length of 6 to
having one of length 5 and another of
length 3 we can apply the strategy again
to the clause that's too long by
introducing another variable Y 2 and
trade this long clause in for a shorter
clause this time one of length four and
one of length three of course we can
play this trick again and eventually we
have just three literal clauses this
example is for K equals six but an
inductive argument will show that the
argument works for any K greater than
three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
