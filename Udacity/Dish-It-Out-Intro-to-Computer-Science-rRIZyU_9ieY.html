that both the main-dish and appetizer
classes inherit from and dish will have
both in it and stir methods for
initializing and representing the dish
as a string in both main-dish and
appetizer we're going to need to
override those methods to provide the
additional behavior that we need for the
extra attributes of sides and serves so
that's one approach let me show you what
that looks like in code here's what that
looks like in code we're defining in the
dish class its base classes object it's
an it method initializes all these
attributes and we've got the two with
default values and its store class turns
it into a string using format like this
this is a little complicated but you've
seen this code before so I won't
describe it again here then the main
dish class is a subclass of dish so it's
base classes dish he uses super here it
uses super to get the dish init method
and adds sides to it and then an its
store method it uses the super class
astir method and adds the extra
information about the sites the
appetizer class is similar it also
inherits from dish in this case we're
adding serves and we're adding the
information about service we avoided a
lot of duplication by using the super
store method and the super init method
here to inherit those from the dish
class if you don't like all those supers
there's another way we might do this we
still have the same class hierarchy and
we still have the same init methods but
instead of overriding stir in main-dish
and appetizer we're gonna have an extras
method and what extras we'll do is print
all the extra information about that
particular type of dish so here's what
that code looks like this is all the
same we've changed the store method for
dish by adding extras to it and extras
is the result of calling the extras
method on self now we can define main
dish like this note that we don't need a
store method in main dish we inherit
exactly the store method is defined in
dish and we add extras that prints out
the number of sides similarly we can
define appetizer we don't need to store
method and we define extras to return a
string giving the information about how
many people it serves which of these two
is better matter of opinion I think this
one is not yet better the way to make
this one better would be to use has
attribute to make it so it works for
other kinds of dishes which we haven't
defined yet that don't even have an
extra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
