with a series of hypotheses that's all
you have on day one if you're a domain
expert maybe you know a little more but
it's okay because you're just kind of
guessing here you start with well here's
who I think my customers are but then
you get out of the building and you
start running experiments and you find
out oh I was right or more often on your
first guesses I was wrong and because
we're going to do these experiments
cheaply inexpensively and upfront we're
going to save all the enormous waste we
would do if we waited until we launched
the product and did an expensive
marketing campaign and then only then
realizing that oops
these weren't our customers or these
were our customers but we built the
wrong features so let's dive down a
level deeper and first focus on what's
the jobs needed to be done that is
what's the customer segments trying to
get done and is it a problem or need now
this phrase jobs to be done was first
popularized by Clayton Christensen who
wrote a series of books the innovators
dilemma and the innovators solution
should probably be on any entrepreneurs
reading list and what Christensen said
is look what functional or social jobs
are getting done that is does the
customer want to perform or complete a
specific task or solve a problem or
trying to look good gain power status or
there's some emotional jobs do they want
to look better feel good have feel more
secure and what basic needs are you
helping your customer satisfy is it
entertainment as dating is it something
hardwired into the human psyche</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
