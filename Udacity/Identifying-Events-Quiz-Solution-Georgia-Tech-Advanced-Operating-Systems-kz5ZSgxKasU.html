events that are within a single process
like all these events are events within
my process these events are within
experience process these events are
within Delta process and I'm sure that
most of you have identified all these as
events that are connected by they happen
before relationship and here I'm showing
you all the events that are connected by
the communication events is a message
sending from me to Expedia bees a
receipt of that message similarly C to D
and E to F G 2 h i j k l those are all
the communication events all of them are
connected by has happened before
relationship and if you look at this
event m that's a concurrent event with
respect to the events that are happening
on my process as well as the delta
process so those are the things that
I've marked as concurrent events if you
didn't get all of these right that's
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
