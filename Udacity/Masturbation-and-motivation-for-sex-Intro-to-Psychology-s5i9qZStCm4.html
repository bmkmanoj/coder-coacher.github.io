masturbation or self-love or self
pleasuring it has a couple different
names yes it's it's normal for people to
have feelings of loving themselves or
touching themselves at least from like a
biological point of view totally
normative although there are rare
exceptions to that of course some
people's sexual orientation happens to
be asexual and they might not have any
desire whatsoever to engage in self-love
or self touch but on average across the
globe most humans engage in some sort of
self touch unless the society culture
religion dictates otherwise and then
they might not engage in that but in
general there are lots of reasons why
people masturbate masturbate it relieves
sexual tension it provides a venue for
self exploration
it can be a shared experience so people
might engage in mutual masturbation
either where they masturbate each other
or they might just engage in self touch
in front of each other and it can help
people physically relax so it can
relieve just physical pressure that
someone might have our daily stress one
of the things I really recommend for
people though is they should be
masturbating in a way that's congruent
with their own beliefs and so if it's
something that does make them feel
uncomfortable then then they should you
know back off and and figure out another
way to do things that might make them
feel better there are tons of techniques
that people can use from just using
digital masturbation with their hands to
toys to water - you know another partner
so on and so forth and so there's lots
of different ways that people can
masturbate and they really just have to
find one that that is congruent with
their own beliefs and that they enjoy
and that's comfortable and healthy for
them so how can sexual behavior actually
be used as a motivator yes so I
definitely there are motivations that
people have for having sex there are in
the United States there's three primary
reasons for having sex or kind of the
privation behind having sex the first is
for traditional or reproductive reasons
about 30% of us Americans really believe
in this traditional reproductive
framework and what I mean by that is
they really think that the number one
motivation for sex is to procreate to
have children and typically that's
within the confines of a monogamous
relationship typically one that's either
domestic partner door or a marital
relationship so in terms of motivation
about 30% of the time it has something
to do with with actual procreation and
attempting to to make children the next
big reason is typically a recreational
reason or motivation about 25% of people
in the US are having sex for those
reasons and it does tend to be more men
than women and recreationally means that
in said in its simplest way if it feels
good and doesn't hurt anybody then let's
do it and and like I said that's about a
quarter of the people and and typically
more men than women and the final big
motivator for sex or a reason behind sex
it's a relational point of view and
that's actually become the most common
reason or motivator for sex it's about
45% of the people in the United States
and this is this idea that sex ideally
should be accompanied with strong
feelings or affection for someone but
not necessarily for procreation not
really for procreation and not really
only in the confines of a monogamous or
a partner or a marital context and again
most people right now at least in the US
view sex as being more of this
relational viewpoint and that's the main
motivation so I really like someone and
I don't want to be married but I still
want to be close with them an intimate
with them and so I'm gonna have sex with
them that's that's typically the most
common motivation right now is really
this kind of affection allure feeling
based motivation for sex so is there
anything else people need to know about
human sexuality well I think it's
helpful for people to understand
a couple things around sexuality whether
it's their motivations or a social
component to sexuality and that is what
I always tell my students is that if you
can't talk about sex you probably
shouldn't be having sex and so if people
can't engage in some sort of basic
dialogue about their sexual wants needs
experiences past practices future
practices health if there's a history of
sexually transmitted infection or
disease if you can't have conversations
about sex you probably don't have much
business engaging in it at least not
with someone other than yourself so
that's really the biggest point that I
think people regardless of the lesson
that we're giving them that's really the
biggest lesson that they need to know
around human sexuality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
