a series of sticks because that's all I
can draw but that's not really what we
see we see a human body if we take a
magnifying glass to a part of this and
really zoom in on this region what do we
see we see cells in fact we see
something like 10 to the 13 cells that's
a one followed by 13-0 it's a massive
number but let's not stop there let's
zoom in on a cell that's a magnifying
glass by the way if we zoom it in the
cell we see that it's made up of
molecules and those molecules are made
up of atoms and here I've drawn a single
atom this adam has three interesting
parts here in the center of the nucleus
the red and the blue dots i'm using the
red dot to represent the proton the
proton has a charge of 1.6 times 10 to
the negative 19 coulombs also in the
nucleus we have the neutrons which have
a charge of 0 so we call them neutral
and orbiting around outside the nucleus
we have electrons and electrons have a
charge of negative 1 point 6 times 10 to
the negative 19 coulombs same as the
proton but negative each of the cells
each of the 10 to the 13 cells in the
human body has about 10 to the 15
protons 10 to 15 neutrons and 10 to 15
electrons so my question is using all of
this data you have here of these numbers
I want you to tell me what is the net or
total charge remember q is charged on
the human body enter your answer here in
coulombs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
