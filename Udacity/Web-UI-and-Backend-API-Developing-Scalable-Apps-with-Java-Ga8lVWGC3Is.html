includes both a back-end application
that defines the endpoint functions and
front-end application that has the web
pages that use those functions so I'm
going to call the backend application
basically I'm going to refer to it as
the backend API and the part of the
application that has the web pages I'm
going to refer to as the web UI now in
our case they're all in one single
application I've got one app ID you
deploy the app takes the backend API and
takes the web UI with it
however the web UI and the backend API
don't have to be in the same application
they could be in completely separate
applications or you could even have
multiple applications that provide
different front-end interfaces to the
conference back-end API so here we've
got several different applications each
with a different kind of web UI and we
have our conference API running here on
the back-end API
however in our case the web UI and the
backend API are in the same application
but App Engine doesn't really care that
they're in the same application you
still have to authorize a front-end UI
to access the backend API so there's a
few things you need to do before you can
start using the web pages in the
conference central application and these
are all around authorizing the web UI
for login and giving the web UI
permission to use the backend API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
