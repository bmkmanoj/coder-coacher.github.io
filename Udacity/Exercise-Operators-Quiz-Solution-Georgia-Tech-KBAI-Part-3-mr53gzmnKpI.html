descend ladder operator is pretty
similar to the climb ladder operator we
still have to have a dry ladder in order
to climb up or down the ladder this time
in order to climb down the ladder we
have to already be on the ladder so our
preconditions are that we're on the
ladder and latter is dry our post
condition is that we're now on the floor
so we just kind of flipped the clan
ladder operator for paint ceiling we
know that the robot has to already be on
the ladder in order to reach the ceiling
so the precondition here is that the
robot is on the ladder after its painted
ceiling we have two things the ceiling
is now painted and the ladder is not dry
we haven't seen this before but this
goes back to what you were saying a show
about we have to explicitly negate
things that were true in the world
before the ceiling was dry but now it's
not dry similarly for painting the
ladder the robot has to be on the floor
it can't paint the latter wallet
standing on it and the post condition is
the ladder is painted and the latter is
not try this is right David that is not
a couple of other things first note how
propositional logic is providing
precision to the specification of these
operators that's the power of logic it
provides clarity and precision the other
is once again note the de preconditions
have only positive literals while the
post conditions may have negative
literals as well so shocked why is it
that we can't have negative literals in
our precondition why can't we just say
not painted ladder instead of dry ladder
David this has to do something with a
history of these notations this notation
comes from scripts a planner developed
in the late 60s that is Stanford
Research Institute one of the early
robot planners that ran on a robot
called shaky strips the planner use
theorem proving to form plants and it
turned out that the use of only positive
literals any preconditions may deter
improving processes more efficient this
convention is just stayed in AI since
the time of strips and shaky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
