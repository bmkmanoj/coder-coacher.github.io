you dive in head first or whether you
take baby steps I think the answer is
probably that YouTube both meaning you
you find a place where you know you can
make a difference so maybe that's going
to be through the automation of your
infrastructure or maybe that's going to
be improving test coverage maybe it's
going to be implementing some continuous
integration or even a step toward
continuous delivery and you should
really dive in with the full intention
to realize that value at the same time
though you want you want out you want
serve agile principles to be able to
work for you in this context so I don't
know how a mountain goat approaches the
mountain right but i think it's with the
intention of getting where it wants to
go but how does it do it it takes a
tentative step at each time it tests a
little bit right how did that work for
me and then moves forward and I think
that's the way that you should do it so
you should bring your whole self your
whole intention to to the effort let me
just give an example of what going
all-in could mean in a negative way or
in a different context you want to buy
all the things you write you buy all the
software you hire a giant team like I
don't think you have to start in that
way I think what you have to be clear
about is where you want to get to and
what thing you're going to do first to
make an impact and I think that's the
thing you go all-in on often the places
where a devops engineer is going to be
asked to start working are in the places
where the organization is feeling the
most pain or suffering the most so I
guess there's nobility there in the same
way that there is for an early responder
I got to want to make this overly
dramatic there's a book that I really
love it's called your code is a crime
scene like and if that's real and
there's some evidence to support that
idea I'm the devops engineer shows up in
that space and is going to work to make
things better so all in on an area in
which you can make an effort that's
really going to pay off all in in some
global sense like I
have to decide early on what tooling I
pay for I have to decide early on on
what methodologies i use I think that
might be a mistake as a matter of fact
you'd be creating structure ahead of any
kind of learning and that might be
damaging so I like the mountain goat
metaphor you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
