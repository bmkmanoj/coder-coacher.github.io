3 you are asked to define a procedure
union that takes inputs as two lists and
modifies the first input list to be the
set union of the two input lists we had
the list of pages to crawl as well as
the list of pages that we found linked
from the current site and we want to
combine those two the new list of pages
to crawl so that's what we needed Union
for so that's what we did was define a
procedure that took the two input lists
and output a list that was their union
this made sense in cs101 because we were
learning about lists and had a program
on lists but doesn't make a lot of sense
if your real goal is to actually do what
we needed for the search engine so for
this quiz what I want you to think about
is which of the falling would be the
best thing to do if instead of doing
this as a program exercise to learn to
program you are trying to build a search
engine and realize that what you needed
to do was Union the links that you had
to search with the new links that you
found from the current page here are the
options select the one that you think
would be the best one to do first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
