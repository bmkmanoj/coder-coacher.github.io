the easiest way to figure out this
answer would be to take our single
strand of DNA and fill in the other side
once we filled in the other side we want
to count the number of guanine zor geez
that we see Lauren how many go on ins DC
66 exactly we have 6 g's now what we
want to do is take the number of guanine
6 and divide it by the total number of
letters we have in our molecule and
you'll see in a double-stranded DNA we
have 10 on one side and 10 on the other
and six divided by twenty is thirty
percent but is there another way that we
can do this without filling out the
other strand so there actually is
another way figuring this out without
looking at the other side let's put our
question marks back where they were
before just look at the first strand of
ten letters now you see here we could
just count the number of guanine and how
many guanine so you see here Lauren 22
two windings total out of well how many
letters but we could just look at the
one strand 10 letters and 2 out of 10 is
only twenty percent we know that's not
right because Lauren already told us he
enters thirty percent but we can't just
add the other strand because that would
be 20 letters and two out of 20 is only
ten percent so we need some more
information what else are we missing
here well could we use the pairs of
cytosine and guanine because you said
that geez and sees pair together right
exactly so if we just look at our
single-strand here we know everywhere
there's a cytosine on this side there's
a guanine on the other side so let's
count the number of side of scenes we
see in our one strand here how many
sightings are here Lauren 44 cytosines
so for side of scenes means we have four
guanine Xin the other side and when if
we count the two bondings from this side
2 plus 4 6 and 6 divided by the total
number of letters which is 20 gives us
30 percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
