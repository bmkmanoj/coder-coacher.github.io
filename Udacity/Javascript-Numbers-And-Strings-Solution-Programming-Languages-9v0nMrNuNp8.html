some of the JavaScript flexing we did in
the previous one and we're going to
handle identifiers numbers and strengths
real click let's ask ourselves what are
the difference between those so we have
an identify ER and as we talked about in
lecture identifiers a name for something
usually function or a variable we then
have numbers and we're going to be able
to handle numbers such as negative 1 2
dot 3.5 judge it cetera then we have
strings this string contains the word
blah an escaped quote so the string
contains this double quote blah ? I
don't know if you heard my Ray's pitch
at the end blah and then another double
quote and then we indicate the end of
the string with unescape double quotes
so we want to write regular expressions
to match these things because that's how
we're going to write the functions that
tell the lexer how to tokenize it so
let's do the identifier first this one's
pretty straightforward we need at least
one letter and it can't be an underscore
but the casing doesn't matter and after
that it can be as long as we want and it
kind of as many underscores as you want
and then letters as well where if the
casing doesn't matter so that's all
regular expression for the identifier
for the number going to be a little
trickier let's say we have this number
negative 542 and 55 thoughts so we're
going to write a regular expression to
match this as well as all the other
numbers but this has all the pieces that
we need to consider in a regular
expression so the first thing is the
minus sign the minus sign can only occur
at the beginning and it's also optional
we then can match at least one but
possibly more numbers up into a decimal
point if it exists but it could also
just end there such as the negative one
we have here so the numbers 0 through 9
and it has to be one or more of them
this goes there this matches that part
now we're going to have a chunk that's
optional if we go down this route we
have to have a period
have to escape the period because it has
meaning and a regular expression but
after the period we can only have
numbers and there can be zero or more of
them 0 for the case where you just ended
a period which is often donated to mean
you want a floating point but in this
case we're going to treat everything
that's a floating point and then a star
so that's a regular expression to go
back the dot goes here these fives go
there so now we just want to do
strengths so we have a regular
expression the first thing and the last
thing we have to match are going to be
the double quotes and I use a single
quote because I don't have to escape the
double quotes in this that makes it nice
in between the double quotes you can
have zero or more characters inside of
them and those characters can be in two
groups it's either escaped like we have
here or it's just a character by itself
all the other letters so let's do the
not escape first so that's going to be
anything that's not a double quote or a
backslash and we have to escape the
backslash if we want to match that so
anything but those so it's going to be
everything here all of this but not
these quotes right here because there's
a back sash or quote there if we get any
one of those we're going to match a
different rule where we have to have a
backslash but after that backslash we
can have any character and that's what
the period means and I forgot to put my
question mark there we go that's the
regular fresh we're going to use as you
can see as these regular expressions
gets more complicated doing more complex
things they get messy messy very very
quickly sometimes it's really convenient
to write it right expression like this
sometimes you might just write a bit of
code to do the same thing but in this
case regular expressions are super
powerful and super fun and that's what
we're doing here so here i have my
solution i'm going to have three types
of tokens the identify or the number in
the string which we went over i have the
identifier which is exactly the regular
expression we came up with and all we do
is identify that type for the
number when it matches we're going to
call float which converged the string
value that is in the token we get it to
an actual floating point number and then
for the string case we're going to strip
off the quotes and just get the contents
of the string itself that's what matters
to us ignore our whitespace have to deal
with new lines and the airs as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
