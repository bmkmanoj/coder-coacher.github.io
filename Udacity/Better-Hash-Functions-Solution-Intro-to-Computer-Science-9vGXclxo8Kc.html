you weren't able to get it yourself
that's okay what I'd encourage you to do
is to stop in the middle of explanation
once the part where you got stuck on
makes sense and see if you can finish it
yourself so what we need to do is define
a function so we're going to find a
function hash string and it takes two
inputs the keyword and the number of
buckets and we're going to keep track of
where we are in the circle we need to
introduce a new variable to do that and
we should start a position 0 so we'll
initialize that variable will use H to
represent the hash and we'll initialize
that 20 now we want to go through the
characters in the keyword so we'll have
a for loop that goes through each
character in keyword and for each
character we want to add to the hash so
we're going to add to the hash the value
of that character we could do the modulo
here so we could at this point use
modulo buckets we have to be careful to
have the parentheses here if we just
have the modulo buckets here we wouldn't
get the right result because it would do
or see modulo buckets but we really need
to do is modulo buckets the sum that we
get from H and artsy and then at the end
we're going to return the hash value we
could instead of doing the modulo each
time here we could do the modulo just
wants it to end that would be computing
a big number if we have a really big
string and then at the end compute at
modulo buckets either way should work
this was a little better in the sense
that if our string is very long we would
have to compute a really really big
number which gets to be more expensive
and we might even run out if it's a
super long keyword so it's better to do
the modulo here we get the same result
either way though let's try this in the
Python interpreter so here's the code
that we wrote out on the sketch pad we
have our variable H which is going to
keep track of the hash value we're going
to go through all the characters in the
keyword adding each one into the hash
value modulo the number of buckets so
let's try the example so a with 12
buckets hashes the bucket one as we
expect and if we look at be it has just
a bucket to also as we expect so one
other thing we should try if you
remember when we had that really bad
hash string function one of the many
problems it has was the
didn't work on all strings in particular
did not work on empty string do you
think our hash string function here will
work on the empty string so try to guess
what the results should be before I run
it and then I will run it and you see
the result is 0 so no error and it makes
sense to the results is 0 we start with
a 2-0 when there are no characters in
the string we don't go through this loop
at all so H is still 0 when we return
and let's also try the longer example
when we hash the string Udacity with 12
buckets we get bucket 11 we should be
able to increase the number of buckets
so let's increase the number of buckets
let's suppose we had thousand buckets
and we get buckets 755 this isn't enough
to convince us that our hash string
function is distributing all strings
well between all buckets but at least
we're getting a fairly large number that
says we might be using all the buckets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
