so I'm Ashwin drama I'm gonna talk with
you a little bit today about
conversation leh I you you've probably
all seen quotes like this the age of
touches at the end something news on
this on the horizon a Sarah Sarah if you
look at where we've come in the computer
land for decades we've been typing at
our computers that's the primary mode of
interacting with a computer for the last
10 or so years we've been touching and
swiping with the advent of the
smartphone and slowly that is now
permeated to other kinds of technology
not just phones about two years ago with
the advent of Alexa voice became voice
became a game changer and of course
there was voice interfaces before that
well let's have did something and I what
what I want to do with you today is
share with you what we did and what the
game changer has been so the vision
behind Alexa is is really this that when
we communicate with technology nowadays
we have to learn the technology we learn
user interfaces we pass buttons and
dials and all of that stuff but why
don't we have machines learn about us
instead of the other way around so if
I'm talking to you if I want to
communicate with you I'm not typing at
you I'm not touching and swiping and
turning dials I'm just talking let's do
that with our machines as well so that's
what Alexa comes in right in fact I
brought the Alexa with me I'll have a
assuming the Wi-Fi works in here let's
have our introduce herself
Alexa introduce yourself I'm Alexa and
I'm designed around your voice I can
provide information music news weather
and more so that's the LexA she comes in
this form factor she also comes in an
echo the little things you've seen
recently the dots on tablets on your
television and I'll show you
increasingly other kinds of devices the
magic that made Alexa
it was this far-field voice recognition
technology so Alexis it's in your house
it's not in your phone right it's not in
your computer it's just sitting out
there in your house and you talk to it
naturally across the room like you would
talk to any person and there might be
other people in the room there's music
playing your maybe your ovens going off
or there's conversations going around it
doesn't matter LexA picks up your voice
and talks with you and that's the
far-field technology that we invented
what does Alexa do pretty much about
everything initially there was a lot of
emphasis on music and shopping as you
would expect from Amazon so Alexa will
play music not just from Amazon from
Pandora Spotify tune in really whatever
you like elect a lot of people use Alexa
for household organization shopping this
timers alarms calendars those kinds of
things LexA gives you information news
weather you can ask it any question
pretty much and she will have an answer
for you a lot of usage around smart
homes Alexa will control your lights
lock your front door closed a garage
those kinds of things in fact there are
over 10,000 skills developed by third
parties you can Alexa will get you pizza
play games with you like jeopardy and
and others check your bank account and
get you coffee and a whole lot of other
things in fact these are some of the
popular skills we have you can get
flowers for Mother's Day you can get a
ride from uber Alexa get me an uber and
the uber shows up no more swiping
touching working with apps anymore right
so that's the vision behind Alexa
locking doors and so forth so the way
this is made possible is through a
service we call the Alexa skill scape so
Alexa lives in the cloud and you
interact with Alexa through voice your
interactions then get routed to these
skills that then fulfill the request and
I'll show you how that works
in a few minutes so if you want to add a
capability your dominoes you want to add
Pizza ordering capability you build a
skill for Alexa you plug it in and now
millions of Alexa customers
automatically have Pizza ordering
capability we also have another service
called the Alexa voice service that lets
you embed Alexa in other devices so of
course you can get Alexa in
things like this that Amazon makes but
you can also get a LexA in watches in
your car in video communicators that's
the bottom right it's made by a company
called nucleus in the middle there
there's a kitchen appliance a kitchen
device that Alexa enabled so Alexa can
actually live insight other devices as
well and that CES this year there were
dozens of devices like this announcer
Samsung's gonna have Alexa enable
fridges
you can ask your friend if it's if
you're out of milk and the fridge will
talk back with you so the idea is that
any device can become an endpoint for
lxl and and all these other kinds of
examples DISH Network another very big
announcement so we are running out of
space for all of the partners that are
incorporating or have incorporated Alexa
right and so if you look at what people
are doing with Alexa a lot of you know
the kinds of applications I showed you
earlier my favorite is actually the top
right most Alexa devices are used by
multiple people this is really the first
computer for years that is not a
personal computer it's a computer in
your house it's a it's a part it's a
friend it's a member of your family
you talk to talk to her so this is where
AI comes in right so we have this huge
opportunity for I imagine millions of
people interacting with dozens of Alexa
endpoints interacting with tens of
thousands or capabilities it's a
mind-boggling number of different use
cases and types of conversation
interactions everything has to be done
through voice and through natural human
conversation right so let's talk about
why this is hard right language
understanding is the hardest problem we
know we have we have self-driving cars
we have all kinds of fancy AI out there
in the world we don't have a computer
that can speak like a five-year-old can
to each other just normal natural
conversation right so why is language so
hard so let's look at some of the hard
problems that we are solving with the
with the Alexa platform speech
recognition is the most basic one so you
have a Lexus sitting on a house is a
party going on there's music playing
your friends are talking and you say
Alexa Alexa has to understeer voice zoom
in 0n and pick up your speed sound and
cancel
thing else hard problems there okay and
now we have to figure out what the
request is so Alexa you in a party Alexa
play some pink what does that mean play
pink right you're trying to play a piece
of music by a band called capital P
exclamation point NK and X has to figure
that out and play it for you and and get
get to get that thing right harder
problems let's try this one
Alexa who was the US president when
Obama was a teenager anyone know the
answer
Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford were the u.s. presidents
when Barack Obama so we have to do
infants to answer these questions there
is not a Wikipedia page you can look up
which will tell you the four presidents
during Obama's teenage years
why it's a lot of understanding has to
be done to understand what you mean and
then construct an answer for you why did
you say it if you say Alexa is it hot
outside right the answer is no but
that's probably not what you intended
what you really meant was what's the
weather like so your intent was to ask
about the weather but you didn't ask
about the weather
and so we have to figure out what's in
your head when you're asking that
question and then give you the right
answer which is something like it's now
42 or whatever it is outside in Mountain
View so that's basic speech interfaces
when you start getting into conversation
I guess even harder right so let's talk
about some of the challenges with with
conversation Alexa I want to see a movie
now let's has to talk back with you
what's the right response here right
turn on Netflix on your television find
your movies nearby playing at the
theater ask you what kind of genre movie
you want to see ask you who you're
watching a movie with so I can recommend
something appropriate there's a whole
conversation you can have around that so
figuring out sort of why you're telling
me this why you stating this is a hard
problem we do it naturally with each
other all the time
context model modeling right what do we
both already know as in the context that
we can refer to to save time I won't go
through this at this exercise you can
try it
so who's Barack Obama Barack Obama is
the whatever right who's his wife well
where was she
when was she born she's a hard problem
here right figuring out who she refers
to because the user has never mentioned
mentioned Michelle Obama and yet it's
Alexa knows that you know that we are
talking about Michelle and so it's in
the ship what we call the shared context
of the conversation so we have to
maintain context and unpack that context
as we go along right when was he born
now we're back to Barack again so here's
another contextual problem Alexa what's
40 to anyone knows Oh integrity to is
the answer to life the universe and
everything the trick is knowing what the
question so this this makes sense
because we have a lot of shared context
cultural context not dialogue context
anymore shared knowledge and you know
that we can riff off of when we talk
with each other and we'd like a lecture
to do the same thing and this question
may not make sense if you're from
different cultures and we don't have
that shared understanding right response
generation Alexa I'm bored right this is
this is one of the hardest problems what
is the right thing to say here right so
we tackle all of these kinds of problems
on an Alexa to give these millions of
people on these dozens of devices that
magical experience of just speaking with
Alexa just like with another human being
that's the ultimate goal okay so here's
how Alexa works so we say for example
Alexa is that hot outside
we the device is doing only one thing
which is listening for her name not
doing any audio processing no streaming
so we call that wakeboard detection
that's that sort of figuring out on the
device that you're speaking to Alexa
after that your voice gets sent up to
the cloud and it goes through speech
recognition to figure out what the words
are that you uttered based on the sound
waves that came up so in this case it is
is it hot outside we then go through
natural language understanding to figure
out your intent in this case it's the
weather intent we go through some
processing to figure out the rest of the
intent you didn't ask well I didn't you
I didn't tell you where I wanted the
weather maybe it's where I'm sitting
right now maybe it's what I just said in
my previous story I have to figure that
out and then finally I get an answer
and that gets spoken out in speech and
if this were a longer talk I would show
you some of the technologies behind each
of these boxes the folks here in the AI
nanodegree at Udacity which is
absolutely marvelous you'll be learning
to build every one of these boxes
yourself hands-on in the next six months
or so which is it okay so I'll just
conclude with of how you use Alexa I
mentioned the skills kit if you're a
software developer and you want to add
capability voice services if you're
Hardware maker and you want your device
to be voice enabled we also have the
Alexa fund for startups if you had
interesting ideas with voice nucleus The
Voice communicator was a startup that we
funded through the Alexa fund and then
final slide we have the Amazon Alexa
prize for students this is the two and a
half million dollar competition to build
a skillful AXA that can converse
engagingly and naturally with you about
daily topics like politics sports
entertainment etcetera there's a million
dollar challenge prize if you can engage
users for 20 minutes and we have 18
teams from these colleges competing in
it right now
in about a month these companies skills
will be available for all of you to try
luck for you to try them give this
team's feedback and help them improve
okay so that's my that's the end so
since we do have some students here let
me take five seconds to give you a piece
of advice if you do want to contact me
don't send me a generic one click
LinkedIn or to anybody else you want to
contact we get dozens of those take the
trouble to write a short introduction so
I know who you are and I'd be happy to
talk with you thanks very much for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
