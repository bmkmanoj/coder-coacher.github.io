models very simply is how does your
company make money so in her last
lectures we talked about value
proposition customer segments
distribution channels customer
relationships get keeping and growing
customers but today we're going to be
talking about revenue streams how is it
that you make money now revenue models
that seems incredibly simple it answers
the question how does the company make
money from each customer segment but one
of the things that we always tend to
confuse is the difference between a
revenue model and pricing that is the
amount of dollars that we might actually
charge for the product and this is a
common mistake but we're really trying
to understand first is what value is the
customer paying for and the first thing
we need to figure out is what is our
revenue model what's the revenue stream
that's our strategy but what follows is
then pricing what is our tactics so
again what we're going to try to figure
out is what's our strategy revenue
streams and what's our tactics pricing
and together that means how do I there's
a company make money from each customer
segment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
