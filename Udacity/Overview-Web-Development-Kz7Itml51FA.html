of a grab bag of things I didn't get to
cover in this class in lectures up until
now basically going to be you know
real-world issues and some decisions you
know what I look for in a web framework
how we host our stuff things like that
and some of the decision making process
and we're gonna also spend a lot of time
talking about reddit how we grew it to
the extent that we can explain that and
how we you know grew the architecture
and we'll also do a couple interviews
one with my friend Neil who is the lead
engineer at reddit now another one with
Udacity the engineers at Udacity who
will explain how they use App Engine in
the real world you know I've only used
App Engine really in the context of
teaching this course and built a number
of small toy websites now but these guys
can actually talk about what it's like
to use App Engine in production on a
site with thousands of users
there will be no quizzes this is just
for you to sit back and and watch if
these things don't interest you just
skip ahead to the homework if these
things do interest you you know welcome
it should be fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
