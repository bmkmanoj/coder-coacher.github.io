title we're going to use a string for
the art we're also going to use a string
and for the created we're also going to
we're going to use a date/time now
actually I lied to you we're not going
to use a string we're going to use
something called text but there's no way
for me to ask a quiz without giving away
the answer I learned while writing this
that there is another type called text
and the difference between a string and
a text is that a string must be under
500 characters and can be indexed text
can be greater than 500 characters which
is really handy for ASCII art ASCII art
that is under 500 characters is not very
fun at all I actually learned this while
building this lesson and text cannot be
indexed which means of course that we
can't sort based on a text property this
is fine you know in our case we're gonna
sort probably on the created property so
it can show things in order we won't be
able to sort things by the the artwork
which is fine because what would that
even mean so if we reuse the string data
type which we're gonna use on our titles
yeah it's indexed so you can you can do
queries you can say get me the art where
a type title equals x you can't we can't
do a query get me their text equals x
because it's not indexed anyway
let's let's go ahead and define our data
type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
