directly into our function calls like
for our weather interpreter function
whose definition is here we've passed in
different integer arguments for the
temperature like 4 and 32 and for these
function calls we'll see this print
output BRR consider wearing a jacket for
an argument of 4 degrees Celsius and
it's hot outside for 32 degrees but
instead of directly passing in these
values we can also pass in variables as
arguments as long as they're the right
type so for our weather example that
would look something like this our
weather interpreter still expects an
integer as an argument but instead of
typing in a value directly like 32 we're
passing in the int variable degrees C
that's spent declared and initialized
here and this variable holds the value
32 so this function call will print out
it's hot outside just like before and if
we change the value of degrees C to say
15 and use the same weather interpreter
call this will prompt the code in our
function definition to run and we'll go
through our if tests this time with
temperature equal to 15 for a
temperature value of 15 we don't pass
our first hot test because 15 is not
greater than 30 we also don't pass our
second test because 15 is not less than
5 we end up in our else block of code
and print out not too hot not too cold
this way we haven't changed our function
call at all we're still saying whether
interpreter with degrees C passed in
we've just changed the value of our
variable to be 15 and it's often a lot
easier to change variables rather than
change whole function calls so passing
in variables as arguments is really
useful and as long as we're passing in
an int value directly or as a variable
which is the type of input or whether
interpreter expects our code will run
and this goes for any function that
expects input as long as we're passing
in the type of variable our function
expects as a variable like degrees C or
as a direct value like 32 our function
call will work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
