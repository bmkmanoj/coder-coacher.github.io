way we are doing this RPC between the
client and the server using the actual
call copies through the colonel is
completely eliminated right it's
completely eliminated because all of the
argument result passing between the
client of the server is happening
through this a stack which is mapped
into the address space of the client and
the server and so the actual overheads
that are incurred in making this RPC
call is this client trap and validation
by the kernel that this call can be
allowed to go through and switching the
domains I told you about this trick of
doctoring the client threat to start
executing in the server procedure that
is really switching the protection
domain from the client address space
into the server address space so that
you can start executing the procedure
that's visible only in this address
space so that is the switching domain in
the second overhead and finally when the
server procedure is done executing the
return trap that's the third explicit
costs so three explicit costs associated
with the actual call the first explicit
cost is the client trap and validating
this Bo and the second explicit cost is
switching this protection domain from
the client to the server so that we can
start executing the server procedure and
the third explicit cost is when we have
this return trap to go back to the
client address space so those are the
explicit costs but we know having done a
lot of work on the operating system
structures early on that there are
implicit overheads that are associated
with switching protection domains the
implicit overhead is the loss of
locality due to the domain switching
that's happening when we go from the
client address space to the server
address space we are touching of course
we are touching some part of the address
space are going to be in physical memory
and therefore in the caches of the
processor but there's a lot of stuff
that may not be in the caches of the
processor so there is going to be a loss
of locality your the domain switch that
that may happen and in the sense that
the caches in the processor
may not have all the stuff that the
server needs in order to do its
execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
