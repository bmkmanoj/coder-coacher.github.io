connect the code that we've written thus
far to an image we saw previously in the
course here we try to divide the
different parts of our app into three
camps I also want to investigate our
code and find out why is this
programming file called view controller
what do those words view and controller
even mean the place where this
conversation starts is with an acronym
m-v-c or Model View and controller and
what this is is a way to design or make
software applications like the app that
we are making let's begin with what is a
view simply put a view is what the user
sees or what is really visual on the
screen so in our case that would be
buttons like the microphone button and
labels like the recording in progress
label if you look at the document
outline you will notice that the
microphone button the recording in
progress label the stop button they all
form a part of our view to highlight the
view on our screen I can change its
background color I can simply slide out
the utility area and change the
background color boom done
then let's think about the model this
refers to the data of our app now we do
not have one explicitly defined just yet
but when we record our audio in Lesson
four
that audio file including the name of
the file the date it was recorded that
will all become a part of our model and
finally let's talk about the controller
our controller as its name suggests
controls conversations between the model
and the view in our case that is the
viewcontroller.swift file when a user
presses on a button like the microphone
button the controller handles that using
an action also when a controller wants
to change something interview like show
and hide this recording and progress
label it uses an outlet now a valid
question to ask at this point is why do
all of this well the most important
advantage is that we can separate the
major components of our app this helps
in building large apps and in making
changes to them at a later
staged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
