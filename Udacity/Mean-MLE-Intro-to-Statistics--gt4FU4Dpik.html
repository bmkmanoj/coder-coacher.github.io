recording studio and as always this is
entirely optional this goes way beyond
what would ever be taught in
introductory statistics class so it's
only for those who love hard proof
challenges and as previously we're going
to prove the correctness of the maximum
likelihood estimator Emily but this time
for gaussians so our exercise cannot be
arbitrary values not just zeros or ones
and the mean and the variance are
computed using these two now familiar
formula so how can we prove this to be
correct again last chance to skip so as
before there's the proof on the left
side with a couple of blanks five in
total and there's seven expressions they
can put in and the way you put them in
is if for example the seventh expression
and your opinion fits over here you put
the number seven in here you only use
either expression on the right side once
and there's obviously more expressions
on the right side and their holes on the
left side let me quickly go over the
proof in maximizing the probability of
the data we first state the probability
of these two idioms and this one over
here using a normal distribution with
parameters mu and Sigma square but I
left something unknown on the left that
you have to pick from the right side
then we take the logarithm of this and
here's the logarithm with two gaps
inside if we take the first derivative
of the logarithm that you have to
compute by picking the appropriate term
on the right and set it to zero averages
where the maximum is attained from that
we can transform the expression to this
expression over here we're left out a
term and that finally gives you the
desired proof for the Maxima like the
estimator for the mean good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
