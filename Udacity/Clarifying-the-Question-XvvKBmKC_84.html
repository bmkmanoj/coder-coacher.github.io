it's a pleasure to be here let's get
started so given a 2d matrix M of just
zeros and ones to count the number of
islands in the matrix in this case an
island is just a group of once or one by
itself ok so we're given a 2d matrix
which would look something like this
so what were to do is we're to find the
number of islands where an island is a
group of once connected but if ones are
connected diagonally does that
constitute an island know the ones need
to be connected either horizontally or
vertically to count as an island ok so
we're really supposed to do is find the
number of violence in this matrix where
an island is once connected horizontally
and vertically that's exactly right cool
all right how do you think our interview
we did for the first portion of the
interview well I think he didn't do too
bad he clarified the question to make
sure that he's solving the right problem
right this is a very popular interview
question so there are different
variations it's important to make sure
you're solving the right variation some
interviewers may consider once connected
diagonally to be an island in general
clarifying a problem is crucial to being
a good software developer you need to
prove to your interviewer that you won't
dive headfirst into a problem and
potentially waste time writing code that
doesn't solve the initial issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
