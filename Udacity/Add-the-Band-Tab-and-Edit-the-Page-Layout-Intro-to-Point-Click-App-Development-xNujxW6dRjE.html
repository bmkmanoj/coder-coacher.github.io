we've got bands which look up to stages
yep just look up to festivals and then
we got our attendees hanging out looking
up to festivals it's all looking good
maybe we should add a couple band
records
yeah it's make some music happen let's
do it okay so go to setup and we don't
have any band to have up here what am I
gonna do Sam yeah so one of the
trade-offs of building and schema
builder is it doesn't have that little
checkbox to automatically create a new
tab and so we're gonna have to do that
ourselves by manually getting there in
the setup but the side bar on the left
is kind of overwhelming there's a lot of
stuff you can click into but you can use
the quick fine which is that little
search bar on the top over there
and if you know what you're looking for
like for example creating a tab you can
just type tab and it filters it for you
okay so a quick create tabs sounds good
then I'm guessing new here yep so we've
been through this drill before yeah this
is my favourite decision to make okay so
what do you think what should the band
tab look like um music no that sounds
good okay and I'm gonna hit next a bunch
of times I'm sure default visibility on
it sounds good okay I don't want it to
be available to all these silly default
apps right just the festival app okay
cool okay we've got bands up here so now
I can add a record mm okay now I had a
band and I'll has his name so that's the
other trade-off with building and schema
builder it's not automatically added to
the page layout what is it like the few
all in the fields that we created yeah
so let's just create a band so just pick
any random name that you want or I guess
not random pick a band you want to play
at our festival okay um I don't know who
do you like change slightly for
copyright purposes let's do you three my
favorite band so we've got our band u3
and it doesn't have the fields like
genre and all that but we can add them I
hope so
if we ever wanted to modify the page
layout like adding fields or even moving
fields around taking them off whatever
you want to do you can either do that
from the object setup detail page and
set up or easily from the page
here in the top right hand corner where
it says edit layout so those are my
fields I want them genre headliner there
you go right now we're looking at the
page layout editor and setup and we have
all of our fields or if we made custom
buttons or maybe had other lists that we
wanted to show we could drag all of
those into the page layout so why don't
you grab a couple of your fields and
then put them onto the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
