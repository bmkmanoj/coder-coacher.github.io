receiving this so it better be something
encrypted with a key that our four can
decrypt our force should not be able to
decrypt something encrypted with the
public key of Alice our four could
decrypt these two because our four could
know the public key of Bob but then
anyone could also decrypt these two so
we want it encrypted in a way that only
our four can open that's like the
envelope with the seal that only a
particular person should be able to open
the content needs to be visible to our
for where to send the message next which
is what the to Alice part does but
invisible to our for what the actual
content is Alice looks different from
the other routers the way I'm writing it
here for this to be secure there
shouldn't be any real distinction
between our foreign Dallas that's hard
to get in a network like this so it
probably is the case that our four
actually learns that Alice's the end
point but because the message was
received from the previous one in this
chain doesn't learn that it was Bob
talking with Alice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
