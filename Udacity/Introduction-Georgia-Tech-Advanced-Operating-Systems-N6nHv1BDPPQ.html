ordering mechanism for events in a
distributed system this theoretical
basis is all the more important in this
day and age when so many everyday
services email social networks ecommerce
and now even online education are
becoming distributed incidentally there
is the same Lamport who gave us a way to
order memory accesses in a shared memory
multiprocessors through the sequential
consistency memory model in the next
part of the lesson we turn our attention
to more practical matters in distributed
systems specifically given that network
communication is the key to performance
for distributed services the operating
system has to strive hard to reduce the
latency incurred in the system software
for network services lamport's clock
serves at the theoretical underpinning
for achieving deterministic execution in
a distributed system despite the non
determinism that exists due to the
vagaries of the network in this lesson
we will discuss techniques for making
the operating system software stack
efficient for Network communication both
by looking at application interface to
the kernel as well as inside the colonel
in the protocol stack itself but first a
quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
