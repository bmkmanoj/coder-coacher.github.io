put all of the parent polynomial
functions that we talked about so far
and they're grouped according to which
ones he said had similar end behavior or
in other words similar behavior at
either tail of the graph moving away
from the origin however I have added one
extra graph we didn't talk about in this
section explicitly and that's the graph
of y equals x remember that technically
the variable X is a polynomial it's just
a polynomial of first-degree pretty
simple I know that it looks pretty
different from both X cubed in X to the
fifth but I do have a reason for putting
it over here you'll see in a second
first of all though the similar behavior
of graphs over here and of graphs over
here has led these groups of functions
to have names all the functions on one
of these two graphs are even functions
and the other set are odd functions so
which one do you think is which I've
labeled this set of graphs a and this
set of graphs be just use your common
sense to answer this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
