is very good and you would have come up
with the right answers for all of these
entries let me just quickly summarize
what I'm sure that most of you have
gotten already in all cases except this
where the global part of the faulting
node peace cache is empty the local part
of course is going to go up by one the
global part is going to come down by one
only when the global part is empty
already there's no change and in both
cases there's no change to the balance
between LNG on both the node queue which
is supplying the page X and the node R
that happens to have the LRU page
because it is not even part of the
action in terms of the page fault
handling for these two cases the third
case is where it is on the disk and
therefore this is immaterial right
because it's not in any cluster memory
right now it is on the disk so it's not
applicable so the question is what
happens to the guy that has the globally
oldest page if it is on the disk and we
are to bring it into the faulting node
then necessarily we have to make space
in the cluster memory as a whole for
this extra page because this guy's
balance is going to shift and I have to
throw this global page somewhere I'm
picking this guy as a replacement
candidate because he has the globally
oldest page but what is gonna happen on
this node well it really depends on
whether the LRU page comes from the
global part or the local part if it
comes from the global part then there is
no change on our because you're
basically throwing this into the global
part and he is throwing one of those
global pages out onto the disk right if
on the other hand the global page that I
sent over here results in replacing a
local page on node R because the local
page happens to be the LRU candidate
then L goes down by one and G goes up by
one so we are able to do more community
service in this case and in the last
case when it is actively shared again
even
we find the missing page in node Q
there's no change in the balance of Alan
G because it is coming from the active
part of L because it is shared it
indicates if it is shared it has to be
from the L part of Q since it is
actively shared there's no change in the
split between L and G and of course this
guy has to send one of its global pages
to some other node because the memory
pressure as a whole is increasing on
node P this guy is gonna send it to node
or that has the LRU page and just like
in this case where I have to make room
for the cumulative memory pressure on
the cluster by throwing out a page under
the disk and similar to this case if the
candidate replacement page comes from
the local part of our then it is going
to result in the local part shrinking by
one and the global part increasing by
one to accommodate the page that came
from here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
