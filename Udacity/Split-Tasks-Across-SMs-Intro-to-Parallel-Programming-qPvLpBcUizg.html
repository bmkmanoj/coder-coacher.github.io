that allows us to have many SMS working
on a single merge our strategy here is
going to be to try to break up this one
huge merge task that we need to do and
to a bunch of smaller merges each of
which can then be processed
independently and in parallel by a
different SM so the algorithm for doing
this is pretty cool the goal is that
when we're breaking up these two long
lists this blue list in this green list
into shorter sub lists and then merging
the results that we don't have any sub
tasks that are too big to do on one SM
it's okay for us to have some smaller
and some bigger sub tasks but we don't
want a sub task that's too big for one
SM so here's what we're going to do we
have a big long list with tons of
elements in it and that's too big for us
to be able to deal with so what we're
going to do instead is take a subset of
each of these lists in fact what we're
going to do is take every nth element of
each of these lists let's say every 250
6th element so we're going to create
much shorter lists now and so we're
going to call these elements that we
select splitters they're 256 elements
apart and our list here is going to be
ABCD and so on and our list here is
going to be e F G H and so on so then
what we're gonna do is we're gonna merge
these splitters to get a single sorted
list say EAB FC g d h now just as with
the merge algorithm we defined a few
minutes ago we calculate the position of
each splitter in the other list so it's
very straightforward of for us to use
the merge algorithm we already know to
merge these two small lists of splitters
note that the sorted splitter list
already tells us in which sub list our
splitter will appear so just as before
we can do binary search for the exact
position now here's the cool bit what I
will submit to you is that we now have a
sorted list of splitters and the
elements that fall between any two
splitters in this list are an
independent set that we can send to an
SM and independently sort so the
elements between E and a can go to one
SM the elements between a and B can go
to another SM and so on so let's look at
this in a little bit more detail with
the elements between F and C we can
calculate the position of F in C's list
we can calculate the position of C
and F's list and so the work that we
need to do for the pair defined by F and
C is to merge this list with this list
and one of our goals was to make sure
that none of these sub lists would be
too big and we can guarantee that
because we know that there are no more
than 256 elements between F and G and we
know there are no more than 256 elements
between B and C so we can guarantee that
there are no more than 512 elements
between F and C and so by choosing the
spacing between the splitters we can
guarantee a maximum size on any of the
independent chunks that we need to
independently merge in the last stage of
this algorithm so the challenge we've
addressed here we take one big problem
and divide it into a large number of
small problems each of which can be
processed in parallel so to sum up what
we just did we looked at three different
phases of a merge sort each of which we
attack with a different strategy first
we used one thread block to solve many
merging problems in parallel here the
number of problems was much much greater
than the number of SMS then we used one
thread block to solve one larger merging
problem here the number of problems was
on par with the number of SMS finally we
cooperated between all thread blocks to
solve a single problem now we have fewer
problems than SMS so to keep all the
hardware busy we needed to find a way to
divide the single problem into multiple
independent problems so that we could
keep all the SMS busy and that concludes
the merge sort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
