investigating HR I what are some of the
cutting edge areas that you see kind of
developing right now so you know I think
the interesting thing that's happening
with robotics right now is a lot of the
core technologies have matured to the
point where we can build real stuff and
so what that means now is we don't have
to think about this as a robotics
industry but is using robotics to film a
lot of other problems and so I think
many students who are interested in
robotics have other areas of interest as
well all right so if you think about
pettalia help at a really high level
we're combining this technology robotics
and AI with the healthcare domain and a
specific set of problems within there
and I think we're starting to see a lot
of those intersections and the very
interesting companies that we're seeing
come out that leverage robotics is the
technology are the ones not trying to
build a robot platform but the ones who
are trying to solve particular problems
and so in some senses it's a very vague
answer right I'm not saying you know
this area or that area but in some sense
it's very concrete in that the
interesting stuff that we're going to
see over the next few years and the
successful robotics companies are the
ones who are solving very
domain-specific problems leveraging
robotics technology and we're starting
to see that pop up in a lot of different
areas right my edges for a long time has
been in health care so I'm most familiar
with what's going on there but we're
seeing this across healthcare there's a
ton of these companies in education
there's a lot like entertainment and
play and you know with kids and so many
different applications of robotics but
it's where those companies and those
people are really focused on solving a
particular problem as opposed to just
advancing technology for technology's
sake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
