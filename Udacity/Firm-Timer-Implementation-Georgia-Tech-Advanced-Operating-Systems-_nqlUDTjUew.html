tasks to signify a scheduled level
entity and so using t1 t2 t3 to mean
tasks which are scheduled level entities
and the timer queue data structure what
it contains is the tasks and the expiry
time for that particular task and the
tasks are ordered in this timer queue
data structure maintained by the kernel
sorted by the expiry time so task t1 is
the earliest tasks to go off because it
is the earliest expiry time t2 is next
with an expiry time of 12 t3 was an
expiry time of 15 and so on so this is
the way the kernel is maintaining the
data structure to know when a particular
tasks expiry time is up for processing
the event associated with that
particular task the basis for firm timer
implementation is the availability of a
peak Hardware epoch is advanced
programmable interrupt controller which
is implemented on chip in modern CPU
starting from Intel Pentium onwards and
the firm timer implementation and TS
Linux takes advantage of the epoch
Hardware the good news is with the epic
timer Hardware reprogramming a one-shot
timer takes only a few cycles so there
is not a significant overhead to
reprogramming a one-shot timer on modern
CPUs because of the availability of the
epoch Hardware so the task that is have
the head of the queue that had its timer
event go off if it has to be
reprogrammed all that we need to do is
execute a few instructions in modern
processors to reprogram that one-shot
timer to go off at the next one shot
interval when the a peak timer expires
the interrupt handler will go through
this timer queue data structures and
look for tasks whose timers are expired
some of these tasks may be periodic
tasks some of these tasks may have been
programmed to
deal with the epic timer event so
associated with each entry in this timer
queue data structure is the callback
handler for dealing with that particular
event and those callback handlers are
going to be called by the interrupt
handler upon the expiry of the epic
timer the expired timers are going to be
removed from those timer queue data
structures if the entry corresponds to a
periodic timer then the handler will
rienne to that particular task in the
timer queue data structure after
updating its expiry field for the next
periodic event for the task if it is a
one-shot timer that this task was using
in that case the interrupt handler will
reprogram that task for the next one
shard event the way the a peak time of
hardware works is by setting a value
into a register which is decremented at
each memory bus cycle until it reaches 0
at which point it will generate an
interrupt
now given a hundred megahertz memory bus
for instance on modern CPUs a one-shot
timer has a theoretical accuracy of 10
nanoseconds however in practice the time
needed to feel the timer interrupt is
significantly higher and that becomes a
limiting factor in the granularity that
you can get with one-shot timers
implemented using the epoch Hardware but
the important point is that epoch
Hardware allows you to implement very
fine-grained timers in modern processes
and as I already mentioned by choosing
an appropriate overshoot parameter in
reprogramming the epoch timer we can
eliminate the need for fielding one-shot
interrupts because of soft timers going
off within that overshoot period another
optimization that we can do in the firm
timer implementation is looking at the
distance between one-shot events for
instance in this picture I'm showing you
the long
distance between two one-shot events
there is a one-shot event happening here
there's a one-shot timer event happening
here another one-shot timer event
happening here
and if you have such a long distance it
is possible that there may be several
periodic timer events that may be going
off within this long distance so this
suggests that if periodic events are
going to go off and if it is close
enough to a one-shot timer that would
have gone off why not take advantage of
that so what we want to do is dispatch
a one-shot event at a preceding periodic
event the key thing for time sensitivity
is not missing at the timer event if
you're gonna process it a little bit
sooner that's okay so that's exactly
what is happening here just as in the
case of the overshoot parameter being
used in combining one shot with a soft
timer what we are doing here is because
periodic timers are going to interrupt
anyhow and if the kernel notices that
there is a one-shot event that is coming
up fairly soon then it can simply
dispatch that one shot event at the
preceeding periodic timer event that is
anyhow interrupting the processor and
once you do that then you can reprogram
this one shot event to go off at the
next expiry point for that one shot
event so basically what we are doing
when we have a long distance between
one-shot events is to use a preceding
periodic timer event so that we can both
avoid the overhead of dealing with this
one-shot event and also the cost of
reprogramming it or in other words we
completely eliminate using one-shot
events for situations where the distance
between the one-shot events is so big
that we can simply use the periodic
event instead of the one-shot event and
the reasons for doing that are twofold
one is periodic even data structures are
much more efficient in the kernel they
are order of one data structures
whereas the one-shot event programming
data structures and the kernel tends to
be order of log n where n is the number
of active timers so as an optimization
if the one-shot events happen at fairly
long distances that there are several
periodic events that are going to happen
anyhow within that we will simply use
the periodic timers instead of the
one-shot timer so to summarize the firm
timer implementation the first point is
that the epoch Hardware allows
reprogramming one-shot timers in few
cycles and secondly by choosing the
appropriate overshoot distance we can
eliminate the need for fielding the
one-shot timer interrupts if soft timers
go off within that overshoot period and
third if the distance between one-shot
timers is really long then instead of
using one-shot timers we will simply use
periodic timers and dispatch the
one-shot event at the preceding periodic
timer event those are the ideas that are
enshrined in the firm timer
implementation in TS Linux that
essentially combines the advantages of
one-shot timer with soft timers with
periodic timers so this should give you
a feel for how TS Linux by a clever
implementation reduces the timer latency
the first component of the latency from
the point of event happening the event
activation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
