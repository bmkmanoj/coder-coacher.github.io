intelligence called the Cattell horn
Karel theory of intelligence this is the
best known compromise between the
singular intelligence theory and the
multiple intelligences theory this
theory focuses on the idea that
intelligence comes in two distinct forms
fluid and crystallized intelligence now
if you remember from lesson 5 on
development fluid intelligence is the
raw intelligence this is the processing
power and it's relatively free from
culture and environmental influences
crystallized intelligence on the other
hand reflects what you learn from your
environment and your experiences let's
look at the Cattell horn Karel theory as
a hierarchy it focuses on three broad
levels the first level is the general
intelligence or the g-factor
the second level is the broad level of
intelligence these are your general
abilities this is where your
crystallized intelligence and your fluid
intelligence comes into play as well as
things like your general memory or your
processing speed now there's other
abilities that go on this level but
these are the main four and finally the
last level is a narrow level this
consists of specific forms of cognitive
abilities from each of the broader
domains for example with crystallized
intelligence it would be things like
reading spelling or language
comprehension and for fluid intelligence
it would be things like speed of
reasoning or facial reasoning the main
idea here is that intelligence would be
a hierarchy we start with the general
idea of intelligence the g-factor
or 2/1 intelligence and then we go to a
more broad level this includes abilities
such as crystallized and fluid
intelligence or memory and processing
speed among others and then finally from
there it narrows down into specific
abilities for each one of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
