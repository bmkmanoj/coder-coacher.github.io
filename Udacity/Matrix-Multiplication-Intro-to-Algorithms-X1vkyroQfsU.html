with matrix multiplication there's a
very nice connection between this little
algorithm that we were just working on
and matrix multiplication so the first
thing to appreciate that the first thing
you need to understand is that if we can
represent a graph on a set of nodes as a
matrix and it's a matrix since that's
consists of all zeros and ones and if
it's a sparse graph say mostly zeros but
if there's a link between node I and
node J then the corresponding position
in the matrix has a number in it number
one all right so that one there means
that there's a link from I to J now the
graphs that we've been talking about
links are bi-directional so if there's a
1 in this I J position then there's also
a 1 in the ji position which in this
picture seems like would be really
nearby which means that this matrix is
symmetric and I'm not going to get into
a matrix terminology but again if you're
familiar with it you'll recognize what a
symmetric matrix is the matrix equals
its own transpose if we flip things the
other way she's basically natural it
means we're just change interchanging
the nodes
since the connections are bi-directional
will have the same matrix again so let's
call this matrix M and let's think about
what it means to multiply M times itself
in matrix multiplication the way we fill
in the IJ entry of the product so we
take the I throw of the first matrix and
the J column of the second Matrix and I
always always need two hands whenever I
think about matrix multiplication and
you go across this one and down this one
at the same time and what we do in this
case it's since it's all zeros and ones
and it's a square matrix but we're going
to go through and figure out anywhere
where there's a zero and one and a zero
on the other it's going to be zero only
if there's a one in both is it going to
be a product that's not zero so this
multiplication of this row times this
column is exactly a count of the number
of ones that the two vectors have in
exactly the same positions now what does
it mean for them to have a 1 in the same
position let's check to Majan that
there's a 1 in position K here and at
the same time in position K here this
position here means that our graph has a
link from I to K right that's what this
means if there's a 1 there and similarly
if there's a 1 in this position it means
that very same graph that we're talking
about this graph that M is representing
also has a link from k to J and what
we're doing is counting up all the K's
that have the property that they would
take
you can get from I to one of those and
then 2j from one of those so it's going
to add all those up that's exactly what
matrix multiplication does so this value
here is going to be filled in with
precisely the number of two-step path
from I to J which is exactly what we
needed in that other example that we're
basically counting up the comic books
that are in common between some
character I and some character J so in
the case of the bipartite graph of the
Marvel comic book characters any
two-step path that starts at a character
goes through a comic book and then a
character so this is counting up exactly
the number of comic books that I and J
are both in so there we go the square of
the matrix which represents the
connections of the graph actually gives
us the same answer the running time of
this algorithm of course is in cubed
because we're looping through for each
of the entries of this matrix that we're
going to fill in and there's n Square to
them we're doing this row by column
multiplication which also takes time n
so it's in cubed the algorithm that
we've just been talking about something
more like number of edges times the
number of nodes the number of edges here
comes from the fact that we loop over
each of the character book combinations
that we have stored explicitly and then
for each of those we examine which
characters are they're connected to so
it could be as bad as n times M if M is
dense matrix then this is N squared so
this algorithm ends up being in cubed
again but if it's a sparse matrix so the
number of edges is linear like in a
planar graph for example then this is N
squared which is actually a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
