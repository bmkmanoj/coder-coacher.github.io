company it has its own advantages yes
what's your favorite thing that you like
to do for your your job you know it
varies a lot in terms of you know what
I'm doing in a particular day right as
CEO of a small company I do a lot of
different jobs and roles but for me a
lot of the the really fun stuff comes
back to the product that we're building
right so we can build new features not
for the sake of technology but for the
sake of you know benefiting a patient
and actually get those in front of
people and see how they respond to it
right so when I see someone who you know
talks about this thing that we've built
in the way of it you know we've had
patients say I can't live without this
right like that's exciting maybe see
value in this for them and for their
health and you know I love seeing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
