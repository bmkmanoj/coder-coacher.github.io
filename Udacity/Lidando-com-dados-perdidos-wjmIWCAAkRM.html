values in your data and they're
distributed at random what do we do
there are two approaches that I want to
discuss here partial deletion and imp
you ssin partial deletion is exactly
what it sounds like limiting our data
set for analysis to the data that we
have available to us let's discuss
partial deletion further for the
following discussion let's use the Shawn
la min database of baseball players
there are a number of players for whom
any values are missing now let's say
that we wanted to ask a couple of
different questions for example what are
the average lifespan and average height
of baseball players there are many
players that we can't include in the
analysis either because their birthday
or death date is missing or because
they're still alive in this case we may
want to perform partial deletion one
method we could use is called list wise
deletion in the case where we perform
list wise deletion we'd exclude a
particular data point from all analyses
even if some useful values were present
so if using list wise deletion Barry
Bonds who has a listed height but not
death date would not be included in
either analysis even if we were
calculating the average height of
players on the other hand in the case
where we might perform pairwise deletion
we would exclude a particular case from
the analysis for tasks which are not
possible with the data at hand so we
wouldn't include Barry Bonds in our
sample when calculating life span
since there's no death date but we would
still use his height when calculating
the average height of all baseball
players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
