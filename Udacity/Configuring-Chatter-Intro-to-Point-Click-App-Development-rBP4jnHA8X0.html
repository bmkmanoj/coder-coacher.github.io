app going yep we can automate stuff on
the day of the festival problems are
gonna come up and they're gonna get
addressed like that because we've got
all these slick workflows and approvals
going thanks I'm pumped I'm pumped too
but the things we've been working on so
far have mainly been focused on like
what are you gonna be doing or what's
that guy gonna be doing but there's
nothing you know connecting everyone and
getting them to collaborate and do stuff
together mm-hmm like like a team would
okay so I mean think about just first of
all if there were multiple people
working at this stage the Udacity stage
yeah it totally could be how would they
be able to communicate between each
other around things that need to happen
or things that have been happening or
scheduling or whatever email email sucks
right I hate getting a million emails
yeah so what if you could add something
like a Facebook feed to the top of this
record so that people could collaborate
right from this record and it would all
be limited to this screen so they don't
have to check emails save stuff whatever
what if that's what yeah
no it's right yeah okay so I assume we
can do that we can and that's using
chatter okay so what we can do is go
into the setup and add or enable this
object for chatter so I should not just
click on chatter over here no cuz that's
gonna take you to your chatter profile
all right so I'm going to edit this
object what are we doing so you could
edit the object which would remember
that little third checkbox that we
hadn't checked yet yeah that would
enable us to be able to use chatter on
this okay but since we're gonna want to
do a little bit more than just enable it
let's just go into the setup and
configure chatter completely okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
