piece of code for you that i am now
going to demonstrate so the main class
is a class called robot this robot lives
in a two dimensional world of size 100
meters by 100 meters it can see four
different landmarks that are located at
the following coordinates 20 20 80 80 20
80 and 80 20 so here is how we make such
a robot so it's really easy all you have
to do is call a function robot and
assign it to a variable my robot so now
that we can do things with my robot for
example we can set a position these
three values are the x coordinate the y
coordinate and the heading in radians
and this command assigns those values to
the robot let's print these things out
and down here you see the the output x
equals 10 y equals 10 and Heddy an
equals 0 next let's make the robot move
this robot moves 10 meters forward and
doesn't turn so let's print the
resulting position and here we go
you can see that it's now at 20 10 and 0
it moves 10 meters forward from 10 10 to
20 10 now let's make the robot turn by
PI over 2 and move 10 meters so now the
robot is heading in the direction of PI
over 2 and it moved forward 10 meters in
the Y direction instead of the x
direction so as you can tell it's really
easy to program the last thing I want to
show you is how to generate measurements
there is a really easy command called
sense and all it does is give you the
distance to the for landmarks 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
for now this is all you need to know
about the class robot that Sebastian has
programmed for you you might want to
spend some time familiarizing yourself
with the code to see how this is all
configured</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
