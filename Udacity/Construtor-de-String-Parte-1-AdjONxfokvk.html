a string is immutable which means it
can't change once it's been created you
have to create a brand new string object
if you want a slightly different string
on the other hand a string builder is
also a sequence of characters but it is
mutable so it can change after you've
created it now there are pros and cons
of when to use each one but if you're
trying to build up a longer text string
gradually over several steps then a
string builder is a much more efficient
data type because it is mutable
otherwise if you had to create a new
string object at each intermediate step
you'd be wasting memory on the device
and those additional memory allocations
we need to be cleaned up once low string
objects we're no longer used it's much
cleaner to have a single string builder
object and then modify it as needed okay
so let's look at the code for how to use
the string builder class we can declare
and instantiate a new stringbuilder as
usual and then proceed to put the word
world spelled W orld into the Builder
using the append method now the string
builder is currently holding the
sequence of characters that spells world
actually let's make that say word
instead of world by removing the l
character at position 3 when we do this
the Builder now contains the characters
w/o R and D or word then the co depends
more characters onto the string builder
first we add space builder and then
finally a period note that the append
method returns a builder object so
what's neat is that we can actually have
multiple calls to append on a single
line this sequence of multiple method
calls on a single line is known as
method chaining in programmer speak so
as you can see the second time we call a
penned we can add a period when we're
done building we can get a frozen
immutable string by simply calling the
two string method so as we finish we can
see that the string variable bill now
contains the contents word builder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
