that measuring plays inside of a DevOps
organization before devops engineer we
have an objective we have a goal to to
create some efficiency to make some
improvement in the organization from its
own side that aspiration the aspiration
to create the change is not enough so
even if we have the technical capability
to create something better we need to be
able to test and verify that we got the
result we wanted it's very easy to to
make a claim but if we're going to be
pragmatic in our approach we need to
test that claim and this is where
measurement this becomes key we
articulate the objective we articulate
if whatever the steps are we're going to
take to achieve that objective so we
need to underneath the objective we need
to articulate the implementation steps
that we're going to take and then we
have to ask that question how do I
measure it or as measured by so that we
can reflect at the end of this period on
whether the steps that we took actually
achieve the outcome that we wanted this
is really critical when we're talking
about tens of thousands of servers in an
environment the change propositions that
we have can have a broad impact on our
customer base so we need to be able to
clearly measure whether thing we're
doing is actually helping in the way
that we thought it would the way that I
like to think about this is we we make
the value proposition or we talk about
the outcome that we want to achieve we
talk about the implementation steps
we're going to take and then we ask the
question how will we measure whether
those steps got us to this goal and then
when we when we reflect on that we ask
one of three questions was the goal
effective or the implementation steps
effective or is it the measurements that
need to be changed and in this way we
create a kind of a blame free
environment which is really really
critical to fostering a strong develops
culture measurements help us to move the
conversation away from people and onto
the outcomes that we were trying to
achieve it's very very easy to
personalize a result especially in an
environment which we think that we carry
the cause like we're carrying the banner
for the
things so if you come into an
organization and you advocate strongly
to take a particular technical stance
you could feel maybe rightfully so that
your success is tied to the success of
that thing but this can be a very
dangerous place to be because it colors
our perception about the work that we're
doing it's better if we start from the
position that we have strong technical
skills we evaluate the situation we make
a proposal I want F I want to create a
change here for the better I want to
increase test coverage because I believe
that this is going to lower defects and
production and then I'm going to measure
these are the steps i'm going to take to
do it and this is how i'm going to
measure whether it's successful and
that's going to drive a conversation
around one of those three areas as
opposed to a conversation about whether
i was right or wrong about whether the
thing i did was going to have the impact
i said it was going to have first of all
we don't know right i mean let's be
honest there's a lot of variation in
software the best software in the world
got some problems and and it's not
always appropriate in every context so
something that worked at your last job
or something that your friend did at
another place may work perfectly in that
context but it may not work well in the
context that your n and so you need to
be open to taking that feedback to
measuring the results of what you're
doing so that you can find the right fit
your advocacy is not where your value is
going to lie it's in your ability to
assess the results of the thing that you
proposed or the thing that you did
that's where your value is really going
to come through your value as a
developed engineer comes from your
ability to evaluate whether the thing
that you did was successful it is a much
less to do with your ability to identify
a tool in your environment and much more
to do with your ability to make a
proposal execute on it and then reflect
on how successful was that effort did it
hit the mark or did in it that's the
thing that people are going to want from
you you may have all sorts of
interesting opinions and you should
definitely share them about the about
software and about methodology but when
it comes to execution you want to take a
critical data driven
approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
