inventory of the concepts that are going
to be used so so far we have the notion
of a pattern or a regular expression of
a text to match against the result which
will also be a string of some kind and
it doesn't seem like there's all that
many more concepts one thing that it
looks like we'll need is some notion of
a partial result and some notion of
control over the iteration and what do I
mean by that well some of the matches
are easy if we match search for a
literal BEF within a b c d e f it's easy
to imagine just going down the line of
this string and saying does it match
here no here no here no here yes so
we'll return the result but what if
we're matching with the pattern let's
say we have the expression a star B plus
any number of aids followed by one or
more be and in our API notation we would
write that as sequence of star of
literal a plus of literal be and let's
say we're matching that against the
string ay ay ay B now if we had a
control structure that says sequence
look to match the first and then look at
the second and if the first star of
literal a only had one possible result
then it would say yes it matches here
right at the start now look for
something after that does it match plus
of that it'll be no it doesn't so I've
got to have iteration over the possible
results I have to say that star of
literal a can match in more than one
location it can match with zero
instances of a with one with two with
three and it's only after three that
then we can match the second part find
the B and then find that the whole
expression matches so that's going to be
the tricky part is worrying about this
control when one part of a sequence
doesn't match or similarly when we have
an alternative between two possibilities
A or B or alternative of a B so the this
trickiness seems like it's going to be
difficult but it all resolves itself
after we make one good choice
and take some experience to see what
that choice can be but if we decide to
represent these partial results as a set
of remainders of the text then
everything falls into place what do I
mean by a remainder I mean everything
else after the match so we match a
literal a the remainder if after we
match zero characters of this string
would be AAA a 3 a's followed by a bee
the remainder after we match 1a would be
to AIDS followed by B and so on and so
what I'm going to do is define an
auxiliary function called match sad and
it takes a pattern and a text and it
returns this set of remainders and so
when given just this pattern here as the
input star of little rope a and this
text has the text then the remainder
would be set consisting of 3 a's going
to be 2 a's and 2 b 1 a and b or just be
in other words star of little a could
have consumed 0 1 2 or 3 a's and that's
the remainder that's left over and so
the result will be this set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
