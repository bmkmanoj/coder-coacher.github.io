times the square root of five great
solving if you found that one this is a
rough sketch of the points on the
coordinate plane notice that I'm not
precise and that's okay we're really
just after the difference in the X
values and the difference and the Y
values or the change in them so to find
the distance between these two points we
need to set up our right triangle first
we'll find the horizontal distance will
go from x equals 2 to x equals negative
3 that's a distance of five units now if
that's confusing try thinking about it
by starting at x equals negative 3 if we
start at x equals negative 3 and count
up to x equals 2 we will have traveled 5
units horizontally we want to think
about the horizontal distance we're
traveling on a number line now we need
to find the vertical distance we start
at y equals negative 4 which is here and
then we climb all the way up to y equals
6 here the vertical distance between y
equals negative 4 and y equals 6 is 10
units so we know this vertical distance
is simply 10 now that we have the legs
of a right triangle we can solve for the
distance will have the change in x
squared which is 5 squared the change in
Y squared which is 10 squared equal to d
squared alright potenuse will add the
sum of the squares to get d squared
equals 125 and then watch square root
both sides to get one D is equal to the
square root of 25 times 5 we simplify
this square root to get our final answer
of 5 root 5 again great work if you got
some of that correct even more amazing
if you got it right on your first try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
