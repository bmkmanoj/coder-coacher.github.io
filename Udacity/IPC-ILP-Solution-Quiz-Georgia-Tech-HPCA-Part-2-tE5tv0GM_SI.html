have a problem like this we first figure
out the dependencies there is one from
here to here and another one from here
to here and there is also dependence
here from r7 to r7 so now let's look at
our ILP so for ILP we can do this and
this in the first cycle they don't
depend on anything this one needs to be
done in the second cycle because it
depends on the first two instructions
this one however can't be done in the
first cycle this one cannot it needs the
r7 that is produced by this one so this
gets done in the second cycle and then
this one actually doesn't depend on
anything so it can also be done in the
first cycle so as far as ARP is
concerned we have a total of six
instructions executed over two cycles so
the ILP is going to be 3 for the IPC we
have to worry not only about these
dependencies but also that this is a
three-issue processor and that it's in
order so this can still be done in the
first cycle this can be done in the
first cycle
as far as three-issue is concerned this
could be done in the first cycle but
because it has a dependence we still
have to delay it by one cycle and now
the problem is that in an inorder
processor once we don't execute an
instruction we cannot execute
instructions past it because that would
be able to further so this is all that
happens in the first cycle in this
processor in the second cycle we are
able to execute this instruction because
now the first two are done we can
execute this one because now that this
one is done this is eligible for
execution and then we have to stop here
because of these dependence so this
would have to be done in the third cycle
and again we cannot do this so in the
last third cycle we will be able to
finally do this and then this because
they don't depend on each other so they
can be done in the same cycle so now we
have six instructions over three cycles
for an IPC of two it turns out that even
if this was a to issue processor the in
order property really would still limit
us to IPC of two so sometimes one of the
things is gonna be in limitation
sometimes another limitation is gonna
play a dominant role sometimes all of
the limitations are gonna play a role in
limiting our IPC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
