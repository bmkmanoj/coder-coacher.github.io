software is available and the most
recent version numbers it's now time for
us to actually update the software we do
this with the command sudo apt-get
upgrade once again we have to use sudo
remember this is an administrative task
that we have to run as the root user
after a few seconds you'll be presented
with a list of everything that's going
to change on your system and this
question do you want to continue yes or
no will say yes in a second but let's
review this information real quick here
we have a list of packages that will be
upgraded some of these names look
familiar cname Python here and Python
down here but others not so much this
early in setting up a new machine you
can be pretty safe and just accepting
that the system is always making the
best decisions for you later on when you
actually have your web application
running on this system and it's serving
your users you're going to want to take
more care and reviewing this list and
testing everything in a non production
environment before performing similar
operations on your production server for
now we'll just hit yes and we'll go take
a coffee break as all of these new
versions are downloaded and installed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
