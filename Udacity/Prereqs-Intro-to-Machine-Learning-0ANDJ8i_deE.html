make you maximally successful in this
course if you have them
the first is programming experience
especially in Python we'll be making a
lot of use of machine learning libraries
that are available to us in Python and
so when we go in and we start to look at
the code we'll be really zeroing in on
the machine learning parts of it and not
particularly the Python programming
aspects of it so there should be
something that you're fairly familiar
with already so that you don't get stuck
at the programming aspects of this class
the second thing is that you should have
a little bit of familiarity with
statistics we mostly assume that when we
introduce a statistics concept we'll
we'll give you an explanation of it and
some intuition but if you've taken
something like Udacity z-- descriptive
and inferential statistics then you'll
be right on point to follow along
closely with this class in addition to
that you should have a wicked sense of
curiosity and you should be really
excited about solving interesting
problems and using getting your hands on
really interesting data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
