have reached a goal state we put a path
onto the frontier that reaches the goal
Bucharest but we haven't popped that
path off the frontier and uniform cost
search continues to search until we pop
it off the frontier we continue looking
to see if there's a better path that
also reaches the goal so let's see I
forgot to say
fagor Oz is explored so let's continue
let's take the cheapest path on the
frontier and expand that the cheapest
path is this 146 we'll expand that get
another path into Scipio that's a worse
path and we had before so we'll drop it
then let's see what's next
looking on the frontier the cheapest now
is here at 299 we'll expand that we get
a path of cost 374 put that on the
frontier now let's go again now the
cheapest path is over here at 317 we'll
mark that as explored and add two more
paths one here that's a worse path so it
gets dropped and one path that also
reaches the goal and that has a joy
total cost of 418 so that just shows
it's a good thing we waited a good thing
we didn't stop when we found the first
path to the goal because now this second
path found is actually cheaper than the
first path found but we're not going to
stop here because we still haven't
popped off a path that reaches the goal
so we'll continue what's next now the
cheapest path on the frontier is here at
366 we expand that and we get past that
are worse paths to points we've already
seen before so nothing new goes on the
frontier next the cheapest path on the
frontier is at 374 again expanding that
leads nothing useful
only worse paths than we've seen before
and now finally the cheapest path on the
frontier is this 418
the Bucharest so we pop that off and now
we reach the goal and now we stop so
even though we found the 460 path first
we don't stop there because there might
be another path that also reaches the
goal that's cheaper we keep on going
until we pop a path off of the frontier
that reaches the goal and that's why
uniform cost search is guaranteed to
find the cheapest path to the goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
