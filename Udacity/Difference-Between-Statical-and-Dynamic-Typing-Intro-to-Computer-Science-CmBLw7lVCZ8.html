understand the difference between static
and dynamic typing for each property
listed below you should select which
type of language whether it's a
statically typed language are
dynamically typed language is typically
more likely to have that property here
the properties it requires less code for
the same amount of computation check
whether you think it's more likely for a
statically typed language to require
less code or a dynamically typed
language it's less likely for programs
to crash when they're running it's more
fun to program in this is certainly a
little subjective program should execute
faster and it would be a better choice
for programming avionics flight control
software for a new fighter jet this is a
bit subjective and might require a
little bit of speculation on your part
but I think if you think carefully about
the difference between static and
dynamic type checking you'll be able to
answer correctly or at least get the
same answer that I will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
