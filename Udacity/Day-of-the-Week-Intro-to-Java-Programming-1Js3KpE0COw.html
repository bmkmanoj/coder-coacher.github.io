to work it out for a couple of examples
probably the easiest example would be
January 2nd 1906 in this case it would
give one now the day of the week would
be the reference day plus the number of
days that we are away from it so in our
case Monday plus the number of days
after and this will work for this case
but if I take a slightly farther away
case like January 8th 1900 I know that
would be a Monday again but it's seven
days after so I would get that it was
one plus seven which is weekday eight
weekday eight doesn't exist we only have
up to weekday six so what I really mean
to do is start on Monday and add seven
days one two three four five six seven
so instead of continuing up to day seven
and day eight I go back to day zero and
up to day one so that means that I'm
using mod in this case mod seven so the
uncorrected value in that case would
have been eight and to correct it I
would calculate that the actual day of
the week was the original one the
unconnected one mod seven the first
thing I need to do is create a day for
the reference day and I'm actually not
going to use birthday in this case so
this is actually the wrong way to do
this because I might want to use this
program to calculate lots of different
days while I'm testing I'll make this an
easy day like I just mentioned so
January 8 1900 and I'll set up my
reference day so now I'm going to
calculate the days between the reference
day and the desired day using that good
old days from method and now the
uncorrupted weekday would be the weekday
of the reference day I'll call it
reference weekday which is a Monday plus
the number of days between the reference
day and the day we're interested in and
now to get the corrected weekday we take
mod seven
from the uncorrupted weekday let's check
if I made any mistakes I'm pretty sure
that my answer should be Monday
that was what I calculated before I
forgot to say that this is a day and
that one two and the reference weekday
was an INT and I can't find a variable
weekday because what I called two
corrected weekday should actually just
be weekday and that one should work
better so now if I run the method I get
that weekday is minus six must be a bug
so where could I have gone wrong somehow
I got a negative number here I must have
got a negative number because reference
weekday plus day is between is a
negative number
reference weekday is definitely one so
days between must have been negative
it looks like reference day days from
desired day is a negative number but I'm
here assuming that I'm using it to count
up I'm gonna check that using the
debugger I'll put a breakpoint in and
I'll run the method so when I step over
the line where I initialize days between
I can now see that days between is
coming out as negative seven so my
suspicion is confirmed instead of
calling reference day days from desired
day I should have called desired date
days from reference day let's try this
one out now I actually get the weekday I
expected and I'm ready to go back and
reset this day to the day I was
interested in which was June 18th 1983
