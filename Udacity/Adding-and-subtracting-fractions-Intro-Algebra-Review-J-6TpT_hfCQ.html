cut into 8 slices we remember that Bob
and I are sharing the pizza we know that
if I eat two slices so these are my two
slices that's me and Bob and this is Bob
eats one slice of pizza that means we've
eaten one two three slices of pizza
would remember from our previous example
that I ate two eighths of the pizza
because two slices out of the eight
total slices and Bob 81 eighth of the
pizza that's his one slice out of the
eight total slices and together we ate
three eighths of the pizza how can we
find out how many pieces of pizza are
left well we could just count them and
see that we have one two three four five
pieces of pizza left but i'd like to
show this in a fraction to show what's
going on with a fraction we should start
with eight eighths because that
represents the whole pizza eight slices
out of eight then we should subtract the
amount that we've eaten already which is
three-eighths this problem is in a
convenient form for us because we can
see that the denominators are the same
they are common denominators when we
have fractions like this with common
denominators all we have to do is look
at the numerators we know that no matter
what the fraction that results will have
an eight in the denominator so what's
eight minus 35 and when fractions have
common denominators we know that the
denominator here will be the same thing
as what we have here so it's 858 just
like when we counted so remember when
you have common denominators in your
fractions all you have to do is keep the
denominator the same and then add or
subtract what's in the numerator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
