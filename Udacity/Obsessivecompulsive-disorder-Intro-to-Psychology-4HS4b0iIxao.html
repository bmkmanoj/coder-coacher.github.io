the most common types of OCD and it
interferes with normal functioning of
daily life for example a person with OCD
who fears germs is going to spend an
excessive amount of time of worrying
about germs they're going to be thinking
about all the germs that surround them
worrying about touching something and
acquiring new germs
now these anxious thoughts that they
have are combatted by the compulsive
behaviors that they engage in for
example a person who's afraid of germs
may wash their hands two to three
hundred times a day in scalding hot
water or perhaps they wash them five to
six times a day but for thirty to forty
minutes at a time the person is aware of
these compulsions but they're unable to
stop them
a person with checking OCD may have to
check the stove repeatedly before
leaving the house to make sure it's off
even though they haven't cooked at home
in months and finally a person with
counting OCD maybe has to touch a
doorknob 14 times for fear that his dog
will die if he doesn't even though he
knows that there's really no connection
between how many times he touches a
doorknob and the fate of his dog so the
main thing to remember is that the
person is aware of these compulsions but
they're still unable to stop them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
