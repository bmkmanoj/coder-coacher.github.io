the biggest surprise to you over the
past 10 years is there any new
capability platform or social phenomenon
that has stood out in your mind I think
the the way the games industry is really
driving the graphics hardware vendors is
very interesting to me I've gone through
several cycles in my career where the
hardware goes from let's have a separate
card for graphics to let's put it back
on the cpu through let's go back out to
the graphics card and this sort of has
this this cycle and now we're seeing the
point where graphics cards have more
power than the CPU in many cases with
with all the cores in them and the
programmability and the way that the
vendors are working together with the
games developers and with the other
developers so try to figure out what is
good to keep programmable and as you
know if you can turn a given algorithm
into a fixed function and just hard
coding transistors you have much better
performers like texturing one of the
things where originally it was
programmable but then they put it into
fixed function to get the performance
out of it so working together with the
industry I really like the way that's
going it I didn't see that as much 20
years ago with the card vendors they
were sort of on the room but now they
have that collaboration going on I mean
I think what we see with you know mobile
and handheld devices is really a big
disruption and you know it has been
amazing what's happening here and like
the how much rent the amount of
rendering power you have like in your
pocket every day and often I think like
one way of you know just seeing how
amazing it is like if you sit down like
in an airplane where they have another
those like touch screen devices but it's
often like five or ten years old because
you know the upgrade sake cycles for
airlines is so long it looks like Stone
Age technology compared to what you have
in your pocket so yeah that that's
obviously something that is happening
now and it's it's pretty amazing with
interact i mean when i started doing
rendering it was very much on a desktop
you hit the render button and you came
back the next day and that was like a
big thing for me in a big problem so now
to see live interactive web rendering
its kind of blowing my mind and I'm just
I know that soon we'll be able
model and completely rendered lighted
objects without having to you know hit
the render button and dread the results
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
