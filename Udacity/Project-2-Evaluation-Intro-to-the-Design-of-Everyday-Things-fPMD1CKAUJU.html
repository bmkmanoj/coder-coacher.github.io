what's going on here well I I gotten
some feedback and uh yeah you wanna try
it oh sure
Wow where do I start okay well tell me
the first thing that stands out is this
guy here and I immediately want to lift
it okay I'm turning this around oh gosh
this looks dangerous
but I still want to touch it come on
turning this around here there's some
text here it looks like it's telling a
bit of a story there was a little pig
who was chasing a wolf it makes me kind
of want to turn the box here oh and
sparkles who doesn't love sparkles or
someone to touch this mm-hmm what's
going on yeah and as we saw people did
various things with it
mm-hmm well there was a few things that
I did intentionally here one is that I
made these finger holds just the right
size you'd grab it like a bowling ball
well that's human size and here it's a
little tempting to kind of touch it and
maybe somebody would want to flitter
with those and the balls kind of feel
nice and well somewhere there's this
squishy thing that you play with you
could even pick the box up from that and
there's a tail so why do we grab this
it's got an affordance for for grabbing
ah and there's one more thing I'm using
the power of story here because it says
once a pawn and then you turn it once
upon a time there was a little pig who
was chasing a wolf down a rabbit hole
well yeah there's my box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
