slightly the fastest of all of these on
the diagonal 64 threads per block
operating on 16 items each and so the
thing to notice is that throughput is
generally increasing as the granularity
per thread increases right so having
threads do more and more serial work
it's generally a good thing on the other
hand if you've got a fixed tile size in
other words the tile here is the total
number of items that were scanning over
for a fixed tile size there's
diminishing returns these numbers get
smaller and smaller sorry the
improvements get smaller and smaller as
you approach this the sweet spot because
you're trading off increased granularity
per thread for decreased parallelism and
then it starts to go up again and in my
measurements on Fermi which is the same
GPU that you'll be using on the Udacity
IDE I get 32 by 32 being slightly slower
than 64 threads with 16 items each and
at some point you get to the point where
you can no longer fit a problem size in
a single threads registers and then
performance falls off a cliff again and
for me on Fermi 64 items per thread
running at only 16 threads it really
starts to get pretty bad performance
again I encourage you to play around
experiment a little bit more to see what
the rest of this matrix looks like and
if you're interested go check out the
cub home page and see what else you can
do there's different varieties of blocks
can for example there's work efficient
and and step efficient varieties of
blocks can and so experiment a little
bit and see how fast you can get this
scan throughput how many how few clocks
you can spend per element scanned now
what I found is that with the right
balance you can have a computational
overhead of less than one clock cycle
per item scanned that's really pretty
remarkable think about running this code
on a CPU right you couldn't really
achieve less than one clock for items
scanned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
