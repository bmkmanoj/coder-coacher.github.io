internet hmm that's a really good
question but I think it depends on what
you mean by the internet like a network
of computers that talk to each other
okay um well I know the Greeks didn't
have a network of computers but they did
have a network and in fact we talked
about just this question in one of
Udacity is free online computer science
classes so let's take a look so what
does it take to make a network like this
work so let's suppose we wanted to send
a message from roads to Sparta and we
have many points along the way where we
can send smoke signals so we'd start by
sending a smoke signal from roads this
will be visible from a few other points
and to reach Sparta the one at nachos
would need to resend it we need to also
submit a smoke signal that would be
visible at some other points the one at
melos would need to see it and resend it
and maybe that's already visible at
Sparta that's amazing so ancient Greek
smoke signals are essentially the same
as the internet it's so simple they're
not quite the same thing yes they're
both networks but the Internet has to do
with problems like encoding and routing
but those are deeper issues if you want
to learn more you should just enroll and
Udacity is introduction to computer
science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
