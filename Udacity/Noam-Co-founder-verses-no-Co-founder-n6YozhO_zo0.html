business for a long time and he didn't
have any co-founder and he made a lot of
money but one day he had a new idea and
he decided to start a new company and
this time with physical hunger it was
also a sole founder before and when they
started collaborating it was it it was
amazing all of a sudden they build the
business that go the go so fast that it
diminished everything that they did
before and that's my personal opinion
that it's much better to have a
co-founder but they proved himself as
sole founders before and they were very
successful before that so everything is
possible I believe that someone who
wants to do his own business by himself
he definitely can do it he's probably
more lonely lonely lonely person that
they prefer to walk along and trust
mainly on himself it's a different it's
a different social structure it's a
different personality and I know a lot
of successful people that did just that
or people who had co-founders that are
not as the dominant as them or not not
as important in the company's them that
they have much more aight aight aight
personality and they did amazingly well
also everybody can succeed there's no
right or wrong that's my personal
preference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
