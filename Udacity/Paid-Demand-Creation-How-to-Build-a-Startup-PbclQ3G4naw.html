are persona is the next thing I want to
figure out is how do I get them into
this funnel regardless of whether it's
web or mobile I need to somehow figure
out how to get the interests of my
customer archetypes you know Dave and
major urban area or Sally in the Midwest
or someone in China or India how do I
get them interested and there are two
types of ways to create demands the
first set of things are paid demand
creation activities fancy word for
saying I'm gonna pay somebody to get
your interest first people I might want
to pay is a public relations agency I
might pay them a certain fee per month
to help get stories about my products
appear and/or my company in newspapers
or on blogs or in tech journals etc and
so hiring a PR agencies and I paid
demand creation activities
another common paid activity is
advertising what kind of advertising
well it depends what my archetype reads
they read a blog I want to somehow get
either keywords or banner ads or
something on the blog if they read
newspapers or tech journals or listen to
radio or television that is I want to
match my demand creation activities to
what I know about my archetype I'm not
gonna randomly do this I'm actually
gonna try to match what I know to what
I'm gonna pay for next thing could be
trade shows in some industries people
still physically go to trade shows have
booths walk the aisles meet people maybe
I should be in one and have a booth and
maybe I'll find out my archetypes don't
even care and by the way just as an
aside you might also want to be worried
about where do your partners show up
maybe they show up at trade shows the
other thing is I might find out instead
of trade shows and or webinars might be
interesting or I just might want to be
sending them email or direct mail the
u.s. post office or post offices and in
other countries they're still happy to
carry your advertising though these
become less and less effective the more
and more people are on the web and then
finally search engine marketing Google
AdWords Facebook ads etc are now just a
standard way to pay for demand creation
activities regardless of whether it's a
physical channel or a mobile channel all
of these activities are designed to feed
the sales funnel that demand creation
funnel is going to be fed by these
