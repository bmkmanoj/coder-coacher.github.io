plus for one or more copies sometimes
it's nice to have zero or more copies so
we'll introduce this star regular
expression for that you can convert
between the two of them if you wanted
one or more copies of a you could have a
followed by zero more copies of a some
classes or texts will teach the star
first and then move on to the plus we
teach the plus first because its more
common for specifying Python and
JavaScript so now the plus the star the
question mark the open square brackets
the close square brackets they all mean
something special in regular expressions
they help us denote sets of strings but
what if the string I want to match is
actually just a plus sign how do I do it
if plus means one or more copies of what
came before we need some way of saying
no no I really mean it actually plus not
one or more just plus we're gonna solve
this by using something called escape
sequences but before I get into them
let's introduce them by way of analogy
in Python you can declare a string using
double quotes or single quotes so if you
want to have a constant string that
reads P and P is Jane's book if you use
single quotes Python will get confused
because you have one here one here and
one there and it will think your string
ends at the E and Jane no problem you
say I will just use double quotes that's
what they're there for
but what if you want to include quoted
dialogue in your string so now I want to
say I said P and P is Jane's book so now
I'm using both the single quote and the
double quote for their actual meanings
what do I put on the side
well Python will actually let you bypass
this by using triple quotes but what if
I really wanted to have triple quotes in
the middle too we can't do this forever
well it turns out that if I just put a
backward slash a back slash in front of
a quote or a double quote or whatnot
Python will treat it as being part of
this string and not as being the end of
the string we're escaping out of
treating quotes as string two limiters
so this is pythons way of saying no no I
really mean it actually have the quote
there now when you actually go to write
this down in Python you may not get
different colors or different fonts so
this may be a little hard to read but
does work I can use these escape
sequences to literally write down
special character the backslash is
sometimes called an escape character and
the two of these together are an escape
sequence a sequence of characters that
are treated as if it were just the
double quotes just a single quote note
that Python is throwing away this
backslash you won't actually see it just
to show you how this sort of thing plays
out in Python I've written down two
different versions of P and P as Jane's
book when using double quotes and one
using an escape sequence we're going to
print out both of their values and then
check to see if they're actually equal
and in fact they are even though we
entered them slightly differently Python
treats them both of the same internally
and indicates that they're equal here's
one more example of this this time with
a double quote being escaped twice and
again the two strings are equal under
the hood as Python deals with them turns
out that we can do the same thing in
regular expressions suppose you want to
find this string plus plus this regular
expression backslash plus backslash Plus
has to escape sequences and it finds
only the string plus plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
