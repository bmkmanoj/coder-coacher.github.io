problem domains both to see how we can
apply current theories of analogical
reasoning to them and also to see how we
can use those problem domains to build
new theories of analogical reasoning so
let us turn now to the domain of design
and design there is a new movement that
is sometimes called biologically
inspired design or biomimicry this
movement is pulled by the need for
environmental sustainability and it's
pushed by the desire for creativity and
innovation and design on the top left
here is that picture of the shinkansen
500 train in Japan this is the bullet
train it's called a bullet train because
of the shape of its nose this particular
shape is inspired by the shape of the
beak of the Kingfisher this story goes
something like this Japanese railway
engineers were interested in building
faster trains however they had a problem
these trains had to go through tunnels
and as they went to tunnels they created
shock waves which created a lot of noise
bothering the neighbors the shockwave
was created because after the tunnel and
inside the tunnel were two different
mediums by serendipity the railway
engineers looked at how the Kingfisher
goes from the medium of air into a
medium of water dips it beak and catches
the spray the shape of its nose allows
us to create a smaller shockwave they
use the same principle to create the
design of the nose of the bullet train
Shinkansen 500 travels faster than
previous trains and also makes less
noise than previous trains mostly
because of the nose shape another
example often cited and bio-memory
creates the example of a mercedes-benz
box car designed by inspiration to the
box fish notice as biologically inspired
design entails analogical reasoning
there's a target problem there is a
source case there is cross domain
analogical transfer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
