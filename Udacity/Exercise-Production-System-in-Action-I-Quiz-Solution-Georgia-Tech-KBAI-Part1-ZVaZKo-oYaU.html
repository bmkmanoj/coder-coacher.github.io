like sora agrees with me so based on the
first production rule the goal is to
escape there are two outs there's a run
around second and there's no runner on
first so the goal is now to
intentionally walk the batter if the
goal is intentionally walk then we
suggest the intentional walk operator
nothing else adds any other operators so
there's only one operator selected and
so that's sent to the motor system so
ends up selecting the intentional walk
operator there was right David so note
what happened they were the contents of
the working memory here were all the
rules available in the procedural part
of the long-term memory and so then
match the contents of the working memory
with the antecedents of the various
productions depending on the match
between the contents of the working
memory and the antecedents of the rules
some rules got activated of fired as
some people say depending about what
will got fired that resulted in perhaps
firing of additional rules so as David
said if the rule number one got
activated because the goal became
intentionally walked a batter that then
led to the activation a rule number
three which was to select the
intentional walk operator in this way
given the set of contents of the working
memory and the matching between those
contents and the antecedents of the
various production rules that capture
the procedural knowledge some rules get
activated and this activation continues
until sir cannot activate any additional
rules at that point sword is given in
the answer based on the consequent of
the rule that matters a motor action
note that so just provided an account of
how the pitcher decided on a specific
page on a specific action note that we
have started with the goal of providing
on account of how the pitcher selection
an action or how an air agent I select
an attack on an action so what is the
account based on the goal and the
percepts match them with the anti
students of the rules
that capture the procedural knowledge
and then accept the consequent of some
production that matches some motor
action from some percepts we have gone
to some action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
