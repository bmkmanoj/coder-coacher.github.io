working with the language that uses
closures is it's not always particularly
obvious when a piece of code is going to
be run when Gradle is invoked with the
meme of a task to perform it can't just
go ahead and execute that task it first
has to figure out that tasks dependency
and those tasks dependencies and so on
Gradle then executes all the tasks and
in the correct order before the target
task is eventually executed that means
that before any task execution happens
the whole dependency graph has to be
created there are actually three phases
to the lifecycle of any Gradle build the
initialization configuration and
execution the initialization phase is
mostly concerned with setting up multi
project builds which we'll talk about
later in the course in the configuration
phase the build script is executed which
configures all the projects tasks this
is when the directed acyclic graph of
the task is built up and Gradle
determines which tasks need to be run
and in which order then finally in the
execution phase all the task actions of
all the tasks that are chosen are
executed in the proper order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
