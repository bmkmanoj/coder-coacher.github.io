recall when I had his sentence Ashok ate
a frog I said let's focus on the verb
form now that was indeed correct but one
can have frames were nouns as well so
what could have a frame for Angela for
lasagna of Olive Garden of a night if
one had a frame for Angela and lasagna
and so on in that case one could instead
of saying Angela here point to a frame
for Angela here is an illustration which
shows you that we may have other
information about Angela quite apart
from that sentence about Angela having
lasagna with a dad and that information
might be pulled together with this frame
for eat to this pointer so that not this
frame for it gets connected with this
frame for Angela similarly we may have
some information about the restaurant of
olive garden we may know for example the
olive garden look at in Atlanta or there
is a particular price range so two ideas
first not only frames have bulbs but
also for nouns and second frames can get
connected with each other so that the
filler of a slot in one frame can point
to under the frame so choke it sounds
like this kind of representation can be
used to make even more advanced
inferences so if I have a frame for
Angela my frame for Angela might have a
slot that says food preferences and
under that food preference slot the
filler might be Italian food and then
when I see this representation based on
that slot and that filler I can then
infer that she's not only happy she's
very happy because she had one of her
favorite foods that's a good point David
so far we have been talking about
sentence level understanding this
sentence that Angela ate lasagna at
olive garden with a dad for example but
we can also talk about this course level
understanding a discourse may contain a
series of sentences one offer the other
so the first sentence for instance may
say something about Angela and her food
preferences and we may construct a frame
for Angela the second thing that may say
something about a restaurant called
olive garden which is located at lon top
and we may construct a frame for you
olive garden when in
sentence comes and says that Angela had
lasagna was a diet at Olive Garden we
construct a frame then we can hook up
these various frames and now we need to
get a discourse level understanding not
just a sentence level understanding so
indeed just like a frame enables us to
understand some unit of language for
example a sentence or a phrase when we
start hooking up these frames together
we can start understanding largely units
of language for example a group of
sentences of discourse as will go along
we will see these frames also allow us
to pull information from the input
sentences to put in the fillers or these
slots so indeed the ability to hook
these frames together allows for lot of
complex inferences and they will be a
major part of common sense reasoning as
we continue with this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
