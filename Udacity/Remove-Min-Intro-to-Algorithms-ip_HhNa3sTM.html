this heap based technology is to allow
us to do two things efficiently one is
getting and removing them in and the
other one is inserting new elements into
the heap we like both of those to run
and log in time and if they are then we
can use them in the top-k scenario that
I was describing before so finding them
in is really easy right it's the tippy
top of the tree so in fact getting them
in done easy constant time the problem
is if we go to remove them in look what
happens there's this sort of gaping
volcanic hole at the top whatever will
we do to fix this you know we kind of
have broken our big nice heap into two
small nice heaps but we really need them
to be one nice heap so what can we do
well it would be nice if we had some
kind of node someplace that we could
fill in here and then maybe down heapify
it the natural place to get that note
though is right there the very last
element to the heap it's some value
actually popping it off of there doesn't
cause any damage to the heap we can move
it to the tippy top and run down heapify
once that concludes in about log and
time we've got ourselves a heap again
we're back in business so the steps were
so the steps were remove the l0 node
copy a last node to the tippy top then
run down heapify on this now snugly
smaller heap right it's only I've got n
minus 1 elements in it now but we run
down heapify on it we reestablished heap
property and we are done log in time
once you write some Python code to
actually do this to remove man it's only
a couple lines long will give you down
heapify and and the build heap algorithm
so that you can take a list create a
heap out of it and then remove them in
from it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
