proof by intimidation in this case we
can prove this by dividing by P I so
what happens when we divided by P I well
the left side we have this product of
primes so we're going to still have this
product of primes now removing p I from
the product plus the one which is now
divided by P I and we divided p I out of
P I times Q so we have Q here this is
our contradiction q is an integer this
is an integer p I cannot be one because
it's a prime it must be some integer to
or greater so that means that this is
not a whole number so there's no way we
could get an integer as q by adding
something that's not an integer to an
integer thus we've shown that there are
infinitely many primes by contradicting
our assumption that there was a limited
set of primes this isn't quite enough to
be happy that we can generate large
prime numbers when we need them we need
to know how dense the primes are and how
to find a large prime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
