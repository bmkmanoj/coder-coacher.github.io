constructing deterministic distributed
algorithms it turns out it may be
sufficient for many situations the
airline reservation example I started
with will work fine with a partial order
of events dictated by lamport's clock
but there are situations where there may
be a need for a total order of events in
the distributed system let's look at an
example here is an example to illustrate
the need for a total order I'm gonna use
my own personal life example to
illustrate the need for total order I
have one car and my family consists of
my wife my son and my daughter and we
share this single car and what we want
to do is make sure that we can make
local decision on who gets dibs on using
the car at any point of time and we're
going to use lamport's clock for this so
what we do is whenever we want to get
the car for our personal use we're going
to text everyone with a timestamp I'm
going to associate a timestamp if I'm if
I'm requesting the car I'm gonna text
everyone and associate a timestamp with
that request and it is a logical
timestamp and similarly my wife would do
the same thing son and daughter all of
us do the same thing and how do we pick
the winner
well locally we can look at the
timestamp of requests that have come in
from others and my own requests and
whoever has the earliest timestamp wins
pretty simple right
so pretty simple everybody is going to
make a local decision looking at the
timestamps of requests that have come in
from others and say well you know right
now it's my son's turn to use the car or
my daughter's turn to use the car and so
on well what if the timestamp because
these are locally generated by each one
of us happens to be the same so for
instance let's say my son makes a
request text sends a text message my son
makes a request sends a text message
with a timestamp 10 to all of us so this
is the blue arrow that's going
everywhere so that's indicating to all
three of us that he wants the car and
timestamp 10 is when he generated the
request so happens my wife also makes a
request for using the car exactly with
the same timestamp 10
and that's the purple arrow that you see
so now we have a problem and the problem
is all of us are looking at these text
messages and trying to make a decision
who's got the dibs on using the car how
will my son and my wife know given that
both the timestamp is the same which one
is the winner for using this car now
what we do is we're going to break the
tie and I'm gonna stipulate that age
wins and therefore in this case if the
timestamp happens to be exactly the same
then my wife by seniority as the winner
she gets a card so that's how we break
the tie you can see through this example
that there is a need for total order in
decision-making when you have a
distributed system and you want to make
local decisions without bothering anyone
based on information that you have but
you have to make that local decision
unambiguously because you cannot have
both my son and wife thinking that they
have the car at the same time that'll be
a problem so whenever there is a tie we
have to break that and that's the need
for the total order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
