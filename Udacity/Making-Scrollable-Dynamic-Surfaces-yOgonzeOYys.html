example Roman discussed the awesome
thing about this is that most of the
logic lies in the layout file and the
Java code stays pretty tame the only
time we referred to the collapsing
toolbar layout is here where we assign
the title collapsing toolbar layout
allows us to set the title style when
the toolbar is expanded or collapsed
we're explore in a moment why this is
useful so let's take a look at another
food inspired app as we can see we don't
have to be limited to a solid background
when dealing with a collapsing toolbar
when you scroll the image disappears in
the word eclairs appears in the app bar
the interesting bits about this image
view are right here we want the image to
have a parallax effect as it collapses
that's to say that the foreground moves
faster than the background providing a
sense of depth to the scene in this
layout we have a textview whose content
takes up a lot of space we would expect
to need to use a scroll view without
this line the app doesn't know when to
scroll the toolbar so your toolbar
remains stationary this is because app
bar layout expects to have a sibling and
coordinator layout that is capable of
nested scrolling you can do that with a
nested scrollviews from the sport
library or by setting nested scrolling
enabled to true the nested scrolling
enable property is only present on
scroll view for a lollipop in above
nested scrolling works with coordinator
layout to notify and manage when the app
bar should be scrolling the nested view
should be scrolling both should be
scrolling or none
check the instructors notes for some
resources on app bar layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
