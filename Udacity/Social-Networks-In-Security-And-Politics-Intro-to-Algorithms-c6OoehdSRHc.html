social networks fit into the history of
the use of technology in political
protests right so this is a really an
interesting topic in that you know with
the dictators what they want is they
want a lot of people to believe that
everybody's happy right with what's
going on so they don't want a lot of
people to know that people are unhappy
so what happened was during the nineteen
seventy-nine revolution Iranian
Revolution people were passing
information through cassettes for the
world enough to know what kiss hats are
and during the Tiananmen Square uprising
people were passing information through
facts so and with the use of fax machine
now with you know smartphones and
Twitter and Facebook people can pass
information very rapidly so I would know
if there's a protest how many of my
friends are going to go or or how many
people will go right and if I feel like
a good mass of people and a girl and
that we can really damage the government
then I would go right and so we have
models to that show you know whether the
particular movement will spread or
whether it will stop and so on and so
forth so it's very exciting work now
much science efficient and oak analysis
coming to cyber security because if you
think about cybersecurity what is
cybersecurity what am i what is cyber
cyber is just the collection of machines
that are networked together right so I
send an email from my your machine and
so on and so forth and that's an
Information Network and underlying it is
a physical network of machines I'm that
are linked to each other and so you can
think of it well if I'm a bad guy and I
want to spread a virus through this
network how do it it's similar to this
idea of Epidemiology right like with
between people network and how viruses
spread and whether you're you're more
susceptible to to get a virus than not
right so if your pc is more prevalent
maybe you're more susceptible to some of
the viruses that are app the majority of
viruses are for PCs right now and that's
for max or for example if I'm a good guy
how would I stop a virus from spreading
so which speaks should I take away or
which nodes shouldn't
take away notes here being computers
right and next this also is analogous to
people network right if I if I don't
want it piece of information to spread
which person should I take out right if
you for some definition of take out I
guess I've been watching a lot of murder
mystery you have worked for the
government so so this is how it comes in
cyber security and in fact if you think
about it social networks are built on
top of information networks and then
that's built on top of physical networks
and so the interdependencies between
these networks is very interesting to
study and see you know well if I take
out part of a physical network how will
that affect information network in the
social network so I'm in fact we have
seen recently for example again with the
demonstrations when government take down
their internet because they don't want
people to talk to each other but we have
seen that even though they take down the
internet because there's a phone network
and and the Twitter apps and all these
other apps are also through phones and
voice that people can can can can
communicate information now so it's just
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
