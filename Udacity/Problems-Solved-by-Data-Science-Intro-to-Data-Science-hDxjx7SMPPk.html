data science is and what data scientists
do let's talk about how data science can
be applied across a wide spectrum of
industries you might have signed up for
this class under the notion that if you
become a data scientist you'll end up
working for a Silicon Valley startup
while it's true that most tech companies
do employ data scientists data science
can also be used to solve problems in
many different fields what are some
examples of the types of problems being
solved using data science well for one
Netflix uses collaborative filtering
algorithms to recommend movies to users
based on things they've previously
watched also elements of many popular
social media websites are powered by
data science things like recommending
new connections on LinkedIn constructing
your Facebook newsfeed
or suggesting new people to follow on
Twitter many other online services are
apps such as dating websites like
OkCupid or ride sharing services like
uber use the vast amount of user data
available to them not only to customize
and improve the user experience but also
to publish interesting anthropological
findings regarding people's behavior in
the offline world on their blogs ok so I
know what you're thinking so far all of
these seem like problems data scientists
are expected to solve but data
scientists work in many domains data
science concepts are integral in
processing and modeling data and field
of bioinformatics where scientists are
working on projects like annotating
genomes and analyzing data sequences
this past summer data science for social
good fellows in Chicago worked on a
project attempting to solve Chicago's
bus crowding issues using data in
addition physicists use data science
concepts when building a 100 terabyte
database of astronomical data collected
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey this
one's cool analyzing electronic medical
records allowed the city of Camden New
Jersey to save enormous amounts of money
by targeting their efforts towards
specific buildings accounting for a
majority of emergency admissions finally
NBA teams like the Toronto Raptors are
installing a new technology sports view
cameras on the basketball court so
collect huge amounts of data on players
movement and playing styles this helps
teams to better analyze in-game trends
and
of coaching decisions you've probably
noticed by now that data science is
making an impact in areas far and wide
data science isn't simply a trendy new
way to think about tech problems it's a
tool that can be used to solve problems
in a variety of fields data scientists
are working at Silicon Valley startups
to enrich our online experiences but
they're also doing important work in our
cities in our laboratories and in our
sports stadiums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
