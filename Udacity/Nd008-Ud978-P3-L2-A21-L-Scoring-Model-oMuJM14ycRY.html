now we can just sit back relax and let
our beautiful model do all the work
we're now up to the easy part of our
analysis what we're going to do is use
our historical model to predict the
future the first thing we're going to do
is output our model object that we're
going to use to then score or data set
we don't have to do this but I just
think it's best practice to output this
so we don't have to run the logistic and
the stepwise model over and over and
over again so the only thing we need to
do bring an output data tool connect it
to the model object that we want to
output and then name this model and save
it off to a certain location so what I'm
going to do is just call it mo d4 model
object obj and then i'll call it step at
the end it's going to be saved off as a
why XD be type of format let me run this
model and then after this what I'm going
to do is open up a blank canvas and
input that data set so bring an input
data tool and input my model object what
I'm also going to bring in is the data
set that I want to score so that's going
to be our exact same data set we read in
to build the former model on but not
broken out into estimation and
validation samples I still need to make
my manipulations with the Select tool to
make sure we have the correct field
types for our different values now
lastly what I want to do is I want to
bring in that score tool the score tool
needs no real configuration and you can
plug in your model object and your data
set into either side what we're going to
do now is bring in a browse tool and run
this model if you look at the output
with the score tool in the Browse tool
we are able to see that we have a
predictive probability that that
individual will not respond or will
respond to this marketing campaign as
you can see these first individuals are
very likely to redeem a future offer
while these individuals are not very
likely to redeem a future offer so let's
think about
this what we were just able to do is
determine the predictive probability to
redeem an offer for every single
individual now that we've completed the
modeling and scoring it is time to
report our findings over to the boss</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
