infrequently this may seem a little
surprising if it was random well the
probability of two consecutive values
being equal should be to the negative
128 a very low probability but not zero
if this is an encryption cipher well it
satisfies the property of invertibility
so any value that's different here
encrypts to a different value so that
would mean that for our actual
pseudo-random number generator this
probability is actually equal to zero
and that's different from what it would
be in a real random sequence this
probability is low enough that we still
wouldn't expect a repetition for a long
time but we would expect to have one
within the first two to the seventeen
outputs and we'll talk soon about the
birthday paradox to see why we would
expect one this soon still a pretty big
number but it would be enough to
distinguish this from pure randomness so
to fix that there's a couple things we
could do one is to occasionally change
the key and after some number of outputs
we can take one output instead of using
it as an output we use it as the new key
so even if we don't have any more
randomness
we'll still change the key that will
affect this probability will no longer
be zero we'll start seeing values that
have some probability of repeating what
we saw with the previous key so we'll
get a new key every few million outputs
the other concern is whether this pool
of randomness is good enough on UNIX
machines there is a pool of randomness
stored in dev random and as collecting
events that are believed to be random
and out of the controller of the
attacker these could be user actions
like he presses these could be things
that you collect over the network
there's some risk that these could be
compromised that some of them could be
controlled or at least predictable the
attacker so we want to have multiple
pools of randomness and combine them in
a way that makes it very difficult for
an attacker to control this seed and
this is essentially what the Fortuna
pseudo random number generator does and
that's one of the more popular widely
used ones it does use this rekeying to
avoid this apparently non-random
property and it uses multiple holes of
randomness selected in a way that makes
it very hard for an attacker to control
what this seed is even if the attacker
can control one or a few of the pools of
randomness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
