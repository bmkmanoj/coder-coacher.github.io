recording cases a little bit more
closely implicit in our discussion so
far has been the notion of most similar
or most closely resembling but how can
we operationalize it how can we make it
more explicit so once again here is the
world of various colored blocks and we
can represent these various blocks back
to the notion of knowledge
representation we can represent our
knowledge of these various blocks in a
two-dimensional grid the width of the
block and the height of the block so a
blue block may lie here the red block
here and so on so when that new problem
comes along we may represent it and this
same to damage to a grid in this
particular case the new problem made it
be represented at this particular dot
now given all the cases and the new
problem we may calculate the distance
between the new problem to each of the
previous known cases once we are
calculate the distance between the new
problem and each of the previous cases
we can simply select the case which is
closest to the new problem this method
is called a nearest neighbor method now
we need a way of calculating the
distance between a problem and a case
one measure of the distance is called
the Euclidean distance here is a formula
for the Euclidean distance Euclidean
distance between two points X OC and Y
of C which define the case and the X of
N and the y of n which define the
problem is given by this formula now we
can easily calculate the Euclidean
distance between each of the cases and
your problem and this table summarizes
the distances given this table we can
really quickly see that the case of the
black block is closest to the new
problem and therefore one might give the
answer that the new block is also black
in color so the nearest neighbor method
is one method of finding the most
similar case or the most closely
resembling case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
