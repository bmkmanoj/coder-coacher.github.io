selection I think Albert Einstein
probably said it best when he said you
should make everything as simple as
possible but no simpler this is the idea
behind feature selection that you want
to have the minimal number of features
that it takes to really capture the
trends and the patterns in your data
your machine learning algorithm is only
going to be as good as the features that
you put into it so this is a place where
you should really put some time and
attention as a machine learner there are
two major things that are involved here
the first is that you should have a way
to select the best features that are
available to you in other words getting
rid of the stuff that doesn't help you
very much on the other hand there will
be hopefully patterns in your data that
you need to draw out and so potentially
adding new features can be ways that you
can use your human intuition to access
those patterns we'll go through both of
these examples in this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
