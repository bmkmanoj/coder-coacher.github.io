more recently with widgets both are good
examples of API is provided by the
Android system to let your app extend
beyond the full screen activity we
started with however this isn't limited
to just the system apps can also provide
api's you can integrate into your app to
further extend your app a little
research shows that this is exactly how
mousse a does it's magic it extends the
live wallpaper API provided by Android
it gives us an easy API where we only
worry about sending moose a new
wallpapers and it does all the work
actually displaying them to the user
controlling things i like how bright or
blurred the picture should be fixing
those issues with readability we
mentioned before and even mirroring the
wallpaper over to Android wear devices
if the user wants so how do we do it
first we'll add a Gradle dependency then
a manifest entry for our musee art
source moussa art source is an intense
service which removes a will connect to
to get our wallpapers the intent filter
is how musait knows it can connect to
our service will also include special
icon description and even a color to
help make sunshine feel at home so what
happens when a user selects our app for
their wallpapers first we're going to
call back in our moves a art source of
unlabeled then on subscriber added then
comes the most important one on update
this is where we'll publish our
wallpaper making it available to mu Z
similarly upon selecting a different app
will get a non-subscriber removed and on
disabled call back so what would our on
update look like we'll do a simple query
to get the current weather use a new
utility method get image URL for weather
condition to get the appropriate
wallpaper URL then build up an artwork
object in our case will include the
image URL will use the description of
the weather as the title or main piece
of content and then we'll use the
location query as the byline or
secondary line of text Musa offers the
ability to open more details loading the
main active
your sunshine seems like a good way of
seeing more details to me we'll pass
that artwork through to publish artwork
like magic we'll see moose a handle all
the image loading live wallpaper code
and other work to get our imagery on the
user's wallpaper eat while we have the
option of using mousse A's schedule
update method we can use the same
approach as our widget and use our data
changed action to trigger an update that
way whenever the data changes will
update the wallpaper as well in this
case though we're triggering a service
so we'll add a start service call to our
sync adapter then our on handle intent
can include a special check for the data
updated action and if we're enabled and
the user has selected us as their
background source we can call our own
update method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
