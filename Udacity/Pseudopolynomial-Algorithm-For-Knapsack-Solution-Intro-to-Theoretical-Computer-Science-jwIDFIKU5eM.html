objects and that is seven and the number
of columns is the total sum of all the
values so two plus three plus five plus
four plus three plus five plus two which
is twenty four so we have seven rows and
twenty four columns in this table we're
going to fill this out row by row so we
start out in Row one and Row two and so
on so for row I and column J what we
want in this table is the minimum size
required to achieve a value of exactly J
using the objects 1 2 I now in the first
row we only have the first object
available so the only thing that we can
achieve is a value of 2 using size 3 so
value of 2 using size 3 and all of the
other ones are just not possible second
row we have two objects available we
have objects a and B available so what
we can achieve is a value of 2 a value
of 3 and a value of 5 now for a value of
2
we need size 3 again for a value of 3 we
can do that with size 2 and for a value
of 5
we need size 5 and I'll fill out one
more row here for you I'm not going to
show you the part that goes beyond 8
though because that will not be
important for what I'm about to explain
the interesting part here is is this one
here because object number 3 has size 4
and value 5 which means that we can
achieve value 5 actually by putting in
this object instead of using a and B as
we did in the row before let's go to Row
4 because in Row 4 I can show you
something very interesting first values
are is that are actually not that
interesting so remember that in this row
here row number 4 we now have available
to us object a object B object C and
object D if we were to go through the
whole table how efficiently can we fill
out this table and now that we have D
available here in row number 4 I can
show you something very interesting
because you can fill out this table
quite efficiently now here we are in the
column labeled 7 which means we want to
achieve a value of 7 how can we achieve
a value of 7 so we already know that we
can achieve a value of 7 using these
three objects ABC because we have this
row here now what are the different
possibilities of achieving a value of 7
we could either do this through the row
above because we know that we can
he would using objects a B and C so it
could be a row above we could also try
to take D directly but D has a value of
four so here that's not possible so take
the new object and finally there's only
a third possibility here well since D
has a value of four we could try to
achieve a value of three using the
objects we had in there before and then
add D to it so add D to another set and
that is the set of size three and we
know just from looking at this table
here that with size two we can already
achieve a value of three D has a value
of four and it has a size of five so 2
plus 5 is 7 which is actually now the
same as this one here but of course you
would be taking the minimum of the
required sizes so here we would enter as
7 the interesting part is this in order
to fill this cell here we do not need to
go through all possible combinations of
the objects that we have we just need to
consider three cases each of which can
be calculated in constant time if we
have the row previous to the row that
we're trying to fill out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
