half the intensity at some given pixel
logically you'd set the pixels channel
values to be half that of the originals
this is certainly a reasonable idea and
in fact I recommend it once you have
your system set up properly the only
problem is that displays do not actually
respond to channel settings in this way
a monitor has a power-law response to an
input signal if you send a signal us 8.5
you get a result down here you send a
signal of one double it you get way more
than double the result this nonlinear
response a monitor sounds like something
that should just get fixed but it's in
fact a feature it turns out that our
eyes have a similar response curve a
monitor has a limited number of levels
of color it can display to get good
coverage of levels that the eye can
detect it's a fine thing to have space
these levels out in this nonlinear way
however we usually think we're
calculating colors in a linear space if
I compute a color that's half is intense
I expect to see that result many
applications ignore this mismatch
between how to calculate color and how
to display it and it's less noticeable
than you might think if everything you
do is in this space then you often don't
feel anything wrong it's what you're
used to seeing in fact I'll warn you
that many of the shader program examples
in this unit lively ignore this problem
since the focus is on keeping the
program simple however there are a few
important places where computing in the
monitor space can cause problems first
lights don't add up correctly if you
have two spotlights overlapping this
area of overlap will not be twice the
intensity as the individual spotlit
areas if you want to be more physically
based and be able to trust that your
virtual world has some connection to the
real world you need to add the lights
together sensibly the hues of colors can
shift as you vary the intensity the
channels shift in a nonlinear fashion
and so shift the perceived hue
anti-aliasing won't look as good say you
have a white polygon on a black
background if a pixel is half covered by
a polygon it should be half the
intensity is one fully covered by the
polygon if no corrections made for the
monitors nonlinear response the half
covered pixel will be dimmer this error
will cause even highly sampled pixels to
be wrong and give what's called braiding
a roping along the edges I say this a
lot but you really owe it to yourself to
see the additional course materials for
a comparison MIT mapped textures will
appear dimmer in the distance the
simplest case is the MIT map for a
two-by-two checkerboard pattern
the one by one average mipmap is a great
level of point five but as I've said
maybe five times now this gray will
appear darker on the screen this can
cause textures with high contrast to
look dimmer as these lower resolution
