and I are going to be answering your
questions well Peter will be answering
the questions I'll be asking the
questions every week we're going to take
the questions that you asked in the
forums and so far we've seen a lot of
really good stuff so I hoping the weeks
to come you guys keep coming to the
forums and keep asking such great
questions the first question comes from
project and he's a high school student
who actually lives in the Silicon Valley
area he wants to know when you're about
to tackle a new problem how much
research do you do do you look for
methods that have already been written
or do you generally just write these
tools yourself and how do you balance
that trade-off of research time verse
time spent writing okay that's a great
question project and it is important
part of being a programmer is knowing
what you should do yourself and what you
should take advantage of what other
people have already done I like to think
of it it at two levels so one is the low
level tools so the the built-in
functions and data types like strings
and sets and dictionaries that are part
of Python and there you just got to
learn what's available and and keep on
learning and reminding yourself of
exactly what all the functionality is so
the the core functionality how you
access the element of a list that you're
going to know by heart pretty soon but
there's lots of individual methods of
like how you count up how many items are
in a list and so on and you may not
remember all those so you'll be looking
at the documentation constantly looking
things up and saying what methods are
available on this type and then the the
second part is for much larger pieces of
codes say you want a web server or you
want to be able to parse and respond to
email and those are the types of things
where you expect hey somebody else has
done that before that's a big job I
probably don't have to do it and then
you start searching and you find the
right module that that implements what
you need so programming is always this
combination of what do you have to do
yourself and what do you find that
people have already done that you can
incorporate into your solution mark
sanders ask the next question and he had
some concerns with the difficulty level
of the class
particularly in the solution videos
often he'll he'll write some code that
may be solved it one way and he finds
that your solution maybe involves
functions that he's never seen before
what you have to say to students who are
experiencing this kind of thing so mark
thanks for that question and I know
other people in the forums had similar
types of questions and you know what I
want to say to you is everyone chill out
you've all got this if you've made it
through cs101 you know everything you
need to know to answer all the problems
in this class now I think that there's
this misperception that and maybe this
is you know so the way school has
traditionally been done that students
think that there's one correct answer
and you're measured by how close you
come to the teachers answer and in this
class that's not the way things work at
all in this class what you're what I'm
trying to get you to do is to grapple
with a problem come up with a solution
and then analyze alternatives for how it
might be done differently so if you have
the problem and you come up with a
solution and it solves the problem then
you've got it that's a hundred percent
correct pat yourself on the back don't
worry about how anybody else solved it
you did the job and I know you can do it
you've got all the background you need
full stop now after you've done it now
it's time to introspect a little and
i'll talk about the way i did it and my
way of doing it might be different than
yours and if you think my way is
interesting or has something novel to
show that you didn't think of before
then you could say huh you know maybe
next time I'll do it that way but that
doesn't take away from your solution
your solution is is still fine but now
you've learned a new trick you know
a new tool to add to your arsenal that
maybe next time you can use and I'll let
you in on a secret every advanced
feature that's in a programming language
is there because somebody suffered in
the past somebody tried to write it out
the long way and it took a really long
time and they said gee there's got to be
a better way and then we put the better
way into the language you've got to
understand why this is in the language
now if I just told you ahead of time
here's a new feature this is part of the
language you wouldn't get it to the
degree you would if you see why it's
there because you suffered without it
and that's the way this course works and
I know it might be different from what
you're used to before where your spoon
fed everything you need to know ahead of
time and maybe that's how school works
in some cases but it's not how the real
world works so don't get frustrated
that's the way the class is supposed to
work if you have a solution that works
no matter how you did it then that's
fine that's perfect that's a hundred
percent correct solution and then after
that you can start learning about
alternative ways to do thanks so Serge
had a question about how to value I
guess the clarity of a certain solution
or the beauty of a certain solutions so
how do you when you're presenting with
two choices for code both equally
correct and even equally efficient how
do you evaluate which one is better than
the other so a great question surge
you're right that the first thing you
want to think about is have I solved the
problem do I have it correct once you do
then efficiency is another issue and
sometimes efficiency is important for a
lot of the types of problems we're
dealing with efficiency is not important
because all the solutions will be fast
enough I think that's a minor part of
the conversation the more important part
of the conversation is the one you're
having with programmers and that's other
programmers who are reading your code
and with yourself as you start
developing and and working with your
code over time so you want to hold up
your end of the conversation you want to
have a
to be clear express exactly what you
need to say and have that all work out
so one of the rules i use is we're all
good at communicating in English or in
our native language whatever it is so if
the code can look like that then we know
we're going to be successful in our
communication so we talked about well
what's the best poker hand well the best
poker hand is the one that's the maximum
according to the hand rake and to the
extent in which i can write my code
sound exactly like that english sentence
then i think that that code is clear
there's a one-to-one mapping between the
English description and the code
description now Serge you mentioned
length and the length of a conversation
can can help clarity of communication or
it can hurt it if I go on and talk and
talk and talk and talk and you start to
get bored then I failed in my
communication so having a program that's
too long can be a problem similarly if
you ask me a complicated question and I
give you a two-word answer I may have
failed to communicate that I may not
have given you enough context so that
you understand my answer even if my
answer was technically correct so a
program can fail to communicate because
it's too short as well and you've got to
learn to have good taste to say yes for
my audience this is the right length
this speaks to them and tells them all
they need to know with just the right
amount of context to get it right Claire
done had a question and she's interested
in this top-down problem-solving
approach that we used in unit 1 and so
what I mean by that is we're often
defining functions even pretending to
use functions that don't exist so when
you define the poker function you
reference the hand right right hand rank
function even though we haven't written
that yet right what what can you say
about the advantages of this approach to
problem-solving versus the bottom of
approach where we would first build up
all the pieces and then use those pieces
in the poker function so we know when
we're finished with our program we've
got a complete structure and it's got a
top and a bottom so there's a top level
function that you call and then
going to call subroutines that's why
they could they're called subroutines
cuz they're below and and they've all
got to work in order for your program to
work now the question is in what order
do you address them and I think a lot of
that depends on the domain and depends
on where you're clear and where your
uncertainty is so if we have a
description of the domain that we
understand then it makes a lot of sense
to start from the top but I you know I
gave the example of saying well what's
the best poker hand it's the one that
has the maximum hand rank and that's a
high level statement and it assumes that
we know how to rank a hand and I think
that's a quite a reasonable assumption
if you don't understand what's going on
then sometimes it makes more sense to
start down at the bottom and build your
way up to say what are the pieces of the
domain how do they fit together let me
play with them a little bit and then
I'll think of a good way to put them
together so you can go in both
directions top down and bottom up and it
depends on your current state of
understanding but I think the key here
maybe that that Claire wasn't used to is
never be if a afraid to engage in
wishful thinking to say if only I had a
function that did the right thing then I
could proceed and you should always be
willing to proceed that way and one last
question so you were once a student of
computer science yourself and I'm sure
there were methods that were helpful for
you in learning kind of code what can
you what kind of advice can you give to
current students of computer science I
should say I think you guys are doing
great and you know it's so much easier
for you than it was for me when when I
was learning and part of the reason is
that that so much is more accessible now
so I started before there was an
internet so you couldn't just do a
google search and find results secondly
I didn't know in a computer those were
big expensive things that individuals
didn't own and so you had to go to the
computer center and use the machines
that were there and it was just
inconvenient and hard to do that now one
of the the good advantages of doing that
was that meant I was in the same room
with other people and so you got a
chance to to talk with your colleagues
and friends and learn from them so I
would encourage you to keep doing that
to keep finding other people to bounce
ideas off of and learn from them but
then you're in such a great position now
to to learn so much more quickly and
from what I've seen from briefly
observing 101 and from what I've seen in
this class you guys are off to a great
start and you know it took me years to
get to the level where you guys are just
starting out so key so keep it up thanks
for the answers and thank you all for
the great questions we'll see you again
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
