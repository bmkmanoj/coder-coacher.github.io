interesting that that we learned on
reddit over the years was you know in
the beginning we just had a small amount
of content but as we grew the content
kind of turned into two flavors not just
you know hot versus you know saved it
was kind of new versus old and the
content was you know if you go to your
profile page that content isn't accessed
very often before we did the pre
computing thing you know our hot pages
were highly optimized the queries are
fast everything worked nicely it was
cached perfectly but somebody would hit
a user page that hadn't been accessed in
a month you have not so much just stale
cold dad that's not any cache and the
whole system just like chugs to bring
that out and so that's when we started
pre computing those and you guys are
taking it to the next level
right and one one thing we actually do
there is there's a special comment
comments the really bad one there's just
so many comments so much data those
databases get overloaded especially when
you know you pull up an old an old
comment page from two years ago nobody's
seen it in like three months and it has
to load 500 comments and that's a disk
hit for every one of those so we
actually have a dedicated comment slave
that is just for the likes of Google
like there's a whole a whole separate
stack for Google yeah
and it's read-only and yeah I would draw
a picture but basically I think we
started adding this just as I was
leaving there's a whole separate set of
databases and app servers maybe one app
server two or three and a couple app
servers that just for Google because
Google will come through and index
everything and read it gets a lot of
traffic these days from Google yeah you
can take any you know two word
combination off the front page of Reddit
do a google search for it and they'll be
in the top ten and that's because Google
is just murdered and so we had to build
a whole separate infrastructure just for
Google so that they would because they
hit the site on a completely different
way from users yeah in a way that it's
really hard to cache for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
