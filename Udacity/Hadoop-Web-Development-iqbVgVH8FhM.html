mysterious person who's not here he
wrote a MapReduce system by hand is that
great yes
and you guys are now replacing that with
so we're switching over to Hadoop using
a language called Pig or Pig Latin and
Hadoop is a MapReduce system and it has
the advantage of handling all the
details of distributing these mappers
and reducers across a cluster of nodes
and we're actually using Amazon's
elastic MapReduce which is hosted Hadoop
to make our lives simpler so yeah so one
of the cool things about Amazon we
talked and previously in this lecture
about AWS the Amazon Web Services this
Amazon has you know built in you know
not just machines but this this whole
hadoop clusters that you can Commission
and pay for so you guys are moving to
that we actually use those that have
mocking out to for our log analysis nice
and it's really cool because you can
just basically put in queries and say
here's my data we actually store our
data and that's three of these big text
files we just say run this query using
you know 20 machines yeah over all this
data and you can basically say like how
many was like biscuit how long do I want
to wait an Amazon will bring up all the
machines load your data in run the job
I'll put it and then shut all the
machines down yeah that's pretty great
oh so you guys are gonna be running
MapReduce constantly though right right
and every 15 minutes or something yeah
that's an interesting question of how to
do that with EMR I mean you can do it
and yeah we just need to set it up right
okay so you say you're still kind of
figuring out how that's yeah that's and
that's gonna compute be like the hot
pages for every reddit it's mostly user
pages but there are a few other things
it's stuff like you know your top links
of this hour or that kind of stuff
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
