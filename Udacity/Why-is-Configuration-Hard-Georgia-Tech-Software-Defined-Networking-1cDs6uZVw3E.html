right first it's difficult to define
what we mean by correct behavior in the
first place second the interactions
between multiple routing protocols can
lead to unpredictability furthermore
each autonomous system on the Internet
is independently configured and the
interaction between the policies of
these autonomous systems can lead to
unintended or unwanted behavior the
third reason that configuration is hard
is that operators simply make mistakes
configuration is difficult and network
policies are very complex furthermore
network configuration has historically
been distributed across hundreds or more
network devices across the network where
each device is configured with vendor
specific low-level configuration we'll
see in the first part of this course how
Software Defined Networking or Sdn
changes this by centralizing the
network's configuration in a logically
centralized controller and a very
high-level Software Defined Networking
provides exactly the primitives that
operators need to run the network better
in particular
Sdn provides operators three things the
first is Network wide views of both
topology and traffic the second is the
ability to satisfy network level
objectives such as those that we talked
about before including load balance
security and other high-level goals the
third thing that Software Defined
Networking provides that network
operators need is direct control in
particular rather than requiring network
operators to configure each device
individually with indirect configuration
Sdn allows an operator to write a
control program that directly effects
the data plane so rather than having to
configure each device individually and
guess or infer what might happen suffer
Defined Networking allows a network
hopper
to express network level objectives and
direct control from a logically
centralized controller so to make
network operations easier routers should
forward packets since router hardware is
specialized to forward traffic at very
high rates they should collect
measurements such as traffic statistics
and topology information but on the
other hand there's no reason that a
router should have to compute routes
although conventionally routing has
operated as a distributed computation of
forwarding tables the computation
doesn't inherently need to run on the
routers rather the computation could be
logically centralized and controlled
from a centralized control program this
logical centralization is the
fundamental tenant of Sdn so a simple
way of summing up software-defined
networking is simply to remove routing
from the routers and perform that
routing computation at a logically
centralized controller now of course Sdn
has evolved to incorporate a much
broader range of controls than simply
routing decisions and we'll talk about
the range of control that Sdn
controllers enable in today's networks
