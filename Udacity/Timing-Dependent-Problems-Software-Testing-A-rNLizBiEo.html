software under test and it provides some
api's EGP is collection of functions and
most of the work that we have during
testing is going to be calling these
functions with various values and
looking at the results
additionally the software under test is
going to use api is provided by for
example the operating system or the
programming language runtime and a
separate kind of testing is looking at
how the software under test responds to
return codes and similar given to it by
the api's that he uses that would be
great if both of these kinds of testing
represented a complete picture of
everything that we need to test but in
fact that's not the case and there's
some added complications we're going to
talk about now and the issue is that the
overt explicit interfaces that we see
here don't represent all the possible
inputs and outputs that we might care
about for example on the input side it's
completely possible that our software
under test cares about the time at which
inputs arrive so it might be the case
that our software responds differently
if our inputs if two inputs arrive very
close together then it does if two
inputs are I've separated by a large
amount of time if this seems silly just
consider for example the software the
process is mouse clicks - clicks very
close together represent a double click
and that's interpreted very differently
from two mouse clicks that occur far up
farther apart in time which count as two
single mouse clicks in another example
is something like a web browser where if
the data corresponding to a web page is
returned in a short window of time this
data will get rendered as a web page but
if the data that comes from the network
is scattered across too much time this
is going to result in some sort of a
timeout that is to say the software
under test which is our web browser will
render some sort of an error page
instead of actually rendering the data
if it comes too slowly now both of these
examples that we just looked at are
fairly easy to test because in each case
we have this sort of binary distinction
between in one case the data arriving
quickly that is to say a double-click or
a complete web page arriving before the
timeout and in the other case we have
data arriving too slowly that is to say
to single clicks or a web page that
takes so long to arrive
we timeout in other cases the time
timing-dependent input can make our
lives significantly more complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
