gender it exists there are cultures
across the globe where there are three
genders in Thailand for example there
there are three genders in in certain
Native American groups or indigenous
groups to the Americas there are four
genders in parts of China there are
older communities that have five genders
and when we think about that from a
binary gender lens it's almost
impossible to wrap our mind around it
until we start to really realize and we
think about our own gender and we think
well gosh some days I feel very
masculine you know maybe when I'm at
work maybe I have a job where I'm
surrounded by a lot of men maybe I do
construction yet I happen to have a
breast and and a vulva but I don't
really feel like a woman in that context
because I'm not really doing things that
are very stereotypically feminine I kind
of feel masculine but then then when I
go home and I have my male partner and I
have children I feel very feminine I'm
mothering I feel like a woman and so
when we start to think about gender is
something that is fluid throughout the
day as something that varies from place
to place on the globe and it's different
across time I mean the concepts of this
gender binary
pink blue society that we have in the
United States for example really didn't
really emerge until you know the 1900s
that that really is a new concept and
really with the advent of this pink blue
thing that was like the 1950s and so in
asking what gender is really we need to
ask ourselves what is gender to me and
what is gender to you and how is that
solar and how is it different and we
really should be mindful not to make
assumptions which is why I really
encourage like the therapists I work
with now to ask people you know how do
you gender identify or ijen deride enta
Phi as as a girl and as a woman and
please use the pronoun she and her
because we can't make assumptions for
example some people might feel very
untraditional where they have a mixed
feeling of being masculine and feminine
maybe they prefer the gender pronoun of
they and them so we just can't
and I think that's exciting I mean I
think the idea that gender can be and is
constructed in multitudes of ways that
we can't even really grok is kind of
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
