first polynomial factor X plus 5 treated
as a block and it is multiplying each of
the terms inside the second set of
parentheses so the next step is to apply
the distributive property once again we
know that we would rearrange each of
these terms so that the factor X plus 5
comes after the factors that only have
one term inside them and then once we
got here we would use the distributive
property again to simplify for each of
these terms so let's take a second and
compare what we're doing in this step of
the problem what we did in the very
first step in both cases using the
distributive property we use it the
first time so that we could set
ourselves up to do it again notice
though which numbers and variables are
written here we have an X and a negative
two and then we have an x and a positive
5 and those are just the same terms that
are in the two polynomials up here the
things that we're multiplying together
are x and x x and x x + 5 x + 5 negative
2 and x negative 2 and x + 5 and
negative 2 what we've done here using
the distributive property is just make
sure that every term in the first
polynomial is multiplied by every term
in the second polynomial here we've
reached another point where we can use a
sort of shortcuts that we don't have to
do quite as many steps in the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
