first thing I want to do is add a button
somewhere here in my app the way to do
this is to look in the utility area in
here at the bottom is this button called
show the object library I'm going to
click on it and now I have access to a
whole bunch of different user interface
elements things like a button a slider
and many others now I can look at them
in this list format or I can click on
this little button here and see the icon
view there it is
I can even search for things I want like
a button in this case and there's the
element I want so I'm going to drag this
button on to the editor and use these
blue lines as a guide for dropping it
into the center of the canvas there I
can change the text of this button to
let's say record I can also change the
width and the height of this button
there now one good practice here is to
go to the editor menu at the top and
click on size to fit content this way
the button will automatically change its
size as you type in it there let me drag
this in the center one more time done
now once you've selected the button I
want you to click on this tiny little
icon here which is called
the attributes inspector if you click on
it it will present to you a whole bunch
of different options that can help you
change the well the attributes of the
button you can change the text here the
font here and a whole bunch of different
options that we will tinker with soon
all right so for now what I want to do
is I want to run my app and see if this
button even shows up on the app the way
to do this is to use something called a
simulator which is our way to run the
app without needing a hardware device at
the top here you will notice a list of
simulators that are available I'm going
to use iPhone 5s and that's because this
simulator fits really well on my
recording screen you could have used
iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus for that
matter then I'm going to click on this
play button to run the app notice that
the simulator may take a while to load
up when you run it for the first time
all right so there's our simulator and
there's the button in
side the simulator although it's not
quite in the center yet and that is
somewhat bothersome but I will fix that
in the next video for now I can click on
it and nothing happens because we
haven't programmed the button to do
anything just yet as a quick aside you
can go to the window menu here at the
top and change the scale to make sure
that the phone fits really well on your
computer screen this is a little bit too
big for me so I'm going to keep the
scale at 50% there also if you go to the
hardware menu at the top you can rotate
your phone left you can rotate it right
and you can go to the home screen
there's our app pitch-perfect alright so
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to fix this button so it shows up
in the center of the phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
