I'm gonna show you how to build a
parameterised model from data what do I
mean by parameterised model this is an
example of a parameterised model that
you're probably familiar with from
algebra it's a function of X and it has
these two parameters m and B in fact as
you're probably aware this is the
equation of a line so m and b are the
parameters of that line now for
convenience in our code instead of using
M and B I'm going to use C 0 and C 1
just to be consistent let me motivate
this with an example let's suppose we
have some data from an experiment now
this can work for many sorts of
experiments but for now let's assume
we've taken some measurements of
humidity and we've observed on those
particular days we measure the humidity
how much it rains so each dot here
represents one day in one sample of data
so on this date it was this humid and it
rained that much and we probably have
lots more data one for each day when we
look at this data we see there's a kind
of relationship here and our intuition
is maybe that it could be fitted by a
line just sort of by eyeballing it looks
like the line might look about like that
and so our parameters here coefficient 0
is equivalent to the slope here and
coefficient 1 is the y-intercept so our
task is to find C sub 0 and C sub 1 that
provide the equation for this line that
best fits the data the question here is
how do we reframe this problem so that
it makes sense for our minimizer what is
it we're trying to minimize so restating
the problem suppose we have our original
data points here and we're trying to
discover the
equation of a line that best fits those
points suppose this blue line is a
candidate line and we want to evaluate
it is this good or bad so the equation
for that line is our first coefficient
times X plus the second coefficient and
what the minimizer is going to do is
it's going to vary this c0 and c1 to try
and minimize something and so we have to
come up with an equation that gets a
lower in value as this line better fits
the data what should we use for that
equation so here's one step towards
solving this problem we can take a look
at each one of our original data points
and observe how far away it is from this
line that we're evaluating let's call
each of these distances e so E sub 0 is
that one
yi sub 1 is that one can we come up with
an equation in terms of E or error that
gets us to this solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
