projects is very customer led so what
we've created is a development kit where
you can buy our actuator modules on
assemblies that you can kind of snap
together with as many actuators as you
need as many actuators sizes as you need
in whatever orientation that you want at
your facility with your product and you
you know your engineering team can start
to explore you know what is the exact
configuration of the system that best
satisfies what what you need to do
because ultimately you understand your
product the best you know how your
product works you know how its presented
to the robot you know what the packaging
looks like and so when they're when
they're done doing that development
process they can then contact us and say
you know this is the design that we came
up with and we'll take that design and
we'll convert it into a version that is
very very robust for an industrial
environment we also do our own internal
gripper development for you know for
projects and problems that we're
incredibly excited about and often the
way that development process works is
you go to the store so you go to a
supermarket or you go to a toy store or
you go to an e-commerce fulfillment site
start buying piles of objects so you
take the the things that you just bought
you start you know building Xillia
different grippers trying to see what
are the grass parameters that the drive
quality of the grass you also start
playing around with you know the control
systems that we build you know the the
pneumatic control systems to figure out
what sort of you know pneumatic profiles
deliver the best quality in an
application and you kind of build up
build up build up from there until you
have the finalized concept so my dates
off robotics typically focuses on the
actuators themselves you know since this
is a brand new field of science and
engineering there's a lot of things that
that need to be worked out so even
building an actuator a sophisticated
actuator requires inventing the
prototyping methods that then create the
thing that you want to even test in the
first place so that's a piece of it
understanding how to simulate elastomers
for example is a
in ever increasingly sophisticated
science and you know new software's
coming out all the time and it's it's
driving the quality of the simulations
but that's a thing and you know once
you've done the prototyping and the
simulation in your building you know a
couple of parts that generate the sort
of physical behaviors are trying to
create for a customer you then need to
do the process of you know starting to
scale up to manufacturing starting to
build out what would be the the bulk
manufacturing processes that can create
the things that you just prototyped up
in lab and making sure that they meet
all the sorts of functional and you know
functional performance tests that you
want it to have hit so you know does it
last long enough is it easily abraded
you know is it easy to make
you know because ultimately unlike the
stuff that people typically build in lab
you know you need to pump out thousands
ten thousand hundred thousands you know
millions of these actuators so you need
to be able to you know drive it through
that whole process and so that's what
what I focus heavily on but in order to
build soft you know soft robotics
systems that are sophisticated and truly
satisfy a customer's needs where in our
case that typically means being able to
manipulate complex objects very quickly
in a way that is extremely reproducible
so the standards in industrial
automation is essentially that you get
it right all day every day all years
otherwise you shut down a factory line
which is an incredible cost so being
able to go from you know hobbyist work
to systems that deliver that level of
precision and accuracy requires not just
soft robotic actuators but a whole
marriage of systems you know the
pneumatics the Matic control systems the
AI software you name it if it's in a
conventional robot it's in what we do
plus having to also understand the all
the different new aspects of soft
actuators simulations are never perfect
we all anyone who's run the simulation
knows that and when you run experiments
even if the experiment works you never
always completely glean everything that
was relevant about what just happened
you can actually miss a lot of insights
if you don't have simulation so you know
doing fast iteration through simulation
followed by fast iteration through
experiment and marching forward like
that's always best
you know personally in all the work that
I do now as far as simulating the
industrial environments it's very common
in industry to have factory workflow
simulation software where you have your
conveyor you have your robot you have
you know whatever is the process you're
trying to mock up so that you can
understand all the things that are
creating choke points for rates and you
know to create a very very streamlined
Factory and you know we we build
gripping solutions but factories are a
whole myriad of different kinds of
technologies so that's the simulation
that they do as far as the simulation
that we do for the most part the
simulation focus heavily on the
actuators themselves so there are a lot
of things that you can learn
computationally about how different
patterning of plastics and elastomers or
multiple different kinds of elastomers
where you have variable stiffness all
over the body and other you know
mechanical properties of materials it's
a lot easier often or a lot more
efficient to kind of get a first pass
about what that actuator is going to do
and you know an FAA style simulation
space and then iterate from there with
physical versions of the actuator moving
you know in increasing sophistication
and how you build the actuator and how
you run the the simulation model and so
that creates deep insights that we
worked really hard to build here and it
creates a very very rapid development
