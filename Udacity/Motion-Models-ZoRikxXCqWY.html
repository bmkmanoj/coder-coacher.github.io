these are the same transformations that
we talked about earlier when we're
talking about doing mappings for
homography sand panoramas and things
like that so we have very simple so
we're basically go from the red to the
the green so if we have a translation
right so this thing just move that way
and in a translation how many unknowns
are there 22 right so since we get two
equations for each point we just need to
track one point tier one point there if
I know that between them I know how to
exchange I know why changed two
equations two unknowns great
everything's good we have some what's
called a similarity transform similarity
is where things can translate rotate and
scale all right and that's four unknowns
two points we should think about it if I
take a stick here I could translate it
rotate and stretch it I only need two
points to know the translation rotation
and stretch much more interesting is
what's referred to as a fine i have this
rectangle and when i move it I can
translate rotate skew alright and so
parallel lines remain parallel and I
have six unknowns and and there's we
actually looked at the math before one
way thing about it is I take one
triangle and I map it to its
corresponding triangle and that's an
affine transform so there's six unknowns
and I can solve it with three points and
then finally I know you're all waiting
for this right here it's written as
perspective we can also write this as
homography now you're seeing why we
don't have me writing anything we did
this before right we said if we have
perspective projection of a plane to
another plane that that transformation
is a four-point transformation eight
unknowns and that's because it takes
four and four points therefore to
recover homography so each of these can
be thought of as transformations or as
motions within a region</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
