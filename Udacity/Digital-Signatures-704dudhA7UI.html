that the public key component is really
public that is any user can send his or
her public key to any other user or just
broadcast it to the world although this
approach is very convenient it has a
major weakness that is anyone can forge
such a public announcement some user
could pretend to be Bob and send a
public key to another user such as Alice
and tell is that this is Bob's public
key the result is that when Alice sends
a private message to Bob say she
encrypts it using Bob's public key but
remember this Bob's public key is
actually forged by the attacker then the
message can be intercepted by the
attacker and can be read by the attacker
now at some point hopefully Bob can
discover that there's a forgery going on
and a fake public key of his was being
used but then what can Bob do but can
send Alice another message saying that
hey this is my real public key but how
could Alice tell that is how could a
leased out that the previous key was a
forgery and this key that Bob descent is
will the solution to this problem of
public key forgery is to use a public
key certificate in essence a certificate
consists of Bob's public key and pops
information such as the user ID let's
say his name and address and so on the
certificate authorities information and
whole blog is signed using the
certificate authorities private key the
certificate can also include other
information such as the period of
validity of this certificate that is for
how long this certificate is valid for
this public key say one year now let's
see how certificate is created and how
it is verified and how it is being used
to distribute public key suppose Bob
wants the certificate authority CA to
create a certificate for his public key
Bob will contact the CA and provide
authentication information such his
driver's license and so on and then he
would send his public key to CA the CA
will then oops ID his public key
other information such as the period of
validity together and then hash it and
then the CA will use his private key to
sign the hash so that creates the
certificate of Bob's public key now Bob
can send this public key certificate to
anybody such as Alice when Alice
receives this public key certificate she
can first extract the cria tax
information of Bob's ID public key and
other information and then should we
hash this data and then Alice would also
use the certificate authorities public
key to decrypt the signature or verify
the signature and compare these two hash
values if they match that means this
public key has been properly signed by
the CA in other words this public key of
Bob's has been validated by the CA so
this is how public key certificate works
now of course the underlying assumption
is that the CA is a trusted party by
everybody involved in practice the CA is
a well-known company such as Verisign
Microsoft Google or Apple and the public
keys are already stored in for example
your web browser that is with these
public keys already configured on your
system they can automatically validate
public key certificates signed by these
entities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
