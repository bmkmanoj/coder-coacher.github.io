useful for running code once our view
controller is loaded into memory what
about running some code right before the
view appears on screen for that there
are two functions we can use V will
appear and viewed it appear will appear
happens right before the view and view
controller appear on screen and did
appear gets called immediately after the
view and view controller appear on
screen remember that the view and view
controller are linked a uiviewcontroller
and any subclasses of it have at least
one iboutlet that always goes to a
uiview here we're going to use
autocomplete to help us out in the view
controller swift file move right to the
bottom in the space directly above the
last closing curly brace start typing
view will you can see Xcode autocomplete
showing us the view will appear function
it knows that view controller is a
subclass of UI view controller it also
knows in UI view controller there's a
function you can override called
viewwillappear clicking on this function
fills it in for us autocomplete make
sure that the function name and
parameters are correct there's no typos
see the highlighted text here that says
code click on it this is what we're
going to type our code for now let's add
the line viewwillappear called if we run
this app by pressing the run button we
can see the print statement being called
when our view controller appears on
screen there it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
