myself a Bay Area native I grew up in
Fremont and I'm a genetic counselor and
technically I guess my title is
perinatal genetic counselors so I focus
on patients who are pregnant or thinking
about pregnancy and as a genetic
counselor are there sub disciplines like
our I mean are there genetic counselors
who focus on sort of the non perinatal
aspect certainly so this profession
still pretty new i think in the
beginning there weren't that many
specialties it was either pediatrics
children and an prenatal was a second i
think as soon as pregnancy test started
and since then there are several
different specialties the big ones are
pediatrics prenatal cancer has become
the hot new thing counselors who work in
a laboratory and then specialty
counselors who work in certain
disciplines like cardiology or neurology
or please some kind of training was
involved so once you've figured out
that's something you wanted what do you
do to become a genetic counselor
officially so it's very specific so it's
usually a two or three-year master's
program specifically in genetic
counseling so all the courses are geared
towards the science of genetics and
counseling theory and so right now I
just did the steps I think they're about
30 programs nationwide so there are
three in California and then in other
states and so you still have to apply
take standard testing like gres is still
around and do some training like
volunteering in health care settings so
I volunteered at Planned Parenthood for
a year I see during the pregnancy test
school and then applied what are the
various backgrounds do all genetic
counselors have the same academic
training or do they have diverse
academic training so yeah and so
counselors come from a wide variety of
backgrounds they do have in common that
they have to have a master's degree and
the master's degree programs require an
undergraduate usually four-year college
but and some prerequisites science
courses biology chemistry but other than
that you can be any major so my
classmate was a psychology major I was a
genetics major
some people were completely not really
used to either specialty as long as I
finish their courses what do you think
about the profession itself overall as
it says in a profession that's growing a
number and and how is it growing if it
is so yeah the profession itself
definitely is growing in number i don't
have year by year but i think in the
very beginning i think the first
national society started in the late 70s
and then there are probably 10 to 30
members maybe and now i think we're up
to past 2000 nation wise in the state
i'm organizing this conference coming up
so i just did some stats in this state
there's probably about 400 licensed
genetic counselors so just to give our
perspective of we're still a small
specialty but definitely growing is I
guess this is sort of more of the
personal side but I mean is do you like
being a genetic counselor do you feel
like you're helping people what what
aspect of doing this job is probably the
best and most fulfilling for you I think
it's a combination of things like this
job definitely I I really enjoy being a
genet Cal so it really fits my niche
that it combines my interest in my love
of science and specifically genetics and
genetic conditions with seeing patients
helping people in a healthcare setting
so I've been thinking about some of
these answers that you know the
traditional role for health care
professional is a doctor but doctors
have a lot of stress a lot of schooling
doing treatments and procedures and I
wasn't necessarily interested in that
part I was really more interested in
communicating to patients and feeling
like I could help them just using my
words or just being there for them and
listening to them so I really feel that
this profession has been a really good
fit for for me and my personality so a
lot of what I do is I think of it as a
consultation but also just providing
information I see us as a link between
physicians and patients that
traditionally doctors ordered tests that
are fairly straightforward like a blood
count or a blood type or something like
that and they can easily tell a patient
what that means in a sentence with this
genetic testing it's much more
complicated than that it's not always a
straightforward yes or no and doctors
don't have time to spend with patients
explaining that and so I see us as a
ridge between that being able to help
patients decipher and interpret this
information and then also helping them
make decisions based on those results
because a lot of decisions to be made
especially in pregnancy are not always
medical decisions their personal
decisions about what patients want to do
about information about their future
offspring so so prenatal specifically is
an interesting ethical realm because
we're also dealing with pregnancy and
and termination you do pedigrees don't
you yes we do we always do pedigrees
it's kind of our shorthand for gathering
medical advice are you good how fast can
you like draw petting okay I'm pretty
fun people my colleagues would say I'm
too fast at a lot of things so I'm
pretty fast at drawing pedigree we have
colleagues I don't have the template
that hat they used to have a template
that you could trace a pedigree and so I
had colleagues who could without that
template and do the the rotation and
things but most of us can draw freehand
pretty well but now there are programs
that also draw pedigrees because mine
are fairly basic I take maybe three
generations of pedigrees so patients
their children and their parents some
pedigrees like for cancer where you're
really trying to pinpoint all the
individuals with cancer those pedigrees
could get huge and then I think the
counselors definitely need help with a
program that can kind of line things up
and sort things out have you ever had to
look at a trait or I don't know I'm just
curious have you ever looked at a trait
with their what no one knows what the
inheritance pattern is like you
ever discovered a new one here does none
of what does that happen as a genetic
counselor you ever looking at traits
that no one's ever described before so
that's kind of two separate questions so
that looking at a pedigree sometimes we
don't know the inheritance like it
doesn't fit a traditional dominant or
doesn't fit a traditional recessive so
that's kind of the fun part of our job
where it's a rare occurrence of
something happening so it's not I don't
think we've discovered a new inheritance
but we've discovered new instances of it
rare rare instances of things that can
happen with traditional inheritance
patterns so that's that's one way like
something happens on top of something
else and that's what gives that pattern
and then we can also be fooled when
people are related to each other because
then that throws things because it could
be a dominant trait but if there's
relatives that are related to each other
it could be recessive as well and then
your other question just about I mean we
certainly have conditions that nobody's
described before and we see it in
prenatal but we've seen more in
pediatrics where child comes to us with
a unique set of symptoms and that's not
been described and so that that's a cool
part of a pediatric genetics counselor
or doctor's job is they might actually
identify a new syndrome so I haven't
personally been part of that but my
colleagues actually have and we know
physicians who have discovered new
conditions and have had them named after
them yeah that's crazy that's pretty
cool there's somebody watching right now
who's really interested and wants to
learn more about being a genetic
counselor what would you do you have any
particular good resource you tell them
to go visit or do you have any special
message you would tell them about
genetic counseling so yeah I would I
would highly recommend the profession if
anyone's thinking about genetic
counseling it's a very good combination
of medicine and healthcare and
interacting with patients so we call
that a clinical kind of job if you like
patients and if you like the specific
field of genetics because that's pretty
much what we're talking about so if you
don't like genetics I wouldn't recommend
this profession but if you want to work
with people but still be in tune with
the science it's a really good
profession there are a lot of counselors
who work part-time and we don't take
call like physicians or nurses and so
for those again who want to go into
medicine but don't want the extra stress
of those kinds of things it's a really
nice profession a lot of lots of
counselors work part-time again because
we're seeing patients and they can be
scheduled appointments the salaries I
think especially with our certification
and licensure hopefully are starting to
increase and there's certainly a lot of
job opportunity so I would highly
recommend checking out the website in
talking to a genetic counselor if you
can even shadowing a counselor and doing
some volunteer work in healthcare just
to make sure that's the area that they
like to be in great
a great advice thank you so much thank
you very much for the opportunity
