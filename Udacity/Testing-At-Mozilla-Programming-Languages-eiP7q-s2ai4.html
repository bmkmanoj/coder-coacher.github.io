for this let's check in with someone who
toils in the trenches of the real world
so I'm here at Mozilla with Steve Fink
and one of the topics that we cover in
class is debugging or testing making
small convenient test cases that are
going to lead us to a bug or a defect in
our program that's tricky even for small
classroom examples it can be really
difficult in the real world Steve have
you run into problems like this in your
job sure in fact right now I'm dealing
with a particular test program that went
to a great deal of effort to kind of
reimplement algorithm that its testing
which is great in terms of you know
comparing the CLS implementation and
this JavaScript test program and giving
you a yes/no answer it works it doesn't
work but if you actually do have a bug
it can be a bit of a pain tracking it
down just because okay you have a
failure somewhere in the test now you
have to figure out what the test program
is actually doing to figure out why it
made the particular invitations into the
C++ engine that resulted in the behavior
that is actually testing so in many
cases it's actually easier to just have
a brain dead simple series of call this
call this College call this rather than
you know for each of these items call
this if this is true and expect you know
this output if you know this is where
the real implementation the algorithm
comes let me give a specific example
this was a test of typed array code
if you access outside of the bounds of
the type to rate code outside the bounds
of a typed array and it should give you
arrange that yeah an exception which of
type range air and so this test programs
you just went through an array of
different possible inputs and then said
well based on this logic if this index
is higher than this number then expect a
ranger otherwise expect this value that
it you know pulled out of the array so
the actual test invocation right there
is array element I should be retrieved
from this typed array and then you
should get the result based on you know
element J of this array and it turns out
no I didn't throw the right error there
was a problem but figuring out ok so
what exact element were you looking for
and you know what did you actually
expect to find based on this other array
was very indirect very difficult it
would have been easier if it was just a
dumb simple series of statements saying
pull this element out expect this error
pull this element out expect this value
and in fact that's kind of what I plan
to do is instrument the test case itself
to generate a series of silly stupid
linear statements and you know generate
a new test case out of that and then
throw away the original because this
clever he is easy to modify as it is
it's not actually helpful when you're
trying to track down a particular bug
it's an excellent point one of the
things we cover in class you'll notice
that in class most of our test cases are
relatively small and simple and this is
good advice sometimes it's better to
have two test cases one for each feature
than to try to combine them together and
then have to tease apart in interaction
later am it also makes it much easier to
do for example binary search you can
whack off half the test file if it is a
very simple straightforward test file if
it's all interrelated then it's really
to take off half at a time exactly we'll
get a chance to see in class commenting
out parts of a test file to see if it
still causes an error in a linear test
file or just a sequence of assignments
that's much easier to do than if there's
a lot of complicated control flow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
