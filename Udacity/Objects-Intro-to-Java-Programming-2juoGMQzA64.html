programming and Java course we're going
to start our discussion with objects to
understand why you might want to know
about objects I'll consider some one
who's building a house it used to be in
the olden days that a house was built
from nothing but bricks and wood
nowadays of course a builder takes
prefabricated components such as this
furnace or this water heater and puts
them together and you can think of those
as the analog of when an object would be
in a programming language an object is a
building block of a program it is a
component with some desired
functionality just as the water heater
over here has some desired functionality
for the Builder it heats water and your
programs you ask objects to do work you
don't know how they do that and that's
okay just like if you really think about
it do you actually know how a water
heater does its job or for that matter
do you care here we have a different
kind of water heater a solar water
heater and it doesn't really matter how
a water heater works as long as it heats
water with an object what's important
what it does not how it does it now
that's all very abstract and the way one
really learns about objects is to play
with them and I'll show you how you can
play with some in blue tape</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
