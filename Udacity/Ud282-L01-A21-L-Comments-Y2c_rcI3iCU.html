for computers to understand but it's
also supposed to make sense for us
programmers to you'll most likely be
working in a team of programmers reading
others people's code while others
reading your code so it's really
important to make sure that your code
and variable names are self descriptive
but when your program gets longer and
longer things start to get confusing and
you would need a lot more than just Java
statements to explain what your program
is doing this is why Java allows you to
add notes or comments in between your
lines of code like that these lines of
code would be entirely ignored by the
computer running your program but for
anyone else reading your code it would
explain a lot to add a comment in your
code simply start the line with those
two forward slashes over here then feel
free to write whatever you want after
that usually things that would explain
the instruction that happens right after
that and when you actually run the
program computer would just ignore any
line that starts with those two forward
slashes and run the actual lines of code
in between these lines of nodes are
called comments it's a really good idea
to add as many comments as you need that
would make your code a lot more
understandable when someone else reads
it if you want to be even more
descriptive you can write a multi-line
comment by citing the first line with
this forward slash followed by the
asterisk and ending it with the s3 and
then the forward slash you can write
anything in between those two remarks in
multiple lines which means you don't
have to start every line with those two
forward slashes like before a welcome
nted code is much easier to understand
and follow make a habit of commenting
anything that might not be clear from
the code itself and trust me even
reading your own code that you haven't
seen in a while won't make any sense
without those precious comments that
explain it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
