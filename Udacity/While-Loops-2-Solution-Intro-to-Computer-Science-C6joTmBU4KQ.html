essentially run forever it won't run
till the end of the universe because
we'll probably have something else
happen to our computer before that but
there's no stopping condition for the
while loop the wild test will never
become false we start with I equals 1 we
keep increasing by 2 so the values that
I will have will be 1 3 5 7 9 11 and so
forth the loop test checks if I is equal
to 10 if I is not equal to 10 we keep
going so if I is not equal to 10 we're
gonna keep going through the loop I will
never become 10 we skip 10 the loop test
is never true that means the while loop
just keeps going forever and ever never
finishing I'll show you what happens
when we run that and I'm going to show
this running in the Python shell instead
of running through the web browser ID
that you've been using so far in the
class and the reason for that is we can
see more output we can run longer things
that the way you run the programs for
class there's a limit to how long they
can run and how big the output can be
with the shell there's no limit like
that so I can show you a longer
execution there are instructions on the
website if you want to run programs
yourself in the Python shell there are
lots of different ways to do that and
instructions for how to do that on
different platforms it is not necessary
to continue with the class but it'll
make it easier to see what's going on
here
so here's the code I'm going to enter
the code that we had so we have I is
assigned 1 and then the loop while I is
not equal to 10 we're going to increase
I by 2 and then we're gonna print I so
now when I type return one more time
this while loop will start running and
we'll see it print out the numbers and
it will keep going as long as we let it
keep going so here we go
we see 3 5 7 notes keeping going really
fast so at the top you can see the first
5 numbers started 3 5 7 9 11 since it
skipped 10 the loop didn't stop this
condition was never false and it keeps
going and it will keep going for as long
as we let it print or until our computer
runs out of memory or power so a loop
that never stops like this is what we
call an infinite
that means it keeps going forever and if
you've run programs on computers you've
probably encountered them a lot not just
in the program that you just wrote that
we just used for this quiz but often
times when your software hangs and get
stuck doing something that's what's
going on that there's some mistake that
a programmer made we call that a bug
there's a bug in the program and it's
stuck in a finit
it's never going to make any progress
it's got stuck in something where the
test condition will never be true and
it's going to keep going forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
