do I mean by ratios let's go back to our
similar triangles to figure out what I
mean now I have two triangles here
they're similar because the angles match
but the sides are different I'm gonna
label these sides little a little B and
little C and these sides big a big B
and big C and you can see that even
though these sides are all longer
there's some correspondence between side
big a inside little a likewise with the
Big C in the little C and the big B and
the little B but what exactly is that
correspondence what do these things all
have in common and the fact is they have
a ratio in common and what I mean by
that is they're linked through ratios so
if I look at the ratio of side big a to
side Big B I'm going to find that's
exactly the same as the ratio of side
little a to side little C in fact it
doesn't matter how big or small I make
this triangle this equality will always
hold true and that's a really powerful
mathematical tool that we can use so for
example let's say I didn't give you
variable names here but I gave you some
actual numbers so three meters four
meters and five meters are replacing our
size from before and these are still
unknown but let's say I told you that I
don't know side Big B was equal to 6
meters I can use this to calculate side
Big C because I know that C over Big B
has to equal will the corresponding
sides 4 over 3 more precisely 4 meters
over 3 meters and notice that when we do
this the unit's cancel out so it doesn't
even matter that we were using meters we
could have been using inches or stadia
or furlongs or any unit we'd like ok so
now I know this ratio C over B is equal
to 4 over 3 but notice that I have one
other piece of information big B is
actually equal to 6 meters so let's
write that in now if I want to solve for
C I multiply both sides by 6 meters and
that gives me the following C equals 4
over 3 times 6 meters also known as 8
okay that wasn't so bad we used the
power of ratios to calculate an unknown
side of a triangle and this is a huge
tool to have at our disposal can you do
the same to solve for side a how long is
side a in meters and you can just enter
the number you don't have to type in the
M</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
