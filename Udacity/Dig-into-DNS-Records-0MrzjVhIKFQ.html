same kind of information as host does
but in a more technical and complete
form so the host tool shows more human
readable information spelled out in
English sentences like such and surname
is an alias for this other name or this
name has address 52:25 84.3
the dig tool shows the same information
more or less but in a form that's more
readable for scripts and is closer to
the way that it's stored in a DNS
servers configuration file let's take a
look so here I did dig wwe.com and here
we see a question section that says what
is the request that we sent to the DNS
system and an answer section that says
what we got back see here's the name
that host says was an alias and we can
see as we saw before alias was done with
cname and here's the name that host said
it was an alias - and likewise these
names have a records with the IP
addresses but dig also gives us other
information it tells us what server
answered our query it tells us some
metadata like when the query was
answered and it also includes some other
fields that say how the query worked we
won't go into those in this course but
it's worth noting that you can get a lot
of information out of DNS this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
