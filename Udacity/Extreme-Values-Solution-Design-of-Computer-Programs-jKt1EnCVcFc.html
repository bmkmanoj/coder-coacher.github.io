and I've chosen the straight flush I
could have chosen anything and I say
when a straight flush plays solitaire it
wins and here I've chosen a list with a
1 straight flush and 99 full houses and
I'd say when 99 full houses play a
straight flush the straight flush wins
you may not know this notation these
types of operators in Python we can take
a list and multiply it by a number and
that just says repeat that list that
many times so 99 times a one-element
list is a 99 element list all with the
same element and then we can add two
lists together and that just says
concatenate them so this one element
joins in with these 99 elements to make
a hundred element list so this is far
from a complete test suite we would
really want much more complete coverage
of tests poker we have nine different
rankings of the hands we would want to
have at least one for each of those so
there would have to be at least nine
tests and probably many more tests than
that before we had real confidence that
we got it right but at least we got a
start and we have some simple sanity
tests within our test suite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
