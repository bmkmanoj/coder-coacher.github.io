process of case based reasoning and we
have portrayed as if this process was
linear but of course the case based
reasoning process need not necessarily
be linear as an example if the
evaluation fails then we might want to
adopt that particular case in a
different way as an example of the
evaluation of the candidate solution
that adaptation had produced fails then
instead of abandoning that particular
case we might want to try to adapt it
again alternatively if we have tried to
adapt the same case several times but we
just cannot adapt it we might want to
abandon that case and try to find a
different case from the case memory
there is another possibility
suppose that we retrieve a case for a
memory and we try to adopt it but we are
unable to adapt it to mediate
requirements so the new problem in that
case we might want to abandon the case
and try to retrieve a new one it is yet
another possibility let us suppose that
we retrieve a case from memory and it
exactly matches the new problem in that
case no doubt patient needs to be done
and we can jump down here to evaluation
in fact this is what happened when we're
discussing the KNN method in this way we
can see that there are many ways in
which this process need not necessarily
be linear so shoke earlier you said that
if the evaluation shows that the new
solution is good then we should store it
if the evaluation shows that the new
solution is not good we should try
adapting again or we should try
retrieving again but what about
evaluation showing that the new solution
is not good should we ever store those
indeed sometimes storing failed cases is
also very useful failed cases can help
us anticipate problems so imagine that
you given a new problem and you retrieve
from your case memory a failed case
their failed case can be very useful
because it can help you anticipate the
kinds of problems that will occur in
solving the new problem so that reminds
we have another example from our file
input problem one thing I've encountered
a lot when I'm doing file input is that
if you read too far in the file and the
program will crash and will give you an
error it will always give you the same
error and it's a very common problem
because different languages do file
input slightly differently so in my mind
I must have cases
of the different ways that it's failed
in the past so I can anticipate those
and do it correctly in the future
failures are great opportunities for
learning
when failures occur we can try to repair
the failure by going back from the
evaluation step to the adaptation step
or we can try to recover from the
failure by going from the evaluation
step all the way to the retrieval step
in addition we can store these failures
in the case memory when we store them in
the case memory then these failures can
help us anticipate failures that might
occur with new problems there's a flip
side to this just like it is useful to
store failed cases that is not useful to
store every successful case if we store
every successful case then very soon the
case memory will become very very large
and the retrieval step will become less
efficient this is sometimes called the
utility problem we want to store only
those successful cases that in fact help
us cover a larger span of problems this
means that even when a case succeeds we
want to store it only if there is
something interesting or noteworthy
about their case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
