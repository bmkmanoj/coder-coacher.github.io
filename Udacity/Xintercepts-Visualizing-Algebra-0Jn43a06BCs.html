let's examine ellipses ellipses are very
much like circles there's just one
exception the distance we go in the
x-direction will be different from the
distance we go in the y-direction so
sometimes we might move further from the
center in the X direction then we would
vertically in the Y direction and other
times we might go further in the Y
direction from the center then we would
in the X direction from the center will
see a lot of similarities between
circles and ellipses so let's try
looking at a circle first there's this
amazing online graphing calculator
called desmos if you've never heard of
it I highly recommend that you check it
out it allows us to easily enter in
equations and we can instantly see what
the graph looks like for now we're going
to look at the equation of a circle but
if you ever want to play around with
this on your own go to ww scom you can
create your own account and then start
to draw and save your own graphs for
circles we know they have equal amounts
of x squared + y squared and if we take
the square root of this number will get
6 that's the radius of our circle the
distance to any point from the center to
another point on the circle but what if
we wanted to graph this equation notice
that we have different amounts of x
squared + y squared now now I'm going to
go ahead and let you know that this will
be the graph of an ellipse so let's see
how we can graph it ourselves first
we'll take the equation and we'll divide
through by the number 36 when we divide
each term by 36 we'll get 14 x squared
here one-ninth y squared here and one on
the other side of the equal sign so
we're going to ignore our first equation
of the circle for now we've taken this
equation and rearranged it into this now
can you tell me what are the two
x-intercepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
