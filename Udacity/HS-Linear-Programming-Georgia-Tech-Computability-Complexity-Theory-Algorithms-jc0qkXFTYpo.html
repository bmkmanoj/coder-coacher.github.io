programming with the kind of problem
that you likely first encountered in the
high school algebra class a graduate
student is trying to balance work and
relaxation he finds the eating sleeping
and commuting leave him with 14 hours
per day remaining after two hours of
work he finds that he needs to relax for
a half hour before he can work
effectively for another hour his advisor
and probably his mother to want them to
work as much as possible will let x1 be
the number of hours spent working on
research and let X to be the number of
hours spent relaxing then we can express
this graduate students time management
problem as the following optimization we
expressed the fact that he has only 14
hours for these activities by saying
that x1 plus x2 is at most 14 and we
expressed the fact that he feels a need
for half as much relaxation as work
after two hours with this constraint
here of course he can't spend negative
time on either of these activities so we
need to add that constraint as well the
overall goal is to maximize time work so
we make that our objective function and
we want to maximize that subject to
these constraints now in high school
your teacher probably asks you to begin
by graphing the inequalities when we do
this we see that the constraints
generate the following polytope perhaps
your high school teacher didn't use the
word polytope but that's what this
region here is each constraint restricts
the solution to half of the plane that's
called a half space and the polytope is
an intersection of half space after you
graph the region the solution can be
picked out as one of the vertices in
this case it's pretty easy to see that
it's this one right here which is the
intersection of these two constraints
maybe if the formula was a little more
complicated than you weren't sure you
could have tested each one of the
vertices and take the one with the
highest objective value why is the
optimal solution at one of the vertices
will remember that in this problem and
all similar ones from high school
the objective function that is the thing
we're optimizing is linear the only
thing that matters is how far we can
move in a certain direction in this case
the x1 direction but it could be any
direction in the plane if you like you
can think of there being a giant magnet
infinitely far away pulling our point X
in a certain direction and trying to get
it as close as possible to the magnet
this point must end up at one of the
vertices if some point is interior then
we can clearly improve by moving in this
direction if a point is on the edge then
we can improve by moving along the edge
the only time we couldn't improve in
this way would be if the edge were
perpendicular to the direction we wanted
to move in maybe the magnet is actually
up here and thus it would turn out that
this point here in the middle of the
edge is optimal but then actually both
vertices on either side of this edge or
optimal two so if we just want a optimal
solution it always suffices to just look
at the vertices thinking more abstractly
there isn't always an optimal solution
as there is in this particular case if I
eliminate this constraint here like so
our polytope is unbounded in the
gradient direction of our objective in
this case we can just keep moving our
point X further and further getting
greater and greater values for objective
function you give me an X I've got a
better one hence there's no optimal
solution on the other hand if I put back
that constraint and add another one we
might find that there are contradictory
there is no way to satisfy them all if
there are no solutions there can't be an
optimal one so those are the three
things that can happen the constraints
can create a bounded region and we find
an optimum inside of there the region
can be unbounded in which case it's
possible that there's no optimum
solution because for any solution
there's always a better way or the
region that satisfies all the
constraints can be empty in which case
there's no so
at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
