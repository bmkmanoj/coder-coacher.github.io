works I've defined a procedure spin loop
spin loop starts by initializing the
variable i-20 and then it goes through a
loop n times each time through loop it
just adds one to I so that'll run for
longer we can by picking the value of n
make it go through the loop any number
of times so let's try that so we'll try
running the loop a thousand times and
now we get no result and the time it
took is 0 point 0 0 0 1 seconds so about
a tenth of the millisecond let's try it
with a larger number of executions so
now I'm going to increase the number of
iterations by 10 so the value of ends x
10 and if we see that now the time is is
higher the time is increased to about
six-tenths of a millisecond and we can
keep increasing the time so let's try
looping a hundred thousand times and we
see the time increases and the time
increased by about a factor of 10
between looping 10,000 times and looping
a hundred thousand times and we'll try
one more time let's go for a million if
we go for a million times now we're up
to 0 point 0 5 so 5 hundredths of a
second or fifty five milliseconds to
loop a million times still pretty fast
right we're going through that loop a
million times it's still much less than
a second what's important is we can see
that well the time changes depending on
the input as we increase the input to
spin loop the time a creases accordingly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
