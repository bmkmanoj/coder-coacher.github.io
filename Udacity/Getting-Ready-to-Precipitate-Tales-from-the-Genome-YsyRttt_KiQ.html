and dish so now we've been through the
first two steps and we've got a nice
solution that's mixed up gnashed pretty
well digested protein we need to move to
our third step which is where we filter
out all the unwanted chunks of
strawberry that are left over and this
is one we're actually going to use our
coffee filters and second glass so what
you can see here it is i'm going to take
two coffee filters mainly because one
just isn't quite enough i'm going to
place it inside the cup here and then
I'm going to take my strawberry mixture
and I'm going to pour it right here in
the middle just like that now I'm going
to grab the coffee filters by both sides
and I'm just going to lift up and you'll
see that it's filtering through this is
liquid that contains the salty DNA
that's dissolved in it and all those big
strawberry chunks are left in the coffee
filter so I can squeeze the filter just
a little bit and get even more out okay
once you have enough of this peak salty
DNA strawberry liquid then you're ready
to go into the next and fourth step
where we precipitate the DNA with
alcohol so I'm going to go to the
freezer I'm going to get out our rubbing
up put in there so this
nice and cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
