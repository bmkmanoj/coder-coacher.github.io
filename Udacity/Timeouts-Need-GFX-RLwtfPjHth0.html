IP address and port and try to NC to it
well depending on the address you pick
you might get any of several different
results and see might exit immediately
or it might just sit there and do
nothing for a while and then eventually
exit with an error saying that it timed
out you might have sometimes seen
similar errors from a web browser
talking about a connection timeout TCP
has a number of built-in timers if it
takes too long to hear back from the
server we're trying to connect to TCP
will abandon the attempt to make a
connection and give an error to the
application there's another different
time out from when our end has sent some
data but the other end hasn't yet
responded so when you're building
applications up at the web level that's
something to keep in mind sometimes
you'll send a query to another endpoint
and you won't get anything back and
whether the default behavior is
reasonable depends on your application
that's why various libraries such as
pythons requests library have the
ability to set a time out on queries and
notice when that time out has elapsed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
