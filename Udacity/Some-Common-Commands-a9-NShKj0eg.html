work with file names for example LS
lists the names the files in the current
directory right now we have just one
file things dot zip let's go ahead and
unzip that so you have more files to
work with if you didn't download things
that zip earlier refer to the
instructors note below for instructions
the unzip command typically takes one
argument the file name of the file to
unzip as it works unzipped lists the
files and directories it's uncompressing
let's use LS to see all these new files
it looks like we have some text files
and some directories - another useful
command is cat give catalyst to file
names and it'll print out the contents
of the files for example we can read
bivalve text and gastropods text by
running this command cat is a funny name
for a command but it makes sense when
you realize it's an abbreviation for
concatenate cat concatenates files and
outputs the result you can also use cat
to read a single file just give it one
file name a lot of people use cat is our
go-to command for reading short files
later on in the course we'll learn other
ways of reading files that work well
with larger files if you are watching
closely you might have noticed that I
was able to type those commands with
superhuman speed I'm not actually a very
good typist though I was just using one
of the shells built-in time-saving
features tab completion if you press the
tab key while typing a word the shell
will try to autocomplete it for you for
example I can cat bivalves txt by
tapping cat VI and pressing tab since
bivalves txt is the only file that
starts with BI the shell can
autocomplete it for me but what happens
if you use tab completion when there's
more than one match let's try it - file
star with GA s gastropods txt and
gastropods draft dot txt when I hit the
tab key the shell Auto completes as far
as it can if I hit tab again the shell
will tell me all the files that match
since I want to read gastropods drafts
txt I can type an underscore and press
tab again to enter the complete file
name alright we've read files from the
command line
but we can do more than that there are
also commands to analyzing files WC is
the word count program it tells us how
many lines words and
i'ts are in the file since bivalves txd
has one species per line and two lines
of citations we know that the file
describes ten different critters another
command for analyzing files is diff diff
compares files and shows you how they
differ this can be useful if you have
multiple versions or additions of the
same file and you want to know what
changes have been made in this case it
looks like the left file gastropods a
txt has one line that the right file
gastropods Draft doesn't have this
little angle bracket points in the
direction of the file that includes the
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
