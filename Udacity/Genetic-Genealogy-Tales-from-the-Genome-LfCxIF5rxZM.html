in studies of human genetics and
genealogies and you're actually pretty
excited to start helping adopted
individuals find biological family
members an adopted individual contacts
you with results from their 23andme
report showing that they actually have
about twelve point five percent identity
by descent IBD with an unknown person
that means they're genetically related
to someone at about twelve point five
percent so they want to know what this
means and how best to proceed now the
adopted individual doesn't understand
this and they've come to you because
they want to know what this twelve point
five percent relatedness means and they
also want to know how best to proceed if
they want to reach out and contact this
person so I want you to tell me what's
the likely relationship that this
adopted individual might share with this
unknown person and what advice are you
going to give them to help them connect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
