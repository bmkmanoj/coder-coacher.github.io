let's revisit the problem that we had in
our last lesson once again this is the
map of a part of Long Island and the
problem is to go from Q to the end
location here so I'll call it Q problem
we have retrieved from memory the decays
which takes us from this initial
location to this goal location
clearly this dks is potentially useful
for addressing the Q problem but it is
not useful as is the initial location of
the D case is not the same as the
initial location of the Q problem and
the end location of the D case is not
the same as the end location of the Q
problem so we can start with this D case
what we need to adapt it so this leads
us to the overall process of case based
reasoning the basic process of case
based reasoning consists of four steps
the first step is retrieval and we
already consider this when we were
considering learning by recording cases
K nearest neighbor is one way of
retrieving cases from memory once we
have retrieved a case from memory that
is relevant to the current problem we
need to adapt it for example in the
previous problem we had the D case and
EQ problem and we needed to adapt the
decays into the Q problem there are many
similar examples all of us program and
all of us as computer programmers
sometimes use case based reasoning we
are given a new problem to address and
we often look at the design of a program
that we have come across earlier
so that's retrieving a case and they're
adapting that particular design of the
old program to solve the new problem
once we have adapted the case to meet
the requirements with a new problem we
have a candidate solution for the new
problem but that candidate solution is
to be evaluated for example in the
navigation problem when we have a
solution of the Q problem we can
evaluate it whether it will actually
take us to the end location we can do a
simulation we can walk through it as we
walk through it we will be able to
evaluate whether the solution actually
succeeds in meeting the requirements of
the problem for the programming problem
once we have a new program that we
obtain by adapting the old program we
can actually run the program to see
whether or not it will meet the
requirements of the new problem
let us suppose for a moment if we
evaluate the candidate solution and it
succeeds then we could encapsulate the
new problem and the new solution into a
case and store it back into the case
memory so that the case member is
constantly increasing
notice that this case based reasoning
process unifies memory reasoning and
learning there is a case memory that
contains a large number of cases and
that's how we retrieve cases that are
relevant to the current problem we
reason when we adopt an evaluator and we
learn when we store the new case back
into the case memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
