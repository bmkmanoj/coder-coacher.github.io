question of data transport ability this
is sometimes called serialization in
Java or marshalling or even pickling
some of the differences that might
arrive have to do with bit order yes
some some machines order the bits from
high order to low order in different
orders wide orders within a word
different character sets that are used
alignment that is whether particular
pieces of data are aligned on word
boundaries or bike batteries okay and
then the whole question of word length
now we have of course 64-bit words but
other machines are only 32 bits and of
course there are uses of data storage in
which we wish to use less than a full
word even after these differences are
resolved there's still the question of
how the various pieces of some complex
data are are organized okay once they be
kept in a certain order can they be can
they be shuffled around in order to
compact them these days many approaches
to data representation includes
self-definition that is not only are you
communicating the data but you're
communicating a description of the data
that can then be decoded at the other
end fortunately various standards have
arisen to address these kinds of
questions internet standard x 680 is one
and then on the commercial side google
has developed the idea of protocol
buffers which are descriptions of data
which then can be incorporated into your
applications for communication among the
pieces and interpretation at either end
by an API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
