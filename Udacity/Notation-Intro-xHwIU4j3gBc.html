efficiency when you look at two pieces
of code you can maybe tell which one is
going to be faster and which one is
going to be slower but how do we say
definitively which one is faster and
which one is slower and how do we
communicate that with our co-workers and
the people around us we can describe
efficiency of code with something called
Big O notation the name is odd if you're
hearing it for the first time but it
turns out to be a very straightforward
name every time you use this notation
you literally write a capital letter O
parenthesis and some algebraic
expression inside the parenthesis the
algebraic expression is always going to
be a mathematical function of the
variable n such as some of these
examples as you can see these all
contain algebraic expressions with the
letter n the only exception is this guy
right here yes the number one still
counts it's just another way to write
zero n plus one so this is a value we
can still use so what does the algebraic
expression mean in this case well n
represents the length of an input to
your function let's say you received a
secret coded message from one of your
friends and a cipher that tells you
which letter maps to what you want to
automatically decode the coded messages
with the cipher your friend gave you so
you write some pseudocode to figure out
how you can do that you take a string
input you iterate through it and change
each letter based on the cipher and then
you output a new message this pseudocode
shows you what it might actually look
like ok so to get a sense of the time
efficiency we're just going to count up
the number of lines creating an output
string and returning an output string
each only need to happen once every time
the function is run to represent that we
can go ahead and add a two to our
efficiency
now both lines inside the for loop have
to get run for every letter in the input
for those we can add a to n since 2 is
the number of letters in our input
string and we have 2 lines that need to
get run for
one hopefully the way we count up lines
and turn it into something in Big O
notation is starting to make sense to
you let's take a look at some examples
if our input string had ten letters the
calculation would look something like
this
and we would end up with the value 22 to
get the actual efficiency you can
multiply 22 times the amount of time it
takes for your computer to run one line
of code if the input string was 1
million you would have to multiply two
million times the amount of time it
takes for your computer to do a
computation there you go looks like
you've got the basics down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
