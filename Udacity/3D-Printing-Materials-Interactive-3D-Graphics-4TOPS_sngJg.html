material you have sort of a as this guy
who's kind of rubbery or so what kind of
materials are the right so there's lots
of different kinds of 3d printing but
right now you can almost 3d print and
any material that you can think of I've
seen things out of bronze we've done
things out of different types of metals
all sorts of plastics this one has a
rubberized fading into a plastic texture
which is kind of crazy so this is all
one print also and it has the rubber
going right into the hard a clear
plastic which is pretty crazy and this
was also designed in a super easy
program called 1 2 3d design that I mean
children could do it I mean all the
parts are in their native and you just
stick them together and this is what you
get out at the end you know no other
time in history it could you ever put
something together this quickly of this
caliber</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
