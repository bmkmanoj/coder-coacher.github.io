their input from data files only which
made reproduction and easy task modern
programs use complex user interfaces and
these make it hard to observe and to
control the users input the standard
approach to reproduce user interaction
is to use a capture replay tool a
capture replay two acts like a layer
that interposes itself between the input
as provided by the user and the actual
program these tools can operate in two
modes during recording mode all input
coming from the user is passed down
directly to the program as is all output
from the program so the user just
interact normally with the program as
always but during the capture all input
from the user that is mouse clicks
keystrokes and similar events are
recorded in a log file during replay the
program executes under control of the
CAPTCHA replay to getting its inputs
from the previously recorded events and
thereby ignoring regular user input that
is all the events which were previously
recorded and now passed on to the
program just as if they were input by
the user and the program produces its
normal output technically spoken such
tools realize capture replay by
intercepting calls to library or system
functions which would normally provide
user input let's do this on an example
where the program which takes commands
from a command line and processes them
here's the function input command which
is opposed to accept a command and
process is a function which then
processes the command as entered this is
how such an input command function would
be implemented in Python the function
raw input outputs the prompt on the
console and accepts a line that will
then be returned by the function raw
input and therefore input command the
IDE we're having in here however does
not support interaction with programs so
we simulate the whole thing by reading
commands from an array instead here we
have a list of commands with every
invocation of input command the next
command is returned from the array and
we do so by increasing the index command
index by one every time input command is
called the first time it returns open
second time nitrogen save third time
returns quit here's the function that
actually handles the command all it does
at this point
is to print out the command and if the
command starts with Q such as the quit
command then the global resume variable
is set to false meaning that our while
loop over here simply exits now we have
to move the main function at the end
such that it gets executed after all the
functions defined let's see whether this
works properly it does you may have
simply the three commands printed out
and with a quit command the loop simply
exits here's how capture replay tool
works it replaces the original input
command function by a new function which
wraps around the original input command
function calls it also returns its
original value but on top of that it
also saves the command in a log now
example here we're simply going to use
this list here where every new command
is to be a pendant this isn't simple
programming exercise and I leave it over
to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
