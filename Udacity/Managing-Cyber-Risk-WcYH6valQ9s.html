we don't understand all the threats we
don't know what our vulnerabilities are
of course those two play into likelihood
of a successful attack of course is
going to depend on what sort of
vulnerabilities you might have and who's
trying to target you but we said well if
you can come up with a probability and
what happens is the result of an attack
then you can compute the risk that's how
you quantify or assess the risk and you
can try to reduce it but that's really
the question of managing that risk how
do we manage what options do we have for
managing the risk that our business is
exposed to on the cyber front so we
talked about assessing it but if it's
too high then of course we like to
reduce it so how do you reduce cyber
risk as we said before we get into
reduction assessing required the
likelihood as well as the impact so how
do you assess the impact it's the
expected loss we are talking about so
it's expected losses really lost
multiply the probability so we do have
to get to the loss and when you talk
about loss it could be reputation loss
target of course suffered including
decrease in in cells it's the cost of
calling somebody n so for example if
your Sony and you call fire IRA mandiant
to come and figure out what happen I'm
sure the paid for that mandiant or fire
I got compensate really well your
response there may be legal costs you
may have to buy identity theft
protection for your customers and things
like that it's real dollars reputational
what you do in the aftermath all that
has to add up to sort of the cost or the
loss that you would attribute to a
certain attack and expected I said was
that value multiplied by the probability
so that's really risk risk was probably
he ties impact so maybe we impact is
lost so let's just talk about last year
so this one would still be talking about
you're assessing risk now let's talk
about how do we manage risk so the only
three things you can do once you come up
with some sort of a risk estimate you
can say well I can live with it in that
case you are accepting the risk you may
want to transfer it so the risk is
transferred to another
already so if something bad happens to
you the consequences are the cost is
going to be borne by somebody else
that's somebody else is going to do it
only if they are paid to be in that
business and that business is the
insurance business so you can buy
insurance and by buying insurance you're
transferring it to whoever ensures you
the other option is you can reduce it
how do you reduce it well you're going
to reduce it by deploying new technology
solutions maybe a more expensive more
effective firewall you can reduce it by
educating your people or having a you
know training and things like that more
security awareness of course is going to
ensure that it's less likely that they
make a mistake so that's going to reduce
the likelihood of the probability which
of some adverse event which we know as a
fact and the way we computed risks so
managing once you have an estimate of
the risk the couple of options on how
you can deal with that risk as we said
it's transfer thing happens in lot of
other domains you buy insurance for your
car free health and things like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
