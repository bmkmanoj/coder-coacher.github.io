in this overview of software
architecture is evaluation
it doesn't do you that much good to
develop this fancy architecture if you
is not the right one okay so we need
some process by which we can judge the
correctness completeness consistency and
other quality aspects of the
architecture we've produced because of
its the importance of software
architecture on the ultimate product
being developed it's key to get it right
because if we make a mistake is very
costly to make a change so some
approaches have been developed for
dealing with architectural evaluation
one of those is architectural review
boards that is for large systems which
are developed by multiple teams or maybe
systems of systems making a change can
have impacts on various unexpected
places in the ultimate system and so
it's good to have the stakeholders
particularly development stakeholders
sit down and evaluate the impact of
those changes some organizations have
formalized this into periodic meetings
that review suggested for architecture
suggestions for architectural changes
also some some evaluation techniques
have been developed software
architectural assessment method or Sam
I'm going to show you a slide on this is
a relatively informal one more formal
one developed at the software
engineering Institute is the
architectural trade-off analysis method
