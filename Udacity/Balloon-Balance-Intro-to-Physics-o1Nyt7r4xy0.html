electric fields can build up between the
ground and the earth let's say that in
one particular lightning storm you have
an electric view of 10,000 Newton's per
Coulomb pointing downwards and let's say
you want to take advantage of this
electric field by taking an air filled
balloon that you've recently inflated
that's a balloon by the way and rubbing
it on your head because actually rubbing
a balloon on your head actually causes
the rubber of the balloon to strip
electrons away from your hair and give
the balloon a negative charge by doing
this you're hoping that you can take
your balloon and have it suspend itself
inside this region of electric field in
such a way that the weight of the
balloon downwards is exactly balanced by
an electric force upwards if we know
that the weight of the balloon or i
should say the mass of the balloon is 30
grams how much charge must you put on
the balloon to have a balanced perfectly
in this electric field enter your answer
here in coulombs and I've set this up a
scientific notation so you can enter
your exponent here and the base part of
your number here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
