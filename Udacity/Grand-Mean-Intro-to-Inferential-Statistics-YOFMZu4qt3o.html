sizes are equal in other words there
could be five values in each sample or n
values in each sample the grand mean is
the same as the mean of sample means
since there's an equal weight to each
sample in calculating the grand mean
however when sample sizes are unequal we
have to find the grand mean by adding
all the values from each sample and
dividing by the total number of values
the sum of the sample sizes when sample
sizes are equal the grand mean is the
same as the mean of sample means since
there's an equal weight to each sample
and this is the same as the mean of all
values where capital n is the total
number of values in all the samples but
when the sample sizes are unequal we
can't use the mean of sample means we
have to add all the values in all the
samples and divide by the total number
the sum of the sample sizes but in this
lesson we'll only work with samples of
the same size so it's fine to use the
mean of means here's a quick explanation
in symbols if you're interested let's
say we have three samples x y and z the
mean of x is x bar the sum of each value
divided by the number in that sample the
mean of y is the sum of all the values
in Y divided by the number in Y and
likewise for sample Z we want to know if
the mean of means equals the total mean
the sum of all the values in x y and z
divided by the total number in each
sample well we know that because the
mean of X is the sum of the X values
divided by the total number that the sum
of X is just X bar times the number so
we can replace that in each of these the
sum of the x i's equals the average
times the number in X the sum of the Y
values is the average of Y times the
number etc well these are not the same
if the number in each sample is
different but if there's the same number
in each sample let's just call it n then
we can rewrite this as n times the sum
of the sample means divided by 3n the
ends cancel out and then you get the
same thing so that's why if the sample
sizes are the same which they will be
throughout this lesson we can just use
the mean of means but just remember for
later in Lesson 13 we'll work with
different sample sizes so to calculate
our grand mean we'll have to add all the
values and then divide by the total
number of values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
