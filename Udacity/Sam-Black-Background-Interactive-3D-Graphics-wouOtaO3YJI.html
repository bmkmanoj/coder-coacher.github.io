in San Francisco with Sam black so Sam
well first of all tell us about your
background I have bachelor's degrees in
electrical engineering and computer
engineering from University of Michigan
and master's in computer science from
University of North Carolina I've worked
in various parts of the graphics
industry I started out in workstation
graphics working on one the first
commercially available x server then I
went to working the games industry if a
little while came out to California work
for Pixar for eight years and then came
to Autodesk so you've really gone
through what i consider sort of three
pillars of the the graphics industry
which is a film games and computer-aided
design tell me a little bit about like
well you know what are the pluses and
minuses of each well they're all hello
they have a lot of similarities amongst
them and so it's really just sort of the
end product that you're looking at this
different and everyone thinks the games
are so much fun to work on but in a way
they're almost the hardest because they
tend to have the most compressed
schedules although the film industry has
tight schedules but the projects that i
was working on intended to be a little
more open and i was working on the
render man product and some advanced
rendering techniques so i wasn't tied
directly to a film to a release so i
didn't feel all the pressure that yeah
you'd normally feeling those things and
then coming here to autodesk working on
autocad again very similar i'm working
in the graphics field and it's just a
lot of getting the the right visuals out
there with the right performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
