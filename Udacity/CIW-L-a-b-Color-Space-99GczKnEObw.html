bSpace sometimes called lab space but la
be actually where L is luminance and
then as you change the a and the B you
end up with different colors I'm gonna
use the word color now instead of the
more technical words later which we'll
use so here you have a luminance of 25%
so it's kind of darker and you see the
greenish reddish and bluish things as
you move around and in the middle is
kind of gray right and as as luminance
gets brighter the middle gets brighter
and you get these lighter variations in
color and so that's called the la be
color space and the idea is that you've
got luminance and you've got sort of how
saturated the color is and actually what
the what we call the color but what it's
typically referred to as the hue and
that's sometimes defined you can think
of the color as a three-dimensional
volume of one sort or another and you'll
see there's a whole bunch of ways of
representing it but the idea is that one
way of thinking about is that down here
is dark up at the top is brighter and as
you move around the circle so it goes
through zero 360 run again is what's
referred to as the hue okay and as you
move outside things become pure in color
alright
so two systems that people use a lot to
talk about these things are called
sometimes hue saturation and lightness
or sometimes hue saturation and value
there are all different kinds of color
spaces these two can be drawn as sort of
these thick cylinders so down here again
at the bottom things are dark up at the
top things are light in hue saturation
and lightness the whole top is white
which I think by the way is an awful
representation I'll tell you why in a
second down the whole thing is in the
bottom is all black and as you go around
you get different colors that's what you
can see around here different use and as
you go from the middle to the edge you
get more and more saturated so in the
middle everything is gray it goes from
black to white
through gray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
