algorithm works and what the structures
are and so on let's go through a long
example that kind of helps you do things
on exams when we ask you kind of do
Thomas who was algorithm for a few
cycles let's see how to do that I
conveniently came up with tables like
this so that I don't have to draw
everything by hand here we have the
characteristics of our processor
basically this is that the load unit
takes two cycles to execute the load ad
takes two cycles to execute adds and
subtracts multiplication will take ten
cycles and divide will take forty cycles
and they're done in the multiplication
unit and the initial content of r2 r3
and r4 are like this this is the table
that gives us our instructions in order
like this so this is the very first
instruction here we will note in which
cycle which instruction issues begin
execution and writes the result this is
basically our rat this is where we will
say what cycle we are currently in and
this is our reservation stations these
are the two load reservation stations
these are the three reservation stations
for the others and this is the
multiplication units reservation
stations the load reservation stations
are all really going to be our load Q so
they're going to be slightly different
from the others here we will just check
when the instruction is in a reservation
station this is going to be what the
operation is this is where we will store
the value that we have for this operand
this is the value for the second operand
this is what we are waiting for in the
first operand this is what we are
waiting for for the second operand and
this is whether the instruction has been
dispatched so that we can keep track of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
