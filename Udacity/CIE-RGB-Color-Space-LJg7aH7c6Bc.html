experiments we're done by these folks
right and guild in 20s although the
experiments people know about are a
little bit later in the 30s they were
trying to map this notion of wavelength
to perceived color right so this is what
I was telling you about before where as
I change the wavelength how do much do
you have to change the RGB in order for
you to say that they match and they were
allowed you to be able to say that two
colors are more similar to each other
through this process and they define
what was called the CIE color space CIE
actually stands for Commission on
illumination or something in French and
that's why it's CIE so the diagram they
came up with here this is called their
XY chromaticity diagram a couple things
to notice and we'll talk about what x
and y are in a minute these are the
colors as the wavelengths go around
right so you're getting longer and
longer wavelengths all right and get
back to here so the numbers around these
blue numbers around the border those are
the wavelengths and the middle is what
you get by blending different colors now
what do we mean by blending well what
they figured out when they were looking
at people computed playing with these
RGB lights and other things well as they
came up with a new color space that
wasn't just RGB but that it was going to
be a linear transform of RGB but that
the prominent value was gonna be called
Y what is y stand for it stands for
luminance don't ask me why it is because
it's actually from the XYZ space and the
idea is that Y is the luminance and so
the necks and Z were two other
quantities with which you put between X
Z and Y you could figure out the color
and you can represent a wide range of
colors and in fact in this diagram that
I was showing you before you'll notice
down here it says x and y well it was
just this X normalized by the sum and Y
normalized by the sum and so in some
sense it's for sort of a fixed luminance
taking the lumens out of it and you can
see as you move into the middle you
can't see that at all because it's red
drawing on red as you come to the middle
you're blending all these and that's
gonna be white and we'll talk or gray
depending upon the luminance and we'll
talk about that in the minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
