but I'm not quite as confident on this
one as I was on the previous two so two
things are going on here first in the
past we've always seen that bricks are
on top here we're seeing a wedge on top
for the first time but what we have seen
in the past is that different shapes of
blocks can play the same role so we saw
cylinders bricks and arches all playing
the role of these vertical bars so what
I'm going to say is that we can have any
kind of block on top as well and
therefore because the wedge is a kind of
block I say that this still is a foo but
I could be wrong so the give this answer
David again use his background knowledge
someone else in the class might say that
well he does not think that this
particular wedge here is the same kind
of block as the brick and therefore this
is not an example of fool so I want to
draw a number of lessons from this
particular exercise first learning is
often incremental we learn from one
example at a time cognitive agents human
beings intelligent agents in general are
not always given hundreds or thousands
of millions of examples right from the
beginning we get one example at the time
second often the examples that we get
are labeled there is a teacher which
tells us this is a positive example this
is a negative example this is called
supervised learning in machine learning
literature because here there is a
teacher which has labeled all the
examples for you third the examples can
come in a particular order there are
always some positive examples or with
some negative examples the first example
typically is a positive example fourth
this is quite different from case based
reasoning in case based reasoning which
we had discussed last time we had order
these examples which we stored in their
raw form in memory we reuse them in this
particular case however we're
abstracting concepts from their fifth
the number of examples from which we are
extracting concept is very small we are
not talking here about millions of
examples from between the abstraction
sixth when we are trying to abstract
answer from examples then what exactly
to abstract what exactly to learn what
exactly to generalize becomes a very
hard problem there is a tendency to
often over generalize or often to over
specialized how does the intelligent
agent find out exactly what is the right
level of generalization these are hard
questions and we look at some of these
questions in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
