bipolar disorder in an Amish family now
at first glitch you may think that this
looks pretty familiar and may make you
feel right at home but like many complex
traits this pedigree looks different
than it would first single gene disorder
for example if I told you to look at
this pedigree and tell me if you thought
the inheritance pattern was dominant or
recessive you might be inclined to say
dominant if you look at the fact that
the trait doesn't skip generations and
affected parents do give rise to
affected children but you might also
think that it's recessive for example
over here the trait skip generations and
it did over here as well and we have
unaffected parents with affected
children that's typical of a recessive
trait we're actually somewhere in
between this is complex out of need this
pedigree indicates a more dominant
inheritance pattern now if we assume the
trade to be dominant like we learned
about in lesson five and completely
penetrant right that's the only kind
we've talked about up to this point then
we would expect affected children to
have at least one affected parent but
that's not what we saw what we see are
unaffected parents if you thought the
trait looks more recessive we wouldn't
expect it to show up in every generation
like it did here these little deviations
from our normal inheritance patterns are
a key indicator that there are likely
multiple genetic factors as well as
environmental factors controlling the
phenotype whenever we find incompletely
penetrant traits or alleles this is
likely what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
