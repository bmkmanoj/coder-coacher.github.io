to do digital signatures so we think of
physical signatures as authenticating
documents when something is signed that
means that the signer is responsible for
the message in the document physical
signatures don't actually work very well
for this purpose
someone can cut and paste a physical
signature or maybe they can modify the
document after it's signed and there's
nothing that really guarantees that the
signature and the document are matched
what we want with digital signatures is
something much stronger than that we
want something that shows that the
person who signed it agreed to the
message and the message can't be changed
without also breaking the signature so
how can we do that with asymmetric
cryptography so here's our goal we want
Alice to be able to sign a message
transmit that message to Bob Bob should
be able to read the message and know
that it could only have come from Alice
so the question is what should we use
for their respective keys k1 and k2 in
order to provide that digital signature
where the message that Bob receives
proves that it was signed by Alice so
here's the choices we've used for k1
Alice's public key and k2 Alice's
private key for the second choice will
use Bob's public key for k1 and Bob's
private key for k2 for the third choice
we'll use Alice's private key for k1 and
Alice's public key for key too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
