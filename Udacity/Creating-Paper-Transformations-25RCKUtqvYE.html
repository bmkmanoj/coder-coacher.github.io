circular reveal will cover other
elements of meaningful motion in more
detail later in the course so let's
consider this a preview in this app
clicking one of the recyclerview items
will kick off our circular reveal
transition to new item text the circular
reveal effect is used a lot in material
design and ties in nicely with ripples
so let's talk a little bit about how
we're gonna make this circular reveal
this is the signature of the create
circular reveal function the view we're
going to operate on a sinner X&amp;amp;Y to
start via transition a start radius and
an ending radius so let's say this is
the view group holding the text we want
to change first we need to find the
center point of our reveal we can do
that by taking the items width and
height and dividing in half the reveal
should start from nothing so our
starting radius is 0 you might remember
from geometry class that the diameter is
a line segment that passes through the
center and whose end points lie on the
circle the radius is half of the
diameter so if we fit our item to a
circle and situate the center points
here to line up our ending radius would
be about from here to here or a little
bit more than half the width of the item
one reason why it would be a little bit
more is just because if it's a square
item it's not going to perfectly align
with a circle so you would need to
adjust that so now we have all the
pieces that we need to create a circular
reveal as I mentioned before you
couldn't just use half of the width of
the item you actually need to use the
hypotenuse of half the width and half
the height and here are all the
components of the create circular reveal
function that create our animator after
that set we changed the text and the
title along with the background color
lastly we start the animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
