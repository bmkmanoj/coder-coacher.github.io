collect from the application domain we
need to distinguish between two main
types and you probably heard about these
ones functional requirements and non
functional requirements functional
requirements have to do with the
functionality of the system with what
the system does with the computation for
example the elevator shall take people
to the floor they select that's the
functional requirement that has to do
with the functionality of the system or
for a very simple one the system has to
output the square root of the number
passed as an input so these kind of
requirements have in general
well-defined satisfaction criteria so
for example if for the latter one that
we mentioned it is pretty clear how to
check whether the output is actually the
square root of the number passed as an
input non-functional requirements
conversely refer to a systems
non-functional properties systems
qualities such as security accuracy
performance cost or you know usability
adaptability interoperability
reusability and so on so all these
qualities that don't necessarily have to
do with the functionality and unlike
functional requirements non-functional
requirements do not always have clear
satisfaction criteria for example if we
say that the elevator must be fast
that's a non-functional requirement
right has to do with the speed of the
elevator which is a quality of the
elevator but it is not clear how such a
requirement could be satisfied how can
we tell whether the elevator is fast or
not so what we need to do in these cases
is that we need to refine these
requirements so that they become
verifiable for the example that I just
mentioned for instance we might say that
the elevator must reach the requested
floor in less than 30 seconds from the
moment when the floor button is pushed
this is still a non-functional
requirement but is a verifiable one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
