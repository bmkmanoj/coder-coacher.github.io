much more succinct actually lots of
different ways of writing something this
simple and some of them are very very
succinct so here's a more succinct way
of writing the same thing what we can do
is in one command sum up all the
elements and divide by the length and
we've now computed the same thing twice
now what do you suppose the running time
is of this second statement here it's
just one little arithmetic statement it
seems like it should be big theta of 1
but it's not you have to keep in mind
that this sum command here is actually
just shorthand for a loop like this so
it really is running over all the
elements of the list internally so even
though it looks like it's big theta of 1
this still is big data of the length of
this list or big theta of n so this is
one of the things that is different
between a language like Python and say a
language like C so C basically doesn't
allow you to hide running time in the
individual statements all the C
statements run pretty much constant time
whereas in Python so that you can write
more complicated programs in a nice
succinct way they do give you these
shortcuts but you have to be really
careful that you know what the running
time is of all the little primitive
functions before you try to actually
measure the performance and predict how
fast your algorithm is going to run this
can really bite you so you have to be
careful the extremals of the list are
the extreme values that max and the min
it's just a kind of a cooler way to say
it the extremals the x-games
but it's actually an awful lot like min
so what I'd like you to do is actually
modify the mean algorithm that we had to
actually compute the max of a list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
