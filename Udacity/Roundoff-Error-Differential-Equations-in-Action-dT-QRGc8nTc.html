effect of a finite time step but
actually also the representation of the
values on the x-axis is coarse grained
now we have a look at what this leads to
and for simplicity it's again the
forward Euler method as a test case
we're using that satellite that's almost
you stationery from unit to it takes
precisely 24 hours to complete one orbit
around the earth what's critical about
the forward Euler method in terms of
round off error is this edition and this
one x of t is a number of reasonable
size in this case quite an amount of
meters I'm just drawing some ghost
figures here to give an impression but
the step size times the velocity is
pretty small in comparison because we're
multiplying by that small step size if
the velocity is of reasonable size and
we multiply by that small step size you
get a number that's rather small in
comparison to X and then we form the sum
of these two numbers and get something
that looks like this but actually this
number again is computed and is being
stored at the procession of X we lose
precision in that process actually you
see the value of x didn't have enough
position to start with the smaller we
choose the step size the smaller this
number becomes the more grave the effect
of round off error will be the effect of
the roundoff error is that we actually
are losing the details of velocity and
forest we could have gotten away with
not computing these digits anyway to see
a noticeable effect of round off errors
in a manageable time I'm cheating a
little here i'm using standard oil arm
but then i'm multiplying by a number of
1 plus tiny random number this epsilon
is defined to be 2 times 10 to the minus
sixth power in advance so this looks as
though i have a pretty huge round off
error everytime so this is the result
that we get first i have to explain why
we see several points for each step size
this is because we're dealing with
random numbers and because I let the
computer try out every step size 10
times the overall behavior is what we
know with the father
Euler method the arrow depends linearly
on the step size at least four step
sizes that are small enough but for very
small step sizes you see 00 the arrow
explodes when we have many small steps
roundoff error accumulates and destroys
our result what you should be learning
from this is reducing the step size only
takes you so far there is a threshold
after which the arrow goes up again and
may become severe let's look at the same
data from a different viewpoint let's
not plot how the arrow depends on the
step size but let's plot how the arrow
depends on the number of steps and this
is what we get for a small number of
steps the step size is large and the
forward Euler method introduces a huge
error which then decreases in a linear
fashion but as the number of steps grows
we get more and more aurora tool to
round off and a simple model for this
behavior would be to say that the error
introduced by rounding is proportional
to the number of steps and hence
inversely proportional to the step size
