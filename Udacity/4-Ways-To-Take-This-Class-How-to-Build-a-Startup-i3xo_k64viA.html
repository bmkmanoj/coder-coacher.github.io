if you're interested on the logistics on
how to take this class this lecture 0
will describe it but if you want to just
get started click on lecture 1 so the
good news is there's actually four ways
to watch these lectures so a good way is
to kind of watch them and use the
Udacity discussion forums to interact
with other people watching these
lectures something that's better is
these lectures are free and they don't
really require any books or text but
there are books or text and I would feel
a little guilty not telling you that
Alexander Osterwalder business model
generation book is kind of the standard
for understanding the business model
canvas and the startup owners manual
written by yours truly and my co-author
Bob Dorf is kind of the standard for
customer development but let me
emphasize again these are not required
and you can understand the lectures just
fine without them but they certainly
help explain a lot of the detail in the
617 pages because it's almost an
encyclopedia for startups enough of the
ad that's the last time I'll mention
buying the Dexter books almost best is
to actually watch these lectures but
this time form a startup team and
actually think about instead of just
sitting in your office or on your
computer actually be watching these as
you start your company now the best way
to actually watch these lectures with
facilitators and coaches and mentors and
the way you can do that is by physically
taking the class with Startup Weekend
next if you go the website SW next org
you could find out how to sign up in
your city and town and participate as a
team with groups of other teams
physically week to week and one of the
reasons we kind of suggest that you
instead of just watching the lectures
actually get out of the building and do
it either by yourself or with your team
or with Startup Weekend is startups are
not about lectures an entrepreneurship
is not about your grades and this class
is about the work you do outside the
building after you watch the lectures
not how much the lectures you watch
entrepreneurship is experiential it's
hands-on and it's immediate and intense
