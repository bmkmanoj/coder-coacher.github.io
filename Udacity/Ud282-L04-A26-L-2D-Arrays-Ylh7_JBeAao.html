average of an array of doubles to get
the average temperature for example now
say we want to write some Java code that
would perform basic grade analysis for a
great table like this we're given the
grades for four different subjects for
five different students which ended up
with the table that's four by five items
in it and that's equal to 20 in grades
so we might think okay we can store all
of those in an array of integers that's
20 integers long but this won't help
with a lot of the analysis that we want
to do like if we wanted to get the
average grade for each student
we'd have to perform this average
calculation per student individually but
if all of these integers were stored in
this one array it becomes really tricky
to match every number in the array to a
specific student in a specific subject
so one solution is to store the grades
in multiple arrays we could have an
array for every student storing the
grades for all the four subjects and
then we could use loops for example to
calculate the average per student but
say we wanted to calculate the average
per subject to see how students are
performing in biology for example we
need to access one individual item in
all of these arrays and loops won't be
able to help us for that so instead we
could possibly create an array for every
subject rather than every student and
that way we could easily calculate the
average for every subject individually
but we can't loop over the grades for
every student anymore that's why when
you're trying to deal with data that
looks something like a table or a grid
Java offers something called a
two-dimensional array you can think of a
two-dimensional array as an array of
arrays like imagine every single row in
this table is an array of integers by
itself we can actually bundle all those
together into an array of all these
arrays so that each individual array is
indexed from 0 to 3 and then each item
inside these arrays are also indexed to
declare a two-dimensional array you type
in the type of the data that's stored
inside followed by two sets of square
brackets and then the array name
this is because we're actually creating
an array of array of integers called
grades the beauty of 2d arrays is that
you can access any item in this table
given the two indices like if we wanted
to know Tim's grade in biology for
example we can type in grades of 2 and 1
this 2 here is referring to the index of
the array that we're interested in which
is biology in this case and the one here
and the second square brackets is
referring to the index of the item
inside that array so grades of 2 and 1
would have 75 stored in it say for
example we wanted to know Sam's grade in
English that would be stored in grades
of 1 and 3 because English has an index
of 1 and Sam has an index of 3 so we
always start with the index of the array
itself
and then the second set of square
brackets has the index of the item
inside that array what should we use to
find out what Sandra's grade was in Arts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
