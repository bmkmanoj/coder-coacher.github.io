want to drop out of a class for which
you're registered there are two times
that you can do this one is during
registration either in phase one or
phase two during this time you can add
and drop classes whenever you want from
the home screen click add or drop
classes to get back to your schedule
then under the action column click the
menu for the class you want to drop then
click delete then click Submit changes
when the screen refreshes I'll see that
I'm no longer registered for that class
after registration ends you can still
drop a class until the withdrawal
deadline however if you're withdrawing
after registration closes you'll receive
a W on your transcript for that class to
withdraw from a class go to the same add
or drop classes link that we clicked
earlier after registration closes you'll
no longer see this delete option instead
you'll see a withdrawal option click
that and then click Submit changes to
withdraw from the class as long as you
drop before the registration deadline is
over the drop will not be noted on your
transcript that means that until the end
of the first week of class you can join
and leave whatever class you want after
the end of the first week of class
withdrawing from a class will get you a
W on your transcript to check the
withdrawal deadlines visit the
registrar's website the withdrawal
deadline is typically a little over
halfway through the semester</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
