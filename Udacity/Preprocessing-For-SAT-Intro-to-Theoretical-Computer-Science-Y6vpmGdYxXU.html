here we have x1 not x1 not x1 and x1 I
have no idea what to do with that so
it's probably not easy what about x2 so
here we have x2 x2 not x2 still kind of
difficult to see if we should set it to
false making this clause here satisfied
or if we should set it to true
satisfying those two clauses up here
it's not easy or at least it's not
doable without playing around with other
true or false assignment what about x3
same case so here we have x3 not x3 x3
again x3 not x3 no idea what to do with
that so all that remains is X for now
where does x4 appear x4 appears here and
x4 appears here and what you'll notice
is that both time we have not x4 so x4
could appear in two forms right so x4
could appear as x4 or as not x4 but we
have just this one form appearing and
this goes back to the answer of the
previous quiz where I gave you an
intuition for what makes SAT hard what
makes SAT hard is that if you choose a
truth assignment of true or false then
some clauses obviously become satisfied
but in other clauses you get less
variables to satisfy that clause however
if you have a variable that just appears
in one form then you don't have that
dilemma it's always clear that we should
set X for which is the correct answer
here to false because then we satisfy
this clause here we satisfy this clause
here but there are no secondary effects
again so all of the other clauses are
unaffected by how we set X 4 so we just
choose it to our advantage and of course
also this is something that is easy to
do algorithmically so for each of the
variables that appear in a boolean
formula an algorithm could just go
through and see if that variable appears
in both forms so as the variable itself
and in the not form and if it appears
just in one form then we already know
how to set it so we have now found a
third pre-processing rule for set now
let's step back a little bit and look at
the general requirements of
pre-processing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
