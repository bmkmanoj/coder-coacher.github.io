unfamiliar platform for others you might
know it and love it our goal is to make
you know and appreciate the power of
LinkedIn when I moved to the u.s. from
Germany I did not know what to put in my
English linkedin version as Germans are
generally more private I saw filling up
my LinkedIn as a horrible pointless
hurdle that really stretched my limits
however after doing some research and
getting more familiar with the
customization options of LinkedIn I
started to realize that linked and held
a lot of potential if you skillfully it
could give me a lot of agency in
creating my personal brand and ideal
professional identity a linkedin profile
contains multiple customizable sections
you can change the order of those
sections depending on your background
and better convey your goals to
recruiters for example if you're
switching careers completely you can
make your project section proceed your
work experience you can also create your
own professional headline this means you
can define what you are not your current
job title you can select a professional
image of yourself allowing you to make a
great professional first impression
before the interview you can also
present a compelling summary statement
that frames your story this is extremely
helpful if you're changing careers are
new to the field or simply have an
eclectic background like me linkedin
invites you to present a comprehensive
list of your professional experience
with detailed bullets about what you did
at each place finally with LinkedIn you
can present information about your
passions hobbies causes and interests
that may not fit on your resume if you
have a LinkedIn profile what parts do
you have currently feel free to respond
