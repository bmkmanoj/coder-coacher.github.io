jitter to reduce over plotting but it
turns out that there's more that we can
do let's hear from more about how she
used her domain knowledge and a
transformation to make an adjustment to
her scatter plot the next thing that I
did was to take again their perceived
audience size and their actual audience
size but this time I transformed the
axes so this time it's as a percentage
of their friend count some people in the
study had 50 friends some had a hundred
some had 2000 and so it actually makes
more sense to think about your audience
size as a percentage of the possible
audience all of the people in this study
had shared their post with friends only
privacy so you'd expect that it would be
bounded by their friend count so what we
found when we plotted it this way was
that all of the points are below this
line of perfect accuracy this diagonal
line really well below and one other
thing I should note about this plot we
actually ran two different surveys we
ran one survey where we asked people in
a single post how many people do you
think saw saw your post but we also
asked a different set of people in
general how many people do you think see
the content that you share on Facebook
and so that's what this plot is showing
this is the in general question and
their guesses are a little bit higher
but still people typically think that
maybe 10% of their friends see their
content when in reality it's more like
40 or 50% even 60% of their friends will
see their content in a given month so
that's what this plot is showing is the
percentage of friends who actually saw
their content in the last month again
they're under estimating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
