server is through HTTP requests when you
type Udacity com into your browser bar
and hit enter your computer sends a new
HTTP request to Udacity servers that
request contains specific information
about the page that you want inside of
it you'd ask these servers then receive
that request and decide what content to
respond with based on the information
that is contained inside of the initial
request are you looking for the homepage
the registration page the cancellation
page well once the server has found the
appropriate information it sends it back
to you or to your computer typically as
an HTML response that your browser can
then display to you alright it's time
for a helpful analogy this is Julia she
represents our client in this analogy
suppose julia is really hungry she goes
to her favorite restaurant and finds her
usual table a waiter comes he takes her
order I miss hello what can I get you
today so I was thinking about the
oysters and tapioca but I think I would
really like to strawberry jell-o's
please all right to Strawberry jell-o's
coming right up thank you and the
request has been made hey chef mm-hmm
the waiter which is actually just me
dressed as a waiter then takes the
information about her order and sends it
over to the kitchen to be prepared so we
got a new order here table 3 wants two
servings of strawberry jello chef Diego
then takes that information and prepares
the appropriate meal so chef when you're
gonna show me how to cook
okay Thank You chef when the meal is
finally ready the waiter brings it back
to Julia who's been waiting patiently
for the meal she requested and the cycle
is complete Julia asked for some food
and she got that food all right so
that's the end of this analogy
thankfully time to go back to reality in
internet land rather than requesting a
meal users typically request web pages
which are then constructed on a server
and sent back to the user to be
displayed by the browser it's sort of
like this here's Julia again but this
time she's requesting a particular URL
evening miss have you decided yes so I
was thinking about the oysters and
tapioca but I think I'm actually gonna
go with HTTPS colon slash slash wwwdcom
/ nanodegree ok so that was HTTPS colon
slash slash wwwdcom / nanodegree yes
excellent choice okay let me get this
out of your way and I'll be right back
thank you the request is made and it's
off to a server which will hopefully
respond to some content hey chef so we
got a new order table 3 wants one order
of HTTPS colon slash slash wwwdcom / 90
degree got it so chef I was wondering
this is it it's fresh oh okay Thank You
chef the webpage is prepared and sent
back to the client as part of an HTTP
response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
