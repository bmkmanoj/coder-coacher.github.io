into a special class of problems called
np-hard np-hard problems don't have a
known algorithm that can solve them in
polynomial time as I mentioned during
the discussion of the knapsack problem
polynomial time algorithms have a
runtime where n has a constant exponent
like N squared and we want algorithms
that can solve problems in polynomial
time or they're often too slow to be
useful the knapsack problem is actually
also an np-hard problem the solution we
looked at was in pseudo polynomial time
and no true polynomial time solution is
known since the problem is so difficult
there are two classes of algorithms
considered solutions the first star
exact algorithms which don't happen in
polynomial time but will get us the
correct answer the second our
approximation algorithms which don't
always find the exact optimal solution
but generally find a near optimal
solution they tend to run in a more
reasonable amount of time and several or
even polynomial time the brute force
solution 2 TSP has the same philosophy
as the one for knapsack find every
possible combination and pick the best
one but it takes significantly longer
it's in factorial time so n multiplied
by every integer between it and one
there are also dynamic programming
solutions for TSP the most famous one is
the held carp algorithm however even the
dynamic programming solutions are slow
the runtime for this particular solution
is in exponential time even though the
approximation algorithms don't find the
exact optimal path there is a lot of
active research into them for TSP one of
the most famous called Christopher DS
algorithm works by turning a graph into
a tree where the starting node is the
root creating and traversing through it
in a particularly intelligent way the
algorithm guarantees that the path it
produces will be at most
d % longer than the shortest route there
have been some slight improvements on
this for specific cases of TSP but
generally it's considered to be the best
there is TSP is an interesting case
study for this type of difficult problem
particularly since it has so many
applications and is so widely studied
while you likely won't get asked about
it directly in an interview it's good to
know that problems like this exist and
that it is possible to get an interview
problem with no efficient solution you
don't need to worry too much about the
exact meaning of np-hard or similar
classes but it's good to remember that
even the brightest minds can't solve
every problem efficiently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
