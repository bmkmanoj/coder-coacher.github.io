and we're going to interview paul roth
idea from Brazil paolo could you please
introduce yourself through our students
and my name is Paulo I'm from Brazil i'm
the founder of Zeebo so an open-source
organization and we're doing server-side
Swift which is awesome and that's
probably it okay and how do you get
started as an iOS or Swift developer I
think it was yeah it was 2014 that Apple
announced Swift and then I started
working with Swift it was amazing gotta
get very excited about it what what you
think is most most exciting about Swift
what is what would you really like about
language the language is very expressive
like you only have to write which you
have to write you don't have to write
stuff because of the language like the
language is not verbose or anything so
you can focus on your business logic you
know and get the language the language
out of the way just focus on you have
one on what you have to focus on as a
first language do you think it makes
sense to use a swift if you're just
learning to program I think it's a good
first language definitely I think that
was sawed off from the start because
it's a language that's not very
different from any other language it has
some similarities with C which is a very
popular language it's the base for most
languages and they're focusing focusing
a lot of stuff for beginners like
playgrounds and now we have Swift
playgrounds on the iPad and I think
they're they really want even kids to
start programming with Swift so yeah I
think one of the best languages for that
right now and talking about Zeebo can
you explain a little bit more what it is
I understand it's a set of frameworks
for doing
server development or back-end
development in in Swift is that correct
yes and why do you think that Swift is a
good option for this this a specific
task there are other languages that are
used for thee for this sort of task and
most of them are dynamic or interpreted
languages what do you think that Swift
brings to this well first of all the the
expressiveness of the language that
makes the language in general a good
language language but also Swift is very
fast it was made by chris lattner the
guy that created llvm and the guy knows
about performance in those kinds of
things so it's a very good fast language
and also it's a safe language the the
problem is not a problem the difference
between a dynamic language most of the
dynamic dynamic languages that are today
like Ruby and JavaScript they're not
type safe so Swift is and that's a huge
win because you were you can be more
certain that your software will work and
of course you need unit tests as well to
test the logic itself but having a
type-safe language gives you a lot more
power in that sense so I understand that
the the peel of something like zero for
an iOS developer if I want if I need a
back end for my appt usually have to
write it in another language now I could
use exactly the same language is it
ready for production if I wanted to
start right now can I start creating
back ends with a zero yeah you can do
have a lot of look like a lot of stuff
more than 80 modules I think we have
pretty much what you need to do basic
stuff and some advanced than stuff but
the problem right now is not the amount
of things that we have it's already but
the problem is that Swift 3 is not ready
yet so the language is still in flux so
it changes quite a bit from every
snapshot that we got from the Apple team
and I think it's only going to be ready
when Swift through is released and this
fall maybe september-october we don't
know yet so there are many languages and
frameworks for making a backends for for
apps and I understand the appeal of zero
in the sense that you don't need to
learn a new language but what else the
Swift bring to this kind of application
first I mentioned the expressiveness of
the off Swift and that's a very good
thing on its own but when you compare it
with other dynamic languages most of
them are not typesafe and Swift is
awesome in that sense because you can
have code that you know if something is
going to work or not on compile time so
that saves you a lot of trouble and
makes your code more safe so you can
focus on your business logic and not
having to write in a unit test to check
for something that the compiler can do
you know also it's very fast it was made
by chris lattner the guy that created a
lot of yam so the guy knows about
optimization those kinds of things the
language can even be faster than see
sometimes which is amazing and when you
get all those things together the safety
this expressiveness and the speed you
get like a beautiful language that works
anywhere actually not only on the back
end that's what makes Swift beautiful in
my opinion if you are a beginner iOS
developer you're just starting to learn
Swift G
it would make sense to learn also how to
write back ends in Swift was evil for
example that a skill that you think will
be marketable yeah if you're a beginner
probably bad best you focus on your
knees cute that you want to build but if
you have more skill than then just iOS
the market is going to look at you know
because they're looking for people that
knows to do more than just one stuff so
i think that's that's a pretty good
thing to learn anything for yourself if
you're not work trying to get a job or
anything you want to start a start up
start up for example you probably have
to do any everything so you can go
you're going to have to learn that
anyway so i think yeah so it's good to
learn back end with as well ok and
you have the same language from the
client all the way down to the back of
that yes you have less context switches
so you don't have to think a lot now I
have to think Ruby now I have to think
JavaScript you just get one language
that suits pretty much everything and
how hard you consider it is moving from
iOS 20 reason how's the learning curve
yeah there are a lot of differences
because iOS is mostly based on objective
c stuff that came with foundation so
people are very used to sub classing and
delegate you could have those things
with in the back end as well but those
are things that came with Objective C
baggage and we try to make zero
specifically be very 50 so we use a
different concepts there they're not
that different they're just with maybe
different names we instead of
inheritance we use composition
some stuff like that but the basics are
the same everywhere so it's not going to
be that hard to switch okay and Apple is
also changing foundation to make it more
swifty so exactly in the end it's a
natural movement yeah okay okay and
there are also other frameworks out
there competing for the same market yeah
Holly what does e will have a special
woods yeah the strongest point i think
the strongest point will be our
concurrency mark actually 0 is
encouraging concurrency motto eggnogs
agnostic so it's a hard what to speak
but yeah we do have different models one
of them is a grand central dispatch that
everyone knows from iOS and mac OS x
that now became a class but we have a
different model that's based on ghost
concurrency model that's awesome because
one of the main problems about
specifically no j as for example is the
callback hell we have that with GCD also
yeah exactly so if you're on iowa's yeah
you have to to use probably our RX swift
or something like that to handle the the
callback problem and JavaScript you have
promises and future and those kinds of
things but with ghost concurrency model
you don't have any do you don't have to
carry about callbacks or anything you
just use your code in a synchronous way
we like we're a cosmid to reason about
so the code is much cleaner it's easier
to reason about it's easier to handle
our errors so that concurrency model is
a very very strong feature we have in
its faster than the knees in threads
because there's no system calls involved
so it's it's pretty much everything you
need for server-side development paulo
let's move into a little bit of gossip
ever
that you had an interview with chris
lattner the creator of Swift yesterday
could you please tell us something about
that yeah it was an amazing experience
actually it wasn't an interview it was
get together hosted it at WWDC suit get
together there was like four corners
well we could talk about different
subjects and my corner was was open
source Swift and chris lattner was with
me in Ted crema knock from apple we were
representing open source and it was an
amazing experience to be able to talk to
Apple engineers and there were people
from from IBM as well but the amazing
thing was to have a chance to talk to
the public though there was a
fourteen-year-old attendee that was
awesome he was very interested in Swift
and said how cool what can I do with it
how could I start it was very very
exciting to be there so do you think
that Apple is behind the open source
projects that are starting to be
starting around oh yeah and Swift in the
back end yeah definitely like this
chance was amazing right I don't know if
they ever did that before if they
brought people from outside Apple to
WWDC event and there's also going to be
a session friday about specifically
about server-side development with Swift
yeah and it on the description it says
that they will show some examples of the
community and that's also something that
I've never heard about and I'm very
curious about what they're going to show
their do you think 0 will be featured
are you going to be there yeah I don't
know about that that's bad I'm finite
yeah I asked keturah guys from IBM if
they knew 7 and they don't so I thought
if not 0 if na ktora what would it we
will be talking about keturah since
there are several different options that
could become a little bit confusing but
I've heard that you guys are creating
kind of a common standard exactly
they're called
open opens with something Swift could
you please tell us more about it yeah
open Swift is an organization we're
trying to create standards for servers
the server side specifically the best
thing best thing about it you could use
like you have your application built
with keturah for example and then you
can use as your server or any other
organization that wants to be a server
but the best thing I think is going to
be the mirror where you can write them
an open swift compliant mirror and you
can use it in any framework so people
won't have to to recreate cold or stuff
like that and now right now we have zero
that's compliant vapor it's also
compliant and we have slimane which is a
Japanese framework and we also it was
funny because every day we find that we
find a new framework yesterday I was
talking with the IBM guys there show me
some stuff about their package manager
not no sorry not package manager package
package catalog when you can see all the
packages the all Swift package manager
packages that are available on github
and then you can see the dependencies
and we were looking at the zero module
in that there and there was flamingo
they're listed it as a dependent
dependent on the depends on zero package
and then what's this flamingo thing and
we went there it's another new web
framework there we never heard about so
if I understand correctly it's certain
objects that are common to any
server-side applications such a request
response those are common to all exactly
okay so that makes a lot of sense yeah
that's the thing we have a lot of common
code that can be shared with everybody
we also had a swift open-source get
together on tuesday with IBM folks at
bluemix garage
they hosted it and the most part of the
conversations were about finding this
common ground so we can just move on in
Butte higher level stuff and that's what
we've been doing with zero and open
swift and now we want to get together
with everyone perfect is also at the
open swift initiative they are doing a
bit of refactor but they plan to to to
adopt open Swift as well if not open
Swift whatever comes with we need the
standard right so open surface
initiative but maybe can change to
something else maybe you could become a
core library from Apple that was talked
about yeah yesterday as well so perfect
so if i want to start right now with
zero where should i go on github yeah we
have a web page with some documentation
it's zero dot IO and the slack slack see
what I oh and the github is get up / 0
and you have a main repo that's github /
0 / 0 so if you go in any of those
places you you'll be able to start Paulo
we have many students all over the world
and currently in Brazil our student
basis growing enormous there anything
special you would like to tell her
Brazilian students yeah peace all
whooping starsia a moon to ligando fish
en cuando se comme SI trabaja con ESO no
es aqui amici inspira mesmo in tosa
stare interesting komasa trabalha an
open source and you have commented
demise mi vida multi-tier a change so
I'm all I'm very excited about Zeebo and
I feel that you're even more excited
about it what have you done recently
yeah I did this crazy thing every time I
talked I say that people get for what
did he do that so I quit my job to work
full time with 0 and
people might think well that's crazy but
actually I believe a lot and what's
happening we see you and everything and
also the worst case scenario is i get a
job somewhere else and so there's
nothing but nothing nothing to fear
about that you know and also open source
is getting more and more important so i
think people should be very encouraged
in working on open source it i think
it's a great thing actually i hope then
our students do check out yeah they will
I'm also very excited about it and I
think you did the right thing yes she
believed in something you should
definitely go for it yeah definitely and
YZ whoo what's the names what does it
stand for zero it I was trying to find a
short word for the github repo like four
letters and then I try to find small
words on google translate like 0 / for
example and then 0 came up and then was
available and 0 is 0 and hidden creole
which is a form of french so they
correct pronoun pronunciation
pronunciation would be something like
the walk 0 yeah because in fridge is 0
hope and the curio creole version will
be 0 something like that I don't know
that's definitely very interesting thank
you very much and at least I hope our
students are interested I'm definitely
very interested in the wall I hope to
get started as soon as possible yeah you
should thank you very much for having us
and enjoy the rest of the confidence
