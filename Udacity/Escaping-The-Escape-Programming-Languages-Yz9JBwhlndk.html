these new regular expressions like any
character accept new line or
set complement of what we've been
talking about to the test
I'd like you to submit via the
interpreter assigned to the variable reg
ex but python regular expression that
matches double quoted string literals
and this is the sticker allows for
escaped double quotes let me just jump
over to the interpreter briefly to show
you what I'm talking about and then
we'll come back here it turns out that
there's one of those gritty details in
this problem that makes life fun but
also complicated the first time the
sorts of strings that I want you to
accept I like this one down here double
quote you say and then there's a escaped
quote yes escaped quote I say no we've
got escaped quote no escaped quote and
then it ends this is a well-formed
well-balanced string literal with double
quotes and some escaped double quotes
however to get it to Python remember
that Python is going to treat the escape
sequences meaning no literally the next
thing but what if you want to literally
have a backslash then you need to escape
the escape sequence it is Turtles all
the way down my friends so if you want
to do some testing on your procedure
here this string one this is what you'd
have to enter into Python in order to
get it to be the sort of string that
we're looking for here I started with
single quotes and then I've double
escaped this backslash then the double
quotes double escape again here I've
added two more just to make this extra
clear and all three of these are
positive examples whoops I'm so wrong I
have forgotten the closing double quote
at the end of I say hello this is a
negative example whoo let's go fix it
here we go add in another quote now all
three of these are positive examples of
the sorts of strings you'd want to match
you say yes I say no and I do realize
that there should be a quote here but
I've intentionally left out the
apostrophe and don't so as not to
confuse the issue since we're already
talking about quoted strings so here
just to remind you I've written out a
positive example in a negative example
on the left is what you'd have to say to
Python
and on the right is what it means and
the big hints are that you'll probably
want to escape the double quotes in the
backslash just like we did here and you
may want to consider having parentheses
nested inside other parentheses this
one's tricky good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
