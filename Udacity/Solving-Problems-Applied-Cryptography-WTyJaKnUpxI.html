we're going to look at ways to use
cryptography to solve a wide range of
problems in unit 5 we focused all on
using cryptography to solve the
traditional problem of authentication
and then communication with secrecy and
integrity what we're going to look at in
unit 6 is different kinds of problems we
can solve using cryptography the first
thing we'll look at is anonymous
communication and we'll learn about how
to use a chain of asymmetric encryption
to enable two parties to communicate
over a network without anyone knowing
that they're even talking with each
other then we'll look at how to do
voting and there are lots of issues with
voting we won't get into all of them but
look we'll look at the issue of can you
provide an accurate tally know that each
vote is counted without revealing who
voted for whom this will also be done
using a chain of asymmetric encryption
but with some added features to ensure
that the vote tally is correct then
we'll look at ways to provide digital
cache a way to represent and transfer
value similar to paper cash that can be
done all with cryptography this will
involve introducing some new techniques
we'll look at a centralized way of doing
that which can be done using a new
technique called blind signatures and
we'll also look at a decentralized way
of doing that that doesn't require any
trusted authority but uses proofs of
work to create value and this is what
the Bitcoin network does this is just a
small sampling of the kinds of things
that you can do using cryptography all
of these can be used just using the
tools we've seen in this class and we'll
see ways to use asymmetric cryptography
in many different ways in these examples
will also see ways to use symmetric
cryptography including hash functions as
well as one-time pads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
