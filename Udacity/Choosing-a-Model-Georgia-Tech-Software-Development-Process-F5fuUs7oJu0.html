models and there are many many more and
because these process models define the
masterplan for our project the specific
process model that we choose has as much
influence over approaches success as any
other major planning decision that we
make therefore it is very important that
we pick the appropriate model for our
development process picking an
appropriate model can ensure the success
of a project on the contrary if we
choose the wrong model there can be a
constant source of problems and
ultimately it can make the project fail
so how can we choose the right model for
a project to be able to do so we have to
take into consideration many factors in
particular we need to be aware of what
level of understanding we have of the
requirements do we understand all the
requirements are we going to be able to
collect all the requirements in advance
or collecting requirements is going to
be hard and therefore we might want to
follow a process that is more flexible
with that respect another important
point is the expected lifetime of the
project is this a quick project we're
putting together for a specific purpose
or something is going to last for a
number of years and then we're going to
maintain over all those years that's
going to make a difference in the way we
decide to develop that project also what
is the level of risk involved do we know
the domain very well do we know exactly
the technologies involved well is so we
might go with a more traditional process
otherwise we might want to be more agile
more flexible it is also very important
to know the schedule constraints how
much time how many resources do we have
for this project what is the expected
interaction with the management and the
customer in particular for this ladder
there are many processes that rely on
the fact that there can be a continuous
interaction with the customer if that
interaction is not there there's no way
we are going to be able to use these
processes conversely there are processes
that don't require the presence of the
customer at all except for the initial
phase and maybe some checking points and
so if the customer is very inaccessible
we might want to follow one of those
processes instead of one of the more
demanding ones in terms of customers
time finally it is important to take
into account the level of expertise of
the people involved do we have people
that know the technology that we are
using do we know people that know a
specific kind of process some processes
require some specific expertise and
we're not going to be able to follow
that process if we don't have the right
expertise so we need to take into
account all of these aspects in some
more in order to be able to make the
right decision and pick the right
software process model for our project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
