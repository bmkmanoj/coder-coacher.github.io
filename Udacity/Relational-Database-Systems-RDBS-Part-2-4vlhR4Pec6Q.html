a relation or a table that we just
talked about this example that we have
here is the name of this relation or
table is employee because it stores
information about employees that we have
maybe in a certain company so the the
columns or the attributes schema that
we're talking about is defined as
follows going to have an employee named
going to have an identifier for the
department in which they work that's d
id the salary we don't have the value
but we have a code for the salary we
have the employees ID and then we have
their phone the information about a
given employee consists of their name
the department the salary hold their ID
and their phone number so you can reach
them now in this particular organization
we have a bunch of employees Robin Neal
Jasmine Cody Holly and so on so for each
of them we're going to have at Apple so
if you look at sort of a given row in
this table here that is what we are
calling it topple and we uniquely
identify those by the employee ID so in
case of Robin for example 2 3 4 5 is the
primary key value for employee Robin so
we're going to seek primary keys are how
we actually say what set of employees we
may want to get information about and
things like that so this is the key and
these are the key values that we have
here so as you can see for each employee
that information makes up a couple in
the table the collection of those is
structured organized this way that's
what makes a table the various
attributes that we have which define
what's stored in this table is based on
this schema that we have here I have
something else here which said foreign
key and the reason I included that here
is because sometimes you may want to do
operations across different tables so
foreign key basically is going to be key
in some other table and we can do what
is called joins for example you want to
put data together from multiple tables
well you can say this is the foreign key
that should match a primary key in
another table and then I want to pull
information about Robins department
salary code
boy ID from here and our social security
address other things from a different
table and things like that so there may
be the department ID is the key for
example and won't be unique and if
you're trying to pull Social Security
numbers and things like that the foreign
key is essentially a primary key
somewhere else and somehow sometimes you
may have to sort of combine information
from multiple tables and we use these
keys for doing that and and so some of
the fields maybe the attribute values
that we have here you're not going to
use them as a key for accessing tuples
from here but when you refer to another
revelation and operation across multiple
tables that's where they get used again
if you've done your database course you
probably have learnt a lot more about it
then what we need here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
