I'd like to match it to some model or
some previously observed depth scene how
might I do that well what I need to do
is I need to find some patches some
locations on my object and match them to
some locations on my object and you know
it should be somewhat invariant to how I
look at it right so I'm looking over
here looking over there I want to find
the same thing the object might be
rotated things might we've seen this
movie before remember we were matching
pictures we as we had two pictures that
were rotated translated scaled and we
wanted to align them do you remember
sift sift was a way of saying in Harris
points remember they were Harris Stevens
points and nobody ever remembered
Stevens we had ways of finding points
and then generating a descriptor and
that the script er had to be sort of
discriminative and yet robust that is we
wanted them to be relatively unique but
robust so when we found a description
here and we matched it with the
description there it would most likely
be the right one
and then we improve that we used ransack
in order to find the right sets of
matches well we can do exactly the same
thing with depth you know its drawn here
is that I've got this interest point and
I've got this sort of neighborhood of
these five points around it or I might
look at a at a volume of these and what
I'm gonna do is I might find the
relationship between these points and
say the little local normals associated
with the point or something to do about
the geometry the idea is whatever it is
that I'm measuring is not a function of
how I looked at the points so in fact
the way we often do these is we
typically will build a we'll take these
points and we'll build a description and
we'll put them into a histogram okay so
maybe we just quantize these different
orientations into you know five
different levels so we have you know
five level thing and then we might have
distances so in fact one example they
used a five by five by five histogram
that gave you a hundred and twenty five
different values okay I remember in sift
I think we had 128 different values so
here we have a hundred and twenty-five
different values and then for every
patch we compute these and we can
compare them against the patches in our
model find the putative match
and then do something like ransack to to
do the matching there's a version called
the fast point feature histogram which
is a way of doing this in 3d and again I
think is probably implemented directly
in the point cloud library so there are
a couple places where the point cloud
library I already pointed you at point
clouds org for many of you in the
robotics universe there's something
called Ross the robot operating system
originally out of Willow Garage and then
it's its robotic software open found 8
it's got all those letters in it it's an
open-source ongoing development system
for doing robotics and the point cloud
library and by the way OpenCV computer
vision library are all part of that
universe and that's really helped make
it easy for people to do that
development and there are drivers by the
way in that for using the Kinect or
primeSense
sensors as well so you can go get your
point clouds that way so here's a
picture that I showed you before from
point clouds org and in fact here it
says ransack cylinder segmentations so
basically they ransacked to find the
different planes and to also find these
different cylinders you know how to do
that already so you could do this and it
basically gives you a direct
interpretation of the geometry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
