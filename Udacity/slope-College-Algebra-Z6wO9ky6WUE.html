brand 184 brand 2 and 10 again for brand
3 this is really interesting for both
brand one and brand 3 when we move over
10 in the X direction we have to move up
100 in the Y direction and of course 100
/ 10 is just 10 I drew this right
triangle on the gray line which
corresponds to brand one but the same
exact triangle can be drawn for the line
for brand three this has exactly the
same proportions it doesn't however work
for brand too what's even more
interesting however is how this ties in
with our equations we said before that
brand one and brand three seemed the
most similar because they both had
coefficients of 10 in there x terms 10
is what we found for the slope of each
of them as well so seems like this
number the coefficient of the x term in
our equation corresponds to the slope of
the line this is also true for brand
number two we see a coefficient of eight
in the term 8x and a slope of eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
