I think so the first thing I noticed is
that if I put equal weights on all four
examples like I decided to instead of
solving this problem by thinking I would
just try a couple examples and see if I
found things in both boxes so if I put
equal weight on X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 then
hypothesis is one h1 gets three out of
four correct that's three quarters
that's better than 1/2 so then I fill
that in in the good boxes quarters all
the way down that's a turtle because
it's Turtles all the way down no no it's
not no it should be quarters all the way
down I thought you'd maybe draw quarter
I can't draw a quarter also can't draw a
turtle obviously but still agreed all
right anything any what do you think
anyone listening to this is old enough
to get Turtles all the way down yeah
that's a great joke everybody knows that
Chuck and if people don't know the joke
then you should pause this thing right
now and you should go look up Turtles
all the way down and then come back it's
a really great joke if you're computer
scientist yes and if you don't think
it's a good joke then you should
probably be in a different field okay
what about the evil distribution so then
I started to generate okay well what if
the issue here is that because we spread
all the the probability out and the
first hypothesis is really good so I
said okay well let me put all the weight
on the first example the x1 and now h1
does really badly gets it's a hundred
percent error and h2 is 100 percent
error but h3 is zero percent error so
putting all the weight on x1 is no good
and if you look x2 x3 x4 they all have
the property that there's always a
hypothesis that gets them right so I
started to think well maybe there isn't
an evil distribution and then I kind of
lucked into putting a half on both the
first and the second one because I
figured that that ought to work but then
I realized oh wait a second that's an
evil distribution because if you choose
h1 h2 or h3 they all have exactly 50%
error on the half a half distribution
very good so one-half one-half zero zero
is a correct answer now I don't know if
there's others you know certainly X
putting all the weight on x2 and x3 is
no good because h2 and h1 both get those
putting all the weight on x3 and x4 are
no good because h1 gets all
those correct in fact we have to have
some weight on x1 right otherwise h1 is
the way to go
right so ya know it's it's interesting
so what does that mean in this case what
do you mean what does that mean so what
does this tell us about what how do we
build a weak learner for this example so
what it tells us is since there is a
distribution for which none of these
hypotheses will do better than chance
there is no weak learner for this
hypothesis space on this instance a
interesting now is there a way that we
can like ok so that so this example has
no weak learner is there a way to change
this example so it would have a weak
learner um I'm sure there is like if we
change that x2 x3 if that was a check
instead of an X 1 X 2 h3 so if we made
that a green one yeah I'll make it a
green one by using the power of
computers
whoa special effects yes so now there's
no way to put weight on any two things
and have it fail I don't know my
intuition now is that this this should
have a weak learner ok well how would we
prove that I don't know but maybe we
should end this quiz yeah I think we
should in this quiz and leave it as an
exercise to the listener I'm pretty sure
I could figure this out by the way we
should point out a couple of things here
though Michael that one is that the if
it weren't the case if we had more
hypotheses and more examples perhaps an
odd number of them and we have the X's
and the Y's in the right places then
there be lots of ways to get weak
learners for all the distributions just
because you'd have more choices to
choose from what made this one
particularly hard is that you only had
three hypotheses and none of them was
not all of them were particularly good
sure yeah I mean if you have a but you
can have many many hypotheses and
they're all pretty bad then you're not
gonna do very well well it would depend
upon if they're bad on very different
things but you're right if you have a
whole lot of hypotheses that are bad at
everything you're gonna have a very hard
time with a weak learner and if you have
a whole bunch of hypotheses that are
good at almost everything then it's
pretty easy to have a weak learner
interesting okay this is more subtle
than I thought so that's that's it's
interesting right so with the lesson you
should take away from this is if you
were just to think about it for two
seconds you might think ok weak learner
that seems easy and often it is but if
you think about it for four seconds
that's actually a pretty strong
condition you're gonna have to have a
lot of hypotheses that are many of which
are going to have to do good on lots of
different examples or otherwise you're
not always going to be able to find one
that does well no matter what the
distribution is so it's actually a
fairly strong and important condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
