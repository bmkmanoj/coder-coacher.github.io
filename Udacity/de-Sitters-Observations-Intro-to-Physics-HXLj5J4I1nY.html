known as a binary star system now a
binary star system has as you might
guess two stars and these two stars
orbit around each other more precisely
they orbit around their center of mass
these orbits often are very small very
small radius and also very fast and so
what de sitter did was look at the light
emitted from these stars at different
points in their orbit so for now let's
just pay attention to star one and just
ignore start two so we know that if it's
going around this way well at this
instant in its trajectory its velocity
would be pointing in that direction
eventually the star is gonna make it all
the way around here and its velocity
will be pointing in exactly the opposite
direction now if the speed of light were
not constant in all reference frames if
you really could throw a light forward
like a baseball then when we looked at
this light on earth we might expect to
see some strange effects I'm actually
going to let an animation speak for me
on this one so here we have our one star
of our binary system and it's making a
circular orbit now at this upper point
in the orbit we can see it's moving away
from this detector over here at the
lower point in its orbit down here it's
moving towards the detector giving more
additional velocity to the light and if
you look over here you can see that that
light which was emitted at the lower
portion actually overtakes the other
light that was emitted earlier this
would lead to some really strange
observations so for example at some
point when this and this light arrived
at the exact same time light from the
bottom and top well that means we'd be
seeing the same star in two places and
it turns out the sitter found that that
doesn't happen this was a very clever
experiment to confirm experimentally the
second postulate of special relativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
