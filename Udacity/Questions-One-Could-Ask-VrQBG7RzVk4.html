audio spectrum and at the top up here
that's a waveform that's the actual
signal coming in its voltage as a
function of time going into a speaker
and what this is is this is what's
referred to as a audio spectrum short
term Fourier decomposition basically
you've got low frequency stuff down here
high frequency stuff down here with time
going that way and the question is
that's a sound what sound is that
obviously it's the song spectrum is the
spectrum of the prof onotori wobbler or
warp Warbler obviously I'm not a bird
person okay there's a picture of one but
the idea is if you listen to this bird
chirp and then you process it over time
or you listen to a chirp over time and
you process it you would see this audio
spectrum and the spectra of different
birds of course are different here's two
different birds the prophet or a Warbler
and the chestnut sided Warbler but what
you can see is that the spectra are
really quite different right and the
goal is to think about these things as
what's referred to as time series and
how would you distinguish between them
so for a given time series their
questions you can ask like which bird is
this okay so you've got you've got an
audio signal which bird is it how long
is this thing going to keep going is
this bird sick right that is you know
somehow not normal and are there
different sort of elements or different
phases that the book the bird has and
when you think of these in a time series
context which bird it is that's a
classification problem time series
classification how long will continue
might have something to do with
prediction is this bird sick would be an
outlier detection and finally you get a
notion of segmentation so that would be
for like bird data well how about other
time series data here's some so you know
here's stock data of different types of
indices over different amounts of time
and you might have questions that you
would ask like will this stock go up or
down something we all want to know what
type of stock is this right if you had a
set of categories
worries of stocks and is this stock
behaving the way it normally does and
that becomes just like we saw before
prediction classification or outlier
detection here's another example suppose
you were listening to the audio of this
music right so not looking at the
imagery of the score of the music itself
as shown here but actually listen to
somebody playing it you might ask things
like you know is this Bach or Beethoven
which would be classification can we
make more of that that's now a
generative model kind of question
computer music people are always
interested in listening to some music
could I have a machine produce more
music of that sort of type and can we
sort of divide this up into segments so
this is what's referred to as time
series segmentation by the way this
bottom one is segmentations received a
lot of attention lately something called
conditional random fields being applied
to we're not going to talk about that
we're going to talk about Markov models
but I just wanted to point out that you
might not use what we're going to learn
today's so much for segmentation as much
as you would for some of the
classification things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
