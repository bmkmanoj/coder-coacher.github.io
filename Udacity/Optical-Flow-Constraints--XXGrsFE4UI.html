little more carefully so the brightness
constancy equation what we're going to
do is assume we know that some pixel is
moving an amount UV u is the amount in X
V is the amount of Y when we get to T
plus 1 okay
the brightness constant constraint
equation can be written like this I of X
Y T that is the image at time T at
location X Y brightness if it's
grayscale color if it's color is going
to be the same at t plus 1 at location x
plus u y plus V where u and V or the
amount the point has moved in the X
direction in the Y direction
respectively so that's called the
brightness constancy constraint and in
fact I can rewrite it like this zero is
equal to the X plus uy plus VT plus one
image - the original I of X Y T all
right that's the brightness constancy
constraint the second assumption was
that we get a very small amount of
motion okay so that basically U and V
let's assume they're like one pixel or
part of a pixel or just things are
changing smoothly yes you know what's
coming what that means is I can estimate
using the Taylor expansion here that the
value of an image displaced from X by U
and displaced from from Y by V is
approximately well it's exactly here if
I order terms it's the original value
plus the gradient ex times Delta X plus
the gradient I times Delta Y U and V or
Delta X and Delta Y respectively plus
some high order terms right remember
Taylor expansion if you go infinite
series you get the exact solution but
we're just gonna say plus some high
order terms and then when we make those
higher order terms go away
poof Wow doesn't it great I've got the
power right here all right then we say
that it's an approximation okay so we
say that x + uy plus V is approximately
the original image plus the gradient in
x times Delta X plus the green in Y
times Delta Y or B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
