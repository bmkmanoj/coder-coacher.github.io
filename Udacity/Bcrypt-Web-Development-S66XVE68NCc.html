you know all of this is good to
understand and most modern computers
hash passwords in just the same way I
showed you generally we you can use
sha-256 that works okay the problem with
most hashing functions is that they're
designed to be fast so generally this is
a good thing you know if you're gonna
use this hashing function you know to be
verifying your cookies and whatnot yeah
you want it to be fast you want to slow
down your web server verifying you know
cookie data all the time but for cases
like passwords when it's much more
likely that somebody's going to be
trying to brute-force you it'd be really
cool if we had a hashing function that
was both really good like sha-256 but
also kind of slow so that as computers
get faster and faster the hash function
stays the same speed and I'm about to
tell you about such a function it's
called decrypt the reason I didn't use
it in my last example is because it's
not built in the Python so it's not
super convenient for me to demonstrate
and I and I don't want to have you know
expect you to install it but you know in
the future outside this course instead
of sha-256 use bcrypt instead and your
life will be better and what be crypt B
crypt of school basically takes an extra
parameter which is how long do you want
this to take and it's neat so now you
have this function that will stay slow
forever because you can make it slow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
