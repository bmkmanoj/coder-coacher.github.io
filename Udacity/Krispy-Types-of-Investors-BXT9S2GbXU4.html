between a unicorn investor and sort of a
long tail investors the unicorn
investors looking for other investors to
pile on that's where they make their
money so a first investor in a unicorn
company will say hey you know what I
think this could be sold as a
billion-dollar company I'm going to put
in enough money to make the valuation a
billion dollars that sets off a press
cycle that press cycle is a feeding
frenzy and for other investors who want
to also pylon and as those other
investors pile on the first investor is
actually reaping the benefits of these
other additional pylons but that whole
business model of investors feeding on
investors is dependent on no drop in
valuation which requires continued
growth with the company that's been
invested in either in the technology
space the people space the market space
some metric that they consider important
has to keep getting bigger or more
valuable even though it's only perceived
value the whole business can fall apart
if the true value of the company is
never realized this is where tech
bubbles come from actually now in the
long tail investor side of things those
investors are actually interested in
legitimately helping bootstrap companies
and make them successful and sustainable
because they see the sustained long-term
value of investing in a spread of
different businesses that will be around
in 20 or 50 years it's that continued
growth but slowly without that
get-rich-quick kind of mentality those
of the investors actually I prefer
because it actually benefits society and
is a good place for you to put your
business trust</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
