take the form of a whole series of
potential strategies but what's
interesting is inside of each revenue
stream you may have different pricing
tactics let me say that again we just
talked about revenue streams if you
think about it we didn't talk about how
much to charge we talked about the
potential ways to charge licensing and
intermediation and and direct sales etc
but how do you think about pricing
itself how do you set prices so let's
take a look
pricing is kind of the tactics first
thing is you have to figure out what's
the revenue stream I'm going to use for
the customer segment but there are two
types of prices one is fixed pricing
fixed pricing is just like it sounds
there's no haggling here's how it is
it's the fixed price now fixed price you
could decide well how do I set that
price I'm going to take the cost of what
it takes me to build the product and I'm
going to add some fixed markup you know
whatever I think my profit should be and
it's very simple it's cost price markup
and this gets me to the minimum price in
the market but you know what I might
know something that my competitors don't
know because I've been out talking to
these customers for weeks or months and
I know that they actually value my
feature set my value proposition more
than my competitors and an existing
market I like know something no one
knows I know exactly how much they value
what I will offer so instead of pricing
based on cost I can actually price on
specific customer segments or on
features I know they need there's a
third type of fixed pricing and that's
called volume pricing it might be that
you want to encourage high volume
because you have economies of scale and
so you might price the product if you
buy in quantities of one to ten it's a
thousand dollars but if you buy in
quantities of ten to
hundreds nine hundred dollars and
therefore you could keep stepping up the
discount but boy if you buy in you know
hundreds of thousands or millions
instead of $1,000 we'll charge you
ninety-nine dollars know who does that
go talk to Intel in the semiconductor
manufacturers they want to encourage
high volume purchases and so they have
stepped pricing that is oriented to
create volume so cost plus markup value
pricing and volume price are all
examples of fixed pricing tactics but
there's another type of pricing that's
dynamic pricing and dynamic pricing it's
exactly what it sounds like dynamic
means it moves well how can you have
prices that kind of move I thought all
pricing is written down on a piece of
paper and never changes well if you ever
think about it pricing that you
negotiate yeah we kind of have this
price on paper but that's just the
starting point of a conversation
so negotiated prices is a dynamic price
but airlines are now a great example of
another type of dynamic pricing and
that's called yield management if you
think about it once an airplane takes
off they could no longer sell those
seats so a month before the flight those
seats might be $500 a week before those
seats might actually go up to $600 an
hour before those seats might drop down
to 99 dollars because that's planes
leave in if we have empty seats we're
not getting any revenue and so yield
management is actually pretty
interesting based on experience on time
etc and there's software programs and
industries like Airlines and car rentals
etc that have perishable the seats or
time actually are quite good at doing
this another type of dynamic pricing or
real-time markets stock market is a
real-time market and then auctions like
eBay another example of dynamic pricing
so again two types of pricing models
fixed and dynamic how do you know which
one to use
you've been out talking to customers how
do they currently buy and what's the
revenue stream
name that's associated with these kind
of pricing tactics you need to be
constantly thinking what's the right
revenue stream for the right segment and
within that what's the right pricing
model is it fixed or is that dynamic and
which one are you going to pick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
