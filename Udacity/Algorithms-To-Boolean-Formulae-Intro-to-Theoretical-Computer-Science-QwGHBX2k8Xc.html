that into a boolean formula well that's
where cook and Levin had another
ingenious idea because they said you can
look at an algorithm running on a ram as
a series of snapshots and what I mean by
this is the following so assume you have
an algorithm on a non-deterministic Ram
that runs in polynomial time so you have
a point in time T equals zero that's
when your algorithm starts out then you
have T equals 1 T equals 2 so those are
the time steps here and the final time
step is going to be some polynomial of n
that is clear because we're looking at
an algorithm that solves a problem that
lies in NP so that means it only takes
polynomial time on a non-deterministic
Ram at least now if you look at what
happens on the RAM in each time step I
can basically draw you the following
picture if you recall from unit 1 what
the RAM looks like the RAM has only a
few components the RAM has a read-only
memory the RAM has a program or the
algorithm running so this algorithm here
is basically the program running and
just as I would write the algorithm line
by line by line I can also write it in
this way so this here would be the first
line of code then this would be the
second line of code and so on and
finally the RAM had a reading and
writing memory so we had some memory
cells here holding the variables and
those variables of course are changed by
the program depending on what's here in
the input and now comes the neat part
that cook and Levin observed because
what they observed is that when you look
at an algorithm working on the RAM then
you can depict that as a number of these
snapshots so if you say at T equals 0
these are the contents of the read-only
memory this is well actually we need
other information we also need to know
where the program is at but you can
basically say this is the input here
this is the program and this is the line
of the program that we're executing
right now and this here are the contents
of the readwrite memory so in the
beginning this will be empty but as the
algorithm works it will also put some
content in here and then of course the
program moves on maybe it also it can
also jump back and forth here and of
course we will have more and more
content
memory and at a certain point in time
the program will say I'm done and it
will hopefully have a certain output
here but since we're working with
decision problems actually it's only
interesting to us if the program says
yes or no at the end so for decision
problems we don't even really care about
what's what's in here we would care
about that if we were solving the
optimization problem or want additional
information but actually for a decision
problem it would just be important for
us to know at which line of code the
algorithm finishes if it finishes at a
return statement that will return yes to
us or a return statement that will
return no to us now let's have a closer
look at those snapshots and we'll
actually do that as a quiz so this here
is one snapshot I would like you to tell
me what we can say about a single
snapshot and also about all of these
snapshots here so there are three
statements for with each of which I
would like you to check this box if you
think they are true and otherwise leave
it blank
so the first claim you could make is
that each snapshot has size polynomial
and N and N it's the size of the input
as always secondly you could claim that
there can be an exponential number of
snapshots if we look at all of the time
steps and finally one claim that I would
like you to check out as well is all
snapshots if taken together so this
whole part here have polynomial size and
by polynomial size I again mean that
it's some polynomial of the input size n
that we're always using and you should
keep in mind that the algorithm that
we're looking at is an algorithm for a
problem in NP and it runs on a
non-deterministic Ram</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
