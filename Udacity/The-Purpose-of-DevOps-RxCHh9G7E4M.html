company or other organization is to
create value that value can be physical
or digital intellectual or social but
most companies or organizations are not
made with an idea of hey I want to
invest a lot of money and waste a lot of
employees time to make something that is
completely useless and worthless to
create value first you need an idea for
a product or service but having an idea
isn't nearly enough customers don't pay
for just ideas they want to see
something that does what they need a
functioning product a working service an
idea that you don't actually ship is
nothing but vaporware
there are often a lot of people involved
in taking a product or even just one
feature from idea to delivery and these
people have to communicate they have to
pass the product to be from one person
or team to another for design
implementation testing and delivery and
in the software business organizations
doing these things have often fallen
into a particular pattern or anti
pattern it's a pattern that can really
get in the way
this classic organizational structure
has strict borders between development
Quality Assurance operations and other
groups involved in delivering a product
to the user one team finishes their part
then passes the product in its current
shape to the next department for the
next step and no matter how efficient
the process is within single departments
if there are high walls between them
problems and inefficiencies creep in
ultra often there's not a lot of
communication between departments and
the attitude might be throw it over the
wall it's not our problem anymore we met
our deadline and if the customer at the
end throws the product back saying this
is not what I wanted then a nasty cycle
of blame can start this kind of
organization can have a lot of different
problems it tends to be slow and
ineffective at delivery it can't learn
from failures because people are blaming
one another it's hard to make changes
especially large and sweeping changes
operational problems tend to stack up
and become worse and everybody involved
is pretty unhappy these are challenges
that a lot of organizations faced
especially as teams and the services
they ran and got larger it got harder
for them to work together developers and
operations teams both technical
functions in the company but with
different interests and cultures seem to
be particularly badly affected in 2009
grassroots movement of practitioners
started that became what is now known as
DevOps this movement is experience-based
decentralized and open to all but it has
gained a lot of traction in both the
open source world and in big enterprise
companies and as the problems it solves
are becoming more and more apparent in
more and more companies so is the
adoption of DevOps growing but what
exactly is DevOps and how does it help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
