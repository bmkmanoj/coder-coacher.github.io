or smaller this operation is somewhat
different than translation and rotation
when we translate or rotate an object we
don't change its shape or its volume
these two operations are what are called
rigid body transforms the named rigid
body is just what it says if you have an
object and apply any number of rotations
and translations to it you won't change
its shape it's as if the object is made
out of something well rigid and will
keep its form scaling does change an
object's overall size so it's not a
rigid body transform scaling in three
j/s is simple enough just as there's a
translation and rotation parameter on
the object there is also a scale
parameter here's the code to make a
balloon object three times as large as
it was before note that unlike real life
this makes the balloon three times
larger in all ways the thickness of the
skin the part where you seal it off and
so on like rotation scaling is done with
respect to an origin since the valve of
the balloon is at the origin the valve
will stay still and the balloon will
expand upwards in fact you can scale an
object differently along each of the
three axes x y and z this code is
scaling the object along the y axis but
not the other two
a number less than 1 means you're making
the object smaller the scale shown here
has the effect of compressing it along
the y axis when you scale an object the
same amount in all directions like we
did with a balloon this is called
uniform scaling if the scale varies it's
called non-uniform scaling uniform
scaling does not change any angles
within the model itself non-uniform
scaling can modify angles in other words
the shape of the model itself is changed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
