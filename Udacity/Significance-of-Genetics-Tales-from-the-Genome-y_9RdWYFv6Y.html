and what will become of us in the future
there are so many big questions out
there that science specifically genetics
has some amazing answers for now in this
course so far we've just begun to
understand the fundamentals that
scientists and researchers are using
every day to try to answer these
questions if you've made it this far
then you've been equipped with the
essential knowledge you need to go to
the next step all you need to do is keep
asking questions and fan the flame of
curiosity and doubt genetics is the
central subject tying all the major
facets of biology together and
explaining the driving force behind
evolution now while the future of
personalized medicine is about to come
crashing down on top of us whether we
want it to or not my passion for
genetics remains rooted in the simple
curiosity about the origin of life and
the human condition I think Malcolm pots
and Rogers short summed it up best and
their biology textbook about the
evolution of human sexuality at one
extreme there are those who like to
think that a chicken is merely an egg's
way of making another egg or maybe as
Richard Dawkins would have it the soma
is merely the product of an ageless
battle between selfish genes striving
for mastery and seeking propagation
through succeeding generations our life
on Earth has not been a series of
discontinuous acts of creation but it is
an unbroken thread tying us all to our
ancestors and with the potential of
linking us to innumerable future
generations we are indeed trailing
clouds of glory the glory of billions of
years of continuous evolution we do not
create life we have only the privilege
of passing it on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
