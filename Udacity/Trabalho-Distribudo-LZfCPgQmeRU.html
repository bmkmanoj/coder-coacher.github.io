entire ledger say we had more people to
help like the staff of your accounting
department well split them into two
groups called the mappers and the
reducers then we'll take the ledger
break it into chunks give each chunk to
one of the mappers that way all the
mappers can work at the same time each
over a small fraction of the data let's
see what a mapper would do they will
take the first record in their ledger
and on an index card write the name of
the store and the amount of the sale
then they'll take the next record and
repeat as they're writing the index
cards they'll pile them up so that cards
for the same store go in the same pile
by the end each mapper will have a pile
of cards per store once the mappers have
finished the reducers can collect their
sets of cards will tell each reducer
which store they're responsible for such
as this one for New York City and this
one for Miami in Los Angeles the
reducers go to the mappers and retrieve
the pile of cards for their stores it's
fast for them to do because the mappers
have already separated the cards into a
pile per store once the reducers have
retrieved all their data they collect
all the small piles and create a larger
pile then they start going through the
piles one at a time all they have to do
at this point is add up all the amounts
from all the cards in the pile that
gives them a total sales for that store
they can then write that amount on their
final sheet to keep things organized
each reducer goes through his or her set
of piles in alphabetical order
in other words Los Angeles before Miami</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
