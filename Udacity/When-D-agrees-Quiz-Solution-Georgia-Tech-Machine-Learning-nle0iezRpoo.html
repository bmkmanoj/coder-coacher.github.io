so you kind of were walking us through
it but basically if Y I and H T agree
that means they're both negative or
they're both positive they're equal to
each other so when we multiply them
together we get 1 1 times whatever our
alpha thing is some positive number is
going to be positive
we're negating that so it's negative e
to the negative something is something
between 0 and 1 less than less than 1 so
that's gonna scale it down so it looks
like and you know assuming the
everything else goes ok with with the
way that the normalization happens right
it seems like it could be depends on the
normalization ah so by the way that's a
good point the Z sub T is in fact
whatever normalization constant you need
at time T in order to make it all work
out to be a distribution correct then
it's not gonna it's not gonna change
true but if some of them are corrected
some of they're incorrect the ones that
are correct are gonna decrease and the
ones that are incorrect are going to
increase that's right so what's the
answer to the quiz depends that's true
it does that is exactly the right answer
it depends on what else is going on
you're correct but I think it should be
decreases like that's really mainly what
happens that's also fair the answer is
if this one is correct that is they
agree and you disagree on at least some
of them at least one one other example
it will in fact decrease so I could ask
a similar question which is well what
happens when they disagree and at least
one other example agrees then what
happens yeah then then it should
increase oh oh it's gonna put more
weight on the ones that it's getting
wrong exactly and the ones that are
getting wrong must be the ones that are
harder or at least that's the underlying
idea all right Michael so you got it to
the understand of the equations for yeah
it seemed really scary at first but it
seems you know marginally less scary now
because all that it's doing it's doing
it in a particular way I don't know why
it's doing in this particular way but
all it seems to be doing is the answers
that it had it was getting wrong it puts
more weight on those and the ones that
it's getting right it puts less weight
on those and then it you know the loop
goes around again and it tries to make a
new classifier
right and since the ones that it's
getting wrong are getting more and more
weight but we're guaranteed or at least
we've assumed that we have a weak
learner that will always do better than
chance on any distribution it means that
you will always be able to output some
learner that can get at least some of
the ones that you were getting wrong
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
