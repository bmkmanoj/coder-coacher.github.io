have noticed that when news comes out
about a particular company its stock
price can change considerably why is
that well the stock price is of course
the main mechanism by which investors
can essentially let their view of the
stock be known in other words if they
think that the company is valued less
they're gonna sell in the price is going
to go down if investors think the value
of the company should go up they're
going to buy the stock and the price is
going to go up now why is it that this
information or news affects the stock
price it's based on these things that
we've covered up to now in the lesson in
other words intrinsic value book value
and well of course market capitalization
but let's take a look at how it affects
say intrinsic value consider a company
run by this CEO and assume for the
moment that his business his company is
to grow and sell coconuts what if the
following news comes out the CEO is ill
maybe he has cancer maybe he's got
something else that prevents him from
collecting those coconuts as effectively
as you might otherwise do well certainly
that should affect the stock price
downward because the probability that we
are going to get dividends in the future
is decreasing either that or the amount
of the dividends is going to decrease so
if you think back to the intrinsic
valuation that we talked about the
potential for reduced future dividends
reduces the value of the company
significantly now consider another
scenario where there's an island with
our original company and another company
and news comes out about the soil on the
island being contaminated that news is
going to affect not only our original
company but also all the other companies
on the island so you can think of this
sort of news as being sector news and
it relates to the sector of growing
coconuts on this island and it affects
all the companies in the sector let's
consider one last scenario where we have
many islands with many companies on
those islands and news that might affect
all of them like sea level rising that
is going to negatively impact all of
these companies so we have examples here
of company specific news that affects
the price of a individual company sector
specific news that affects say the
companies on a particular Island or in a
particular industrial segment and market
wide news that affects all the companies
in the market so that's how news can
affect the prices of the stock primarily
because they reduce the expectation of
future dividends we've seen how that can
affect the intrinsic value and
accordingly why people would want to pay
less for that stock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
