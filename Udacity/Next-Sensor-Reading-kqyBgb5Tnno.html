way i just copied over see the the load
the density on the bottom i just copied
over that's the belief that the robot
has the robot sees another hole so that
means P of Z given X is the same thing I
had before because I got the same
reading I had before I saw a whole and
again i multiply but this time i
multiply the previous density by this
and you'll notice now that the robot has
a lot of belief okay that it's actually
where it really is and the reason is is
it saw a hole it took a meter it took a
step of 2 meters saw another hole
megan's really hoping i don't go another
2 meters i won't and just that amount of
information is enough for it to have a
pretty good belief about where it is
okay there's still some probability that
it's over here because if that previous
reading was just wrong and the current
reading was right that I might be there
same over here if the current reading
was right but the previous reading was
wrong nope the other way around anyway
the idea is that it sits waiting these
different probabilities okay and you
could you know do it again so you
resample and you move and you see here
we have the resample density where most
of its belief is in the right place and
there's some densities there and that's
it and that's the way particle filter
works okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
