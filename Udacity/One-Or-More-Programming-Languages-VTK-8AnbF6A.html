problem is to write out what sorts of
strings are matched there are things
like one space 11 space one two three
because of this plus two space 4 5 6 and
so on and one of the things that we
notice quickly is that they all have a
space they all start with a single digit
and they don't have any letters in them
so is a 1 space 2 part of the possible
return value well it would have to match
this regular expression and be in the
string it's in the string but it doesn't
match this regular expression because it
starts with an A and none of our things
start with an a about 1 space 2 oh that
looks pretty good we have one space 1
and we could pick a different digit and
it's in the string so it could be part
of our return value 1 space to be it is
in the string but we never have any
letters in this regular expression so it
doesn't match to space 3 this has the
right format it matches our regular
expression but it's not actually in the
haystack string so it can't be part of
the return value 44 this has the wrong
format we need to space in the middle
three space 44 this has the right format
it matches our regular expression and it
actually occurs in the string great
three space for 4d this has the wrong
format again we're not matching any
letters so just these two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
