queue MV diagrams here we started by
asking questions as to how one should
detect anomalies in data we thought we
could detect outliers and distributions
we inspected distributions and looked at
correlations between them we derived
certain variables we used two variables
to form some model the models we looked
at could have been parametric
nonparametric or mathematical we
concentrated on the non parametric
models and derive some single variable
kernel density estimates from the single
variate kernel density estimate we
looked for optimal models we used mean
integrated square error to look for
optimal bandwidth we introduced the KL
divergence we also form some
multivariate kernel density estimators
and looked at joint probability
distribution functions for the
multivariate methods we looked at
outliers in the models we use
Mahalanobis distance to find the
outliers and we left it up to you to
find out what these outliers may mean in
our data this completes this part of our
lesson at this point we will leave
behind this diagram however you can see
there are many points we could have
further enhanced this diagram in fact
this is always the case with our qm v
diagrams to find the flow of logic in
model building process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
