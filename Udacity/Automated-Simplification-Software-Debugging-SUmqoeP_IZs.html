scheme obviously simplification works
but if you as a human do simplification
you may not be entirely happy with it
that is because Manuel simplification is
tedious and boring that is because
Manuel simplification is Ted use because
you have to run these tests manually
again and again and again second it's
boring because it's a rather mechanical
activity without great intellectual
challenge I mean we just keep on
tripping away some input invoke the
program again and again and again who
really wants to do this fortunately
there's an answer to that we do have
something that helps us specifically for
tedious and boring activities and this
is called a computer because we invented
automated machines precisely to relieve
us from tedious and boring tasks so
we're going to hand over the process of
simplification over to a machine
resulting in automated simplification
can we do that for automated
simplification we need two ingredients
we need a strategy that does the
simplification for us basically that
tells us how to simplify and we need an
automated test that checks whether a
simplification succeeded or not let's
first start with the automated test for
the Mozilla example we would need a test
that takes HTML input starch the Mozilla
web browser feeds the HTML input into
the browser and then finally checks
whether Mozilla fails or whether it
succeeds and all of this needs to go
into our automated test there is a
number of ways to set up such tests for
instance we could start Mozilla and then
replay appropriate user events and see
whether it crashes or not we could also
write JavaScript programs and have
Mozilla execute them automatically that
is we'd write a piece of JavaScript that
would read the HTML input and then check
whether this causes a crash or not for
this course however we'll set up a
simulation that will do the very same
thing but actually without involving
Mozilla we will simply write a look
Python function that does all the
testing for us and all of this
automatically on the machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
