been out of work for four years yet an
unspectacular career before that how
would the millions of people like me
like Elm get a say in the future and
help to bring it about Udacity is a very
meaningful central part of that answer
that is it is now possible without
getting a lot of permission or spending
a lot of money to go train yourself to
be deeply skilled and knowledgeable in
areas that are valuable making it
evident that you have those skills is a
very critical step to going and getting
people that take you seriously and
letting you be involved in these
processes I know that it's trite but
believing in yourself feeling that you
have it the world is no obligation to
include you and at the same time the
world has no reason to exclude you and
if you believe in yourself I don't see
any reason why you can't get more
involved over time by doing things like
training yourself up you know if I were
starting over from the beginning right
now I would find the most exciting place
I could find and I would offer to do
anything there if I were coming here to
Udacity and you didn't know me and this
is where I wanted to be i would say i'm
going to be running this place in five
years but you have no reason to believe
that let me wash your dishes let me
sweep your floor i don't care what it is
as long as you're committed to paying
attention and giving me a little bit
more room every time I show that i have
the capability i'll start however low i
need to so you can build confidence
that's what i would do I actually think
it's healthy to start over I encourage
people to start a new career at least
once a decade because at some point you
get a little stale in whatever career
you're in part of the power of
entrepreneurship is the naivete that it
comes from not knowing all of the rules
in your industry but once you've been in
that industry and done really well for a
decade or more you are one of the
experts who is despite all
of your attempts received the blinders
that come from knowing that the
quote-unquote right way to do so pick a
feed is not in the feet of expertise at
least once a decade so many students
want to be like you and wanna contribute
want to have the freedom to do crazy
things what can they take away today but
together differently but can you give
them as it as a last piece of advice to
unleash their potential live without
fear if you make choices based on all
the bad things that could happen and
spend your time thinking about what you
can lose you won't get most of what you
want and if you embrace life with
passion and without fear it won't always
go perfectly living without fear is a
fairly magical choice to make that would
be my recommendation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
