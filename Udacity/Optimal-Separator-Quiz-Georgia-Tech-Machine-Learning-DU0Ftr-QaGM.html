tiny graph on the screen can you see it
yes okay and some points are positive
some points are negative and let's just
imagine for the sake of argument that
the Green Line that I've drawn between
them is in fact the optimal separator it
probably isn't but let's just pretend
that I drew the right one now I've just
told you that a lot of the alphas are
going to be zero and some of them are
not so thinking about everything that
we've said and thinking about what it
means to build just what it means to
build an optimal decision boundary
maximizing the margin I want you to
point to one of the positive examples
that almost certainly is not going to
have a nonzero alpha and one of the
minus examples that almost certainly is
not going to have a nonzero alpha that
is are not a part of the support vectors
you want something that does not not
have a zero don't confuse me you want
something that's that that has a zero
alpha or a nonzero alpha I want
something that has a zero alpha got it
that is in some sense doesn't matter
okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
