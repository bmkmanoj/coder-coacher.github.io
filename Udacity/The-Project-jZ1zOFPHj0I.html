working on in this course you'll be
using some common development packaging
deployment and monitoring tools to build
a smooth workflow for building and
launching changes to a web application
although you'd be working by yourself
we'll talk about how you'll be able to
apply the ideas you learn here to your
own workplace or future projects you'll
start with fixing a common problem
difference between development and
production environment by creating
golden images that can be used by
developers and on production alike then
you'll step into the shoes of a
developer and use the golden image from
the previous step to launch a local
development server for our web app after
that you'll build out a continuous
integration service a system that will
watch for check-ins of new code and
automatically run tests and package it
up then you go back to the developer
role and see how pushing your changes to
your team repository automatically makes
changes to the integration environment
and since you can't improve what you
can't measure you'll configure a simple
monitoring system that will allow you to
see how your system is performing you'll
also see how the perspective of what
important things to monitor depends on
the role you're playing this of course
is not the only way to implement some of
the DevOps principles in an organization
or a project but it will give you a
practical overview and let you walk in
the shoes of different people for a
while it will help you to better
understand some of the challenges other
teams face teach you how to communicate
with them better and how to work
together to solve the problems you're
facing in your everyday work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
