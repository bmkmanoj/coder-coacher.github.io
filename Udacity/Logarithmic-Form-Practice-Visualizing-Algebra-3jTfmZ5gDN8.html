logarithmic form nice work if you got
all three right now some of these were
tough so it's okay if you didn't get all
them right let's walk through each of
them for the first one we'll have our
base be 10 and we'll have our answer b5
when we take the log with base 10 of
some number will get 5 it means that
this number must be a hundred thousand
the log base 10 of 100,000 equals five
it's the power that we raise 10 to in
order to get a hundred thousand for the
second one will use the same process we
have a base of 4 so this is the
logarithm with a base for the result of
our logarithm equals negative 3 it's the
exponent and this leaves one
sixty-fourth here as the argument for
our logarithm it's the number that we
take the logarithm of and finally for
the last one we use the same technique
our base of our logarithm is too since
this base is to the result of our
logarithm is X this is the exponent and
we're taking log base 2 of the number
three to get X now keep in mind in this
last equation we weren't really solving
for x we were just trying to write this
in logarithmic form it turns out that
this number X is really equal to log
base two of 3 now the logarithm in your
calculator can get this number the log
in your calculator has a base of 10 but
there are other ways to get basis of two
we won't cover that in this course but
if you're interested do some research</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
