example just to contrast the notion of
fast memory obliviousness to fast memory
awareness consider the problem of
sequential reduction let's start by
reviewing the fast memory aware version
it scans the list in units of size l to
match the memory transfer size notice
that l is an explicit variable or
parameter of the algorithm but at least
the algorithm is IO optimal it performs
just an over L transfers by contrast
suppose that the hardware in the
operating system managed fast memory for
you for instance maybe you already know
about caches from the OMS cshp CA course
if so you could regard this Hardware
managed fast memory as a cache or maybe
you know about virtual memory and
translation lookaside buffer from the
OMS CS operating systems class if so you
can imagine the operating system and
hardware acting in concert to move pages
of data from disk to main memory they
would swap pages out of main memory
which would be the fast memory in this
case back and forth to disk whenever
main memory is full in either case the
purpose of the automatic systems is to
let you write the conventional algorithm
it's a lot simpler because fast memory
is automatically manage the algorithm
doesn't need to move data around
explicitly the automatic system takes
each read or write checks if the data is
already in fast memory if so it returns
the value and otherwise it goes too slow
memory in order to retrieve the value
and if it retrieves the value of course
it'll do transfers in blocks of size l
notice that the conventional algorithm
makes no references to Z or L thus we
say that the algorithm is oblivious to
fast memory so if we had a good model of
how automatic data movement works we'll
be able to analyze conventional
algorithms and say how many memory
transfers would they incur given such a
model will be able to analyze
conventional algorithms and in this case
showed that the conventional way to do a
reduction also incurs just an over L
transfers this discussion points out to
questions which is what this lesson is
all about first what should we assume
about how the automatic system behaves
secondly can we create algorithms
without Z or L parameters that
nevertheless match the performance of
algorithms that do use Z and
parameters that's what we mean by
oblivious though of course we mean it in
a positive sense one last note about
terminology we will by convention refer
to this fast memory as cash it's just a
shortcut sometimes cash really means a
virtual memory backed main memory for
disk it helps that it's a lot easier to
say cache oblivious apen automatic fast
memory oblivious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
