start taking action towards the ideas
you have for your business
let's start by breaking down your
mission and vision statements into a set
of 12 month goals for your 12-month
goals try to answer questions like how
many customers do you want to have how
much revenue do you hope to make and
what metrics are you looking at to help
you get there
there are plenty of other questions you
can ask and this really depends on the
type of impact you're hoping to have
with your business
here's a strategy you can use to help
get started try thinking about a core
objective that's fundamental to the
success of your business
for example maybe your app needs lots of
users can you imagine making any
progress at all and gaining these users
how many do you think you could get
write that number down now and what
timeframe do you think it would take to
reach that goal once you have that
number you can adjust it relative to
what portion of the goal could be
achieved within the next year let's look
at an example of how you might be able
to use this for your business
I feel pretty confident that I could get
10 customers in a month so maybe a
hundred and twenty customers is a good
goal for my first year or if 5,000
customers in my first five years seems
reasonable that maybe I could reach a
thousand customers by the end of your
one start where you're comfortable and
work from there another idea you can
tries to look into similar businesses
seeing where they started and finding
out how they were able to grow over time
and remember these goals can change the
idea right now is to really just get
something to work from later on so take
some time to think about where you hope
to be in one year and when you're ready
right out your 12-month goals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
