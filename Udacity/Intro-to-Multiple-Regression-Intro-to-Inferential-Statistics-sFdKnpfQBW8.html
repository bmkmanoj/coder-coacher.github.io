optional but it's really cool and it
will only take a few minutes to go
through so far we've only used one
predictor variable in the case before
the predictor was the distance traveled
and we were using that to predict the
flight cost but oftentimes there are
many factors that can predict the
dependent variable when we use multiple
predictors we're doing multiple
regression the purpose is to explain
more of the variation in Y basically we
regress Y on predictor 1 predictor 2 all
the way to however many predictors we
want why don't we just do a simple
linear regression for each one the
reason we just have one equation is not
only because it's easier but also
because when we include several
predictors we can calculate the
relationship that each predictor has
with Y independently of the other
predictors for example in my master's
thesis I wanted to look at things that
impact student effort and math class
remember that effort is a construct so I
measured this by things like whether or
not they did their homework and time
spent studying a lot of things can
influence effort specifically I was
interested in how much students value
mathematics do they believe that math
will help them in their careers and also
how much they enjoy math class and their
relationship with their teachers it's
possible that having a good relationship
with their teachers can make them enjoy
school more and if they enjoy school
more they'll put forth more effort or
maybe students place value on subjects
that they enjoy when we include all of
these as predictors we no longer have a
simple slope instead we get regression
coefficients for each predictor variable
these will be numbers just like how
before when we had one variable we found
the slope and that was our regression
coefficient in this case we'll have
three these coefficients tell us the
rate of change in Y given a one unit
change in each respective variable
holding the others constant in other
words we see the mathematical influence
of one variable while statistically
controlling for the influence of the
other variable
we could go into more detail but we
won't multiple regression is not usually
covered in elementary statistics courses
but it's still valuable to know about
and be able to interpret apart from the
regression coefficients most programs
that conduct multiple regression will
also provide a multiple correlation
coefficient called R this is similar in
interpretation to Pearson's R but it
involves one outcome a response variable
and more than one predictor variable
this tells us the strength of the
relationship between y and the combined
set of predictors usually we're more
interested in r-squared which tells us
the proportion of variability in Y
explained by our set of predictors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
