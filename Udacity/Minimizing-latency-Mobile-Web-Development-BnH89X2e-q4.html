order to minimize network latency is to
minimize the number of HTTP requests and
a major major way to do this is to avoid
page redirects each redirect can cause a
DNS lookup a TCP connect and the sending
of the actual HTTP request itself all
over again HTTPS has even more round
trips per connection so you're looking
at high hundreds of milliseconds per
redirects as a penalty at least if you
have a legitimate need for redirects for
example if you've moved a resource
that's great but use a 301 redirect if
you can lots of browsers will actually
update links then you also want to
eliminate render blocking resources like
waiting on multiple style sheets or
fonts or the like anything that forces
the browser to wait for another HTTP
transaction to complete before it can
render the app is going to be much more
noticeable on mobile so combined and
minify those stylesheets kids this also
includes avoiding blocking rendering by
waiting for the download of javascript
files if you can use async or defer on
script to let the content render as soon
as possible in short you want to
prioritize the network transactions of
whatever you need to render the initial
page full of content make sure you're
loading images on that first page first
before ones that may be down in the
bottom of the page get that first page
on the screen as quickly as possible you
should obsess over the network page in
the developer tools to make sure you're
loading items in the correct order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
