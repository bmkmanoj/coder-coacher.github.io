explore duality in the context of the
maximum flow problem as well we can cast
it as a linear programming by letting
fuv be the flow and letting CUV be the
capacity along an edge UV our goal is to
maximize the flow out of the source
subject to the conservation of flow
constraint and the capacity constraints
and of course flows must be non-negative
as well to express the dual will use
whyyou for the conservation constraints
and y UV for the capacity constraints
two subscripts mean a capacity
constraint one subscript means a
conservation constraint the dual problem
is to minimize the sum over all the
edges of y UV x c UV note that the WIU's
have no role in the objective function
because their coefficients are 0 the
constraints for the dual involve several
cases we'll consider first
those arising from the objective
function coefficients for edges out of
the source being 1 these flows appear
once in the capacity constraints in once
for the receiving vertex for the flow in
their conservation equation the case for
edges going into the sink is analogous
the flow is present in the capacity
constraints and then the conservation of
flow constraint for the sending vertex
for all other edges the flow appears in
the capacity constraint and in the
conservation equations for both the
sending and the receiving vertex and of
course these dual variables have to be
non-negative the interpretation of these
dual variables can be a little tricky so
I'm going to rearrange them to isolate
the two indexed variables the ones
corresponding to edges and the ones that
appear in the objective function on the
left hand side this makes it a little
easier to see what's going on actually I
think this would make a good exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
