with no runtime checks at all and you're
supposed to do the debugging we're in
that program should you start i would
suggest the first thing to do is to
define data invariant these will
immediately cover large parts of the
program state and catch lots and lots of
defects the next thing is to provide
preconditions which check the data
invariance of course but which also
check specific preconditions for the
functions that have finally provide post
condition in any method you find suspect
start with partial conditions and then
you expand them further and further to
capture more and more of the correct
behavior why do we start with data
invariants and preconditions well
because they're usually way easier to
write catch lots of bugs and because we
only care about whether a method works
or not if it actually gets the correct
argument and gets a correct state to
begin with them on top of that if you're
using C or C++ run a system invariant
checker you should run a system
invariant checker for the simple reason
that it will check for all sorts of
memory corruption and if your program
does have any issues with memory
corruption then all of these other
assertions are totally moved because
they will come up with random results
running a tool like valgrind can detect
lots and lots of memory issues and all
it takes is to run your program once
with valgrind enabled a colleague of
mine recently transferred from academia
to an oil and gas company and he was in
charge of testing he introduced the
first assertion ever in their code and
immediately this one single assertion
uncovered dozens of bugs the engineers
were amazed they had never seen anything
like this before and this is an
experience well I'm not exactly sure
whether you should have that experience
too but if you come along with code that
has no assertion that all start adding
some and you will be surprised why
should we start with data invariants
this is the quiz first option they cover
much of the state second option they are
frequently checked they form implicit
pre and post conditions because data
invariants should hold at the beginning
and at the end of each public method
final option they provide
helpful documentation because they
document exactly how the data structure
is organized and which assumptions
programmers should not violate check all
that apply over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
