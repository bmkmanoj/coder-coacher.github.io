inferencing just to kind of get a feel
for it for certain kinds of networks we
actually can do things exactly and we're
gonna look at one of those examples in
just a moment but it turns out it's
helpful to remind ourselves of some
rules of probability and inference that
will help us do that so here's just it's
kind of like a little cheat sheet for
you so marginalization is this idea that
we can represent the probability of a
value by summing over some other
variable and looking at the joint
probabilities of those and if you have
trouble remembering this one this this
is how I like to think about it if we're
trying to figure out the probability of
X then one week at one thing we can do
is break it up and break the world up
into well the cases where X and not Y
plus places where x and y so the
probability of X is it can be broken
down into the probability of X when y is
false plus the probability of X when y
is true so it's really simple in that
sense but it actually turns out to be a
useful thing to be able to do to
marginalize out the chain rule we've
used this a bunch of times the
probability of x and y can be written as
the probability of x times the
probability of y given x and that's
important that we have the given X if we
drop that what is that implying other
than just yeah well if you drop it then
that implies that they are completely
independent of one another right that in
in the case where the variables are
independent you can just look at the
product in the general case you actually
have to look at the second one given the
first one right and as I recall the
order on the left it doesn't matter so
you have the probability of x times the
probability of Y given X but you could
have written the probability of Y times
the probability of x given Y yes and
actually let's do a quick quiz okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
