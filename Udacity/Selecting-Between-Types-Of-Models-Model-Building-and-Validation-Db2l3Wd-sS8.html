to select between different models
before we do that let's do a quick recap
from where we left off with selected
features using distances sampled over
time we investigated how many features
we should select we made sure we had
enough data for the chosen features we
use the frequency of the data to
validate that we have enough data we
also wanted to make sure the data is
good enough to distinguish patterns we
did this by visually inspecting the
scatter plots and making sure that our
chosen features will have a
discriminating power we have discussed
how best to choose our features and how
that can affect the final validity of
our models through analysis of errors
and model complexity once we have a good
idea of the feature set and a clear
definition of the problem statement we
can build many different types of model
to identify different cars from are
connected cars data set we are now ready
to make the statement of the model we
want to use classification model to
distinguish between B and F we can do so
by using several different classifiers
in this case we have chosen three a
logistic regression a support vector
machine based classifier and a random
forest base classifiers each of these
learning algorithms are topic unto
itself and we will not attempt to cover
the basics of these assuming you have
used or seen most of these topics in a
machine learning course if you would
like to have a refresher please look at
the material in the instructors notes
after we build the three models we will
look at ways to measure the performance
of each model and then be able to make a
choice between the models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
