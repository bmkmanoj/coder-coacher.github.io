a little bit about a type of data that
we'll be working with in a number of
places in the rest of this course so I'm
sure you're aware that Wikipedia in
addition to the article text for many
types of data also includes info box
data now info box data is essentially
structured data that complements the
subject of the article in this case this
is an article for the city of Hyderabad
and in addition to a description of the
city here and other interesting
information about the city we have data
in the form of population land area in
square kilometers as well as a number of
other useful pieces of data about this
city
now Wikipedia has info boxes for a lot
of different types of data people
animals automobiles and so on an
organization called dbpedia has taken
the info box data from Wikipedia and
produced it as a collection of data sets
that we can download here's the
description of some of the data sets
themselves and some of the details about
them now in our case we're going to be
working with the city's data set this
data is distributed as a CSV file that
we can download that contains all of the
info box data for a particular snapshot
in time for all cities described on
Wikipedia for which there is info box
data now in order to prepare this data
as CSV the dbpedia folks had to do a
little bit of work in encoding it to get
certain types of data values into
individual cells let's take a look at
the city's data set we're going to look
here in Excel because this data is so
dense we really do need the added
structure that the spreadsheet app
provides so here's the row for Hyderabad
and there are about 20,000 rows in this
CSV file so lots of cities are
represented here and we can see that
there are lots of null cell values this
is coding in this data set which
indicates that there is no value
supplied for that particular piece of
data now something it's also important
to bear in mind is that while this data
is actually in pretty good shape it's
entirely human generated you can edit it
by editing the Wikipedia page as usual
there are some of that data here so what
this means of course is that there's a
lot of dirty data here the
that's going to need to be cleaned up so
this data set provides a nice example of
wrangling data because we're going to
have to decode some of the fields in
order to get them into the form that we
want we're going to be looking at
transforming these lines of data into
JSON documents and then eventually
storing them into MongoDB let's take a
look at a couple of examples of the
tasks that we have ahead of us okay this
is the postal code field and we can see
that there are lots of different formats
represented here something else that's
interesting about this data is the way
they've encoded arrays some fields have
multiple values stored within them
here's the UTC offset field and in this
case we can see that there are two
values for the UTC offset for this city
and a couple of others here there's two
different values that represent the UTC
offset for when the city is on daylight
savings time versus when it's not and
you can see that we have some HTML
entities represented here and some
Unicode characters and some other
characters that we are going to need to
do a little work with so we've got our
work cut out for us with this data in
terms of pulling it out of the CSV form
parsing it into individual fields and
cleaning up some of the problematic data
that's here after that then we'll take a
look at getting it into MongoDB so as
you can see this data set provides a
nice opportunity for us to explore
things like auditing a data set to see
where the problems lie and then thinking
about exactly what we should do with
feels like this and other structures
that we're going to find in this data
set and then finally we'll take a look
at putting this data into MongoDB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
