numbers I can so the first one's pretty
easy because we did that once when we
were talking in a couple of slides back
we can't we just look at the case where
storm is set to be true those are those
two mega rows there and their point two
five and point four just add that up and
we get 0.65 worth pointing out that
since we know that s is 0.65 we know
that not s is 0.35 okay okay even though
that table really has two numbers in it
we only need one of them right yes very
good point because it's a constrained by
you need to add up to 1 and then we do
something similar with lightning we look
at the cases where lightning is true and
S is also true yep there's just one case
like that huh right but what we really
want to know is what's the probability
that lightning is true given that storm
is true so we need to think about both
cases where storm is true and say of
these what's the probability that storm
that lightning is true and it's linked
to 5 over 0.65 right which is 0.38 5
rounded up okay cowboy right which means
that the probability of not L given s is
1 minus that or 0.6 1 5 that's right
okay so we do the same trick with
probability they'll give it not as so we
find the case where lightning is true
but storm is false and that's point O 5
but we have to do it out of both cases
where S is false and so it's 0.05
divided by point 0.05 divided by 0.3 5
which is 1/7 and 1/7 is approximately
0.143 rounded up and so not L given not
s is 0.85 7 nicely done I use
subtraction in my head in your head yeah
but it was like with carries and stuff
that was nice so and right so let's see
and these sorts of things make sense so
if it's not a storm it's kind of
unlikely that we'll see lightning or
there is a storm it's moderately common
that we'll see you later
ok that makes sense ok good so now we do
the same trick again with thunder except
now instead of looking at L and s we
look at thunder and lightning so we need
to look at the case where thunder is
true
and lightning is true so that would be
point that's all the cases where
lightning is true so it would be point
two divided by 0.25 all right and why
are we just looking at the case where
storm is true where we're doing it
because it's conditionally independent
of storm there's no other information so
it doesn't matter which way as we look
at what matters is we look at a case
where thunder and lightning are both
true and we compare that to thunder as
false and lightning is true so that's
this number those add up to the point
two five we get the point two over the
point two five which is point eight
right so it's very likely to hear
thunder if you see lightning that makes
sense and there's only a 20% chance that
you don't hear thunder when you hear
lightning
you're just lightning not thunder yep so
we do the same thing in the case where
we have thunder and there's not
lightning so we find that row okay not
lightning and there is thunder there's
wine right and we do the same trick we
did before and we get a point O four
over a point four I think we did last
time actually and we get the point one
we did so if it's there's not lightning
out it's very unlikely to hear thunder
right alright and just to just to drive
this point home that was that was great
just to drive this point home what if it
was the case that it mattered what's
what value storm had how are we gonna
fill in this table well we'd have to
look a lot more rows well in particular
we couldn't draw this kind of belief
network if that were the case because it
wouldn't be conditionally independent so
we'd have to draw basically another edge
here and what that represents is that
thunder to work out that what the
probability of thunder is you have to
look at storm and lightning that all the
joint combinations are those to make it
work and that's right and that's
something that threw me when I started
to look at this because the picture
looks a lot like a neural net right and
a neural net you've got these nodes
you've got arrows going into the nodes
and when you have a bunch of arrows
going into the same node you just end up
like adding all those different
influences together weighted by what's
what it has on the weight this belief
Network representation is an entirely
different animal in particular now what
we're really saying is to work out the
value of this node you need to know
what's going on in all combinations of
what the inputs are and so as you
pointed out so astutely that grows
exponentially as you have more variables
coming into the node higher in degree
huh so this is not just a net
work it's a graph and so we can talk
about parents and children right so
basically the number of numbers you have
to keep track of is exponential in your
number in your parents I mean it's a yes
though it's not exactly a tree doesn't
have to be a tree so the parent
relationships are kind of weird like in
particular if you use parent terminology
on this graph what you're saying is that
lightning has one parent which is storm
and thunder has two parents which are
storm and lightning
so it's storm is its own grandfather and
parent so let me ask you a quick
question Michael so earlier on when you
were describing this this graph I
noticed you used the word dependencies
you said we're gonna capture the
dependencies so if you erase the red
line between storm and thunder I'd be
happy to so you raise that should I read
this as storms cause lightning and
lightning causes thunder you can do that
but you'd be wrong okay
you can't infer that there is a causal
relationship just because there's an
arrow between them right so these arrows
really are just telling us about the
relationships between the probabilities
and not necessarily anything about the
physical processes that underlie them
okay the only thing certain I understand
so what you're saying is it would be
very natural to look at a belief network
or a Bayesian net or a Bayes net or a
graphical model and read the arrows as
causes and therefore read them as
talking about dependencies but actually
what's happening here is that these
things represent conditional
independencies so it is not true that
lightning is dependent on storm and
thunder is depending on lightning so
much as it's the case that storm and
thunder are conditionally independent
given light that's that is a good point
I actually never really realized that
dependence you use the word dependence
sometimes it means a physical dependence
like in the real world that's dependent
here I'm just talking about statistical
dependence it's really just talking
about the fact that we can derive
numbers from other numbers and not that
you know things cause other things so
yeah that's a really good point it seems
like that was an easy place to get
slipped up okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
