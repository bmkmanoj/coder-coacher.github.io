components of value proposition work
together with understanding the three
components of customer segments and in
value proposition the goal of this is to
find out the Minimum Viable Product and
in customer segments the goal is to
understand in detail the customer
archetype or persona and again this
equals product market fit I can't
emphasize enough that the business model
canvas is just a start it's great to
strategize and think about who customer
segments are and value proposition and
channel but remember all you're doing is
writing down hypotheses your job is to
turn those hypotheses into facts and
there are no facts inside your building
so your job is to get outside and test
them personally in a physical channel by
talking to hundreds of customers in a
web and mobile channel by talking to
thousands virtually and some portion
physically you need to watch people's
pupils dilate when they actually see and
like your product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
