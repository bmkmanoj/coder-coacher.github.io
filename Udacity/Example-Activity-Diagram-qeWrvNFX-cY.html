of it executing as follows imagine that
you had some token that you could lay on
top of any of the states in the diagram
it would come in with the start at the
top where there's the filled in circle
and it would move along the horizontal
line to get to the first state and then
it would move downward to the diamond at
which point you would split that is we'd
have two tokens one going over to the
right and one going downward the one on
the right can continue downward again
and finally coming into the diamond near
the bottom the second token from the top
goes straight downward and is thwarted
by the horizontal the heavy black
horizontal bar that's there this is a
synchronization point in this case
there's nothing to synchronize with but
there are two lines coming out of the
bottom those two lines will themselves
both have been a copy of the token on
them one will go over to the left into
the two activities that are there the
second will go straight downward and
eventually those two has will merge into
the second horizontal line which is a
synchronization point you can think of
those two paths each having their own
tokens as running independently and the
horizontal bar at the bottom being kind
of a gate which only opens when both
tokens have arrived from the top and
synchronizing those activities at the
point at which the gate opens the two
tokens are merged together a single
token goes out of the bottom into the
diamond and the diamond is essentially a
joint point which once again combines
the two tokens and proceeds on then to
the last state and the final state at
the very bottom of the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
