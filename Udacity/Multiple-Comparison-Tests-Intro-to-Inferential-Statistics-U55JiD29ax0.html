least two of the foods differ in terms
of mean amount consumed but we don't
know which ones differ we can see that
all three of the means differ from each
other but we don't know if these
differences are due to sampling error
therefore we need to do additional
testing to see which means are different
this additional testing is called
multiple comparison tests so we're able
to compare all of the means with each
other we wouldn't do a multiple
comparison test until after we've done
ANOVA one of the most common multiple
comparison tests is called Tukey's HSD
which stands for honestly significant
difference it's named after John Tukey a
very influential statistician Tukey's
HSD evaluates the significance of the
difference between any two group means
in statistics we say that this test will
allow us to make pairwise comparisons
the way we calculate Tukey's HSD is just
like the margin of error that you've
learned before remember that with a Z
test there was the Z critical value
denoted Z star times the standard error
and remember with a t-test it was the T
critical value times the standard error
but now when we're comparing three or
more samples we have a new statistic
called Q and we multiply this by the
square root of the mean square for
within subject variability divided by n
you might ask how is this similar to
these well the mean square for within
subject variability is the pooled
variance it's just the average squared
deviation of each value from its
respective group mean therefore the
square root is the pooled standard
deviation q is the studentized range
statistic and we find this in yet
another table its purpose is to adjust
the whole HSD so that it's less likely
we commit a type 1 error remember a type
1 error is when we reject the null
hypothesis when it's actually true since
Q increases when there are more groups
that we're comparing it makes it less
likely to commit
type 1 error remember that if a sample
mean was further away from the
population mean than the margin of error
it was considered unlikely well if two
sample means are further apart than the
Tukey's HSD then that's considered
honestly significantly different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
