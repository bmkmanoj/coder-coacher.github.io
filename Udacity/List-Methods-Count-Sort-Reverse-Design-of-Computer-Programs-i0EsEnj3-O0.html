methods that you may never have seen so
let's talk about count sort and reverse
so list dot count of X returns the
number of occurrences of X in the list
then here we've just called it list the
way you would use this is you would
write the name of your list here and
whatever element you want to count I
should mention that I've basically taken
this description straight from the
Python documentation list dot sort sorts
the list in place and I'll talk a little
bit more about what in place means later
and lists are Traverse does what you
would think it just reverses the
elements of the list and again it does
so in place now let's try using these
methods let's define a list of the
Udacity professors in this list I've
included all of the professors of the
six classes and you'll see that Dave's
name comes up twice this is because dave
teaches two of the classes also it makes
this problem a bit more interesting
let's say we want to know how many times
Steve's name shows up on this list for
this example it's pretty easy to count
ourselves but let's have Python do it
anyways we'll define a variable called
Steve count and set it equal to this
here the name of our list dot count and
I'm counting the occurrences of Steve if
I print Steve count I get one just as
I'd expect we could also count the
number of occurrences of Dave and when I
run this I get two as expected Dave and
Dave okay now let's see what happens
when we sort this list we'll define a
new variable called sorted profs and set
it equal to
Udacity profs dot sort when I print
sorted profs I get none wait what
happened here I would have expected a
sorted version of this list and this is
where that in place comes from that I
was talking about before methods that
work in place only modify the existing
list they modify Udacity profs they do
not create a new list in fact since
we've just sorted Udacity profs let's
see what happens when we print Udacity
profs and now you can see that they've
been sorted in alphabetical order isn't
mutability just wonderful
now poor wes is always at the end of
these sorted lists
let's give wes some love by reversing
this list
and just as we'd expect this is the same
list but sorted in reverse alphabetical
order there's plenty other Python list
methods and feel free to check out the
link below this video to see them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
