and create instances we don't know how
to do anything useful with them yet so
that's what we're going to learn next
we're going to learn about attributes if
we want to do something more interesting
with our classes we need to add
attributes to them and in Python we can
do that very simply we can use the
object followed by a dot followed by a
name this is the name of the attribute
and if we want to create a new attribute
or update an old one we can use
assignment so we can assign that to some
value what this does is it sets the
value associated with the attribute name
for the object here to be whatever this
expression evaluates to so let me show
you an example so here we've created an
instance of the restaurant class it has
no attributes yet but we can add one
using this syntax we're adding an
attribute name and giving it the value
of the string McDowell's Berger Emporium
and now we can use that attribute note
that adding an attribute doesn't create
a new object it just adds attributes to
that objects so we already had our
restaurant object that was created when
we did this we had a new instance of it
and we labeled it McDowell's now we've
taken that object and we've added an
attribute name to it and we've given it
some value notice that if we create a
new restaurant instance this is creating
a new object and we're assigning it to
the name shave and Hennis so the shea
bananas object does not have a name
attribute if we try to look for it we'll
get an error we get an attribute error
that says this restaurant object has no
attribute name name we can add one now
we've added a name attribute to Shea
bananas it's this long string that
didn't change the name of McDowell's
there's separate objects with separate
names we can of course add other
attributes so we can add say an owner
add another attribute and we'll also add
a chef's attribute these didn't change
anything about the object that chez
bananas points to just to confirm chez
bananas still has no chef just like any
other name we can change what a name
refers to so we can change what an
attribute refers to we'll do that just
with in assignments
suppose chef queasy was fired we have a
new chef in McDonald's we have chef hurl
and that'll change the value associated
with this name
now the chef's attribute points to the
string chef hurl sound very yummy to me
we can define functions that work on our
objects let's define a display
restaurant function and it's going to
take a restaurant as input and all it
will do is print the name of the
restaurant so let's try that
we'll call display restaurant passing in
the object Modell's refers to which has
the name McDowell's something or other
we can do the same thing with the object
Shea bananas refers to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
