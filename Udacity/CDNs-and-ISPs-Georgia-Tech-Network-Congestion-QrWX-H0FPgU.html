networks and ISPs have a fairly
symbiotic relationship when it comes to
peering relationships CD ends like to
peer with ISPs because peering directly
with ISPs where a customer is located
provides better throughput since there
are no intermediate a/s hops and network
latency is lower having more vectors to
deliver content increases reliability
and during large request events having
direct connectivity to multiple networks
where the content is hosted allows an
ISP to spread its traffic across
multiple transit links thereby
potentially reducing the 95th percentile
and lowering its transit costs on the
other hand there are other good reasons
for ISPs to peer with CDNs first of all
providing content closer to the ISPs
customers allows the ISP to provide the
customers with good performance for a
particular service for example you could
already see that Georgia Tech has placed
a Google cache node in its own network
resulting in very low latencies to
Google and thereby happy customers you
can imagine that providing good
performance to popular services is a
major selling point for ISPs another
reason that ISPs like to peer with CDNs
or host cache nodes locally is to lower
their transit costs you can imagine that
if there are a huge demand for a
particular video on YouTube and all of
the requests and responses were going
over expensive transit links then the
ISPs costs would be potentially
prohibitively high on the other hand
peering with the CDN or hosting a local
cache node prevents all of that traffic
from traversing expensive links thus
reducing costs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
