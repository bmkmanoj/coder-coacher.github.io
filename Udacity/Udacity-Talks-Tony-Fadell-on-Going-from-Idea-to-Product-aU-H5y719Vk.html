when having the idea in my mind what is
the best practice to to apply there the
end and implement it and execute you
just got a company right away do you
know as your parent when we did well
don't ask your parents your parents are
always gonna validate you that's a great
idea do never ask your parents it's a
good idea or not I have great parents
ask your spouse I'm great parents but
don't ask him because they're always
gonna say that's wonderful honey it's
great things they love you
unconditionally whether it's a good idea
or a bad idea they're gonna say it's
great you're seeing as spouses the
opposite spouse is the opposite should
be they should be truthful that's what
you want is a great partner so um no it
starts with an idea and in nest it took
almost a whole year before we started
the company the way that its first
started was how might I think I could
solve this problem technically so is it
do I have enough of the pieces do I know
enough of the things and I said yeah i
know that because i had enough
experience of that so he have first had
to research enough about what you think
would be building then after that you
started researching the market so you
have to remember when you're disrupting
an industry and if you have something
dramatically different if you have
disruptive technology then you can
change a stagnated market yes the way
that I've seen it is that you eat you
have to start with the idea what are you
changing and you have to take bold steps
in terms of making something and trying
it now you have to test lots of testing
so you would make something and then you
would go to a you know some of the
industry leaders or some of the people
you really trust who are knowledgeable
about a given area and you'd say what do
you think what do you think and then you
start to to set your risk level based on
how big the market is I think the way
the world changes is not by people being
safe but by challenging expectations
challenging the conventional wisdom and
if you want to change the world you need
to get out of the the the the area of
safeness
