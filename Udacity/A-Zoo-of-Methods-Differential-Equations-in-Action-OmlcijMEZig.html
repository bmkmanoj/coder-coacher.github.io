methods that we've seen so far and then
that's it one further method to that
collection the forward Euler method
worked by starting from the current
value and then incrementing that by the
step size H times the rate of change at
the current point i'm writing f4 the
rate of change here Hines method also
known as the improved or the modified
Euler's method advances by the time step
times the average of the rate of change
at the beginning plus the rate of change
at the position predicted by the forward
Euler method with a forward Euler method
the error of the numerical solution
grows linearly with step size if you
double the step size the global error
also doubles approximately at least the
forward Euler method is a method of
order one this function the hour grows
like H to the first power points method
however is the solver of order to the
error grows like H squared if we take
half the step size the error is
shrinking to one-quarter which is much
more efficient for the backward Euler
method be advanced by the rate of change
at the new position which makes this
equation difficult it's an implicit
equation to complete our zoo of methods
Viet a method that looks like Hans
method but is implicit like the beckford
Euler method this new rule is called the
trapezoidal rule like horns method is a
method of order 2 and if you compare
these equations they look pretty similar
the trapezoidal rule advances by the
average of the rate of change at the
beginning and the rate of change at the
end which means that this is an implicit
equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
