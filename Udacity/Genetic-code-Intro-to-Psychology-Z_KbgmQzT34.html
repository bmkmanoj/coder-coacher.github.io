need to understand a bit about how
genetic information is used to build
them so let's bring back Matt our
resident genetics expert so Matt how
does your body know how to build you
virtually every cell in your body
including your brain cells has all the
information necessary to build you
inside every cell resides the genetic
instructions or DNA that is arranged in
23 pairs of chromosomes wait so I know
that DNA is the blueprint for making a
living thing but what role did
chromosomes play ah chromosomes are
actually long strands of DNA wrapped
around proteins you've probably seen
pictures of them before it's how our
cells organize this information
structurally alright so that's cool but
how does it translate into Who I am or
who you are well DNA is made up of four
building blocks called nucleotides
adenine thymine guanine and cytosine we
usually refer to just the letters a T G
and C you have over three billion of
these letters in a unique sequence that
makes up who you are and your cells use
this as a set of instructions to create
you Wow
three billion sounds like a lot I wonder
how that compares to other living
organisms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
