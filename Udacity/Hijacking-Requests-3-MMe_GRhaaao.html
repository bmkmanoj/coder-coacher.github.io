should send back based on the request
URL but in the real world we need to be
more dynamic than that for example the
page can send a request which we
intercept and then send to the network
but rather than just sending the
response back we could look at it and do
something else for example let's respond
with a network fetch for the request
just as the browser would do if we left
it to its own devices the fetch method
will take a full request object as well
as a URL as we saw earlier fetch returns
a promise with promises you can attach a
dot then call back to get the result if
the operation was successful whatever we
return in this callback becomes the
eventual value for the promise this
means we can look at the response
ourselves and if the response is a 404
not found we could respond with our own
message otherwise we return the response
we received doc catch is similar to then
but dot then is for success and doc
catch is for failure fetch will fail if
it can't make a connection to the server
at all which includes offline so when
that happens we can respond with our own
message so now if we make sure a force
update is enabled and hit refresh
everything is back to normal but if we
go to a page that doesn't exist we get
our custom message if we take the server
down go offline and refresh the page we
get our custom message for that too we
can create complex rules for requests
trying to get a response from multiple
sources and reacting to the results and
we can do that on a request by request
basis using javascript you can even go
to the network and if that fails get
something else from the network in fact
this sounds like something for you to do
Mike come in Mike can you hear us yes I
can how about a task chaining to fetch
request together oh yeah let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
