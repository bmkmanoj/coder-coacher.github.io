that searches for long words and we know
that it should stop if you find one or
if you run out of words if I just worry
about running out of words at first I
might write my loop as while in dot has
next keep looking but now there's
another condition that i have to meet as
well i have to not have already found
the word so I want to keep looping as
long as there's another word and the
long word is not found now inside the
loop we need to actually get the next
word and then if this word we just got
is long then we want to save the word
for later and also make sure to mark
that we've found it so that we can exit
the loop so far I haven't created a
variable for saving this but if I scroll
down a little bit i can see that i want
to print out long word so let's make a
variable called long word now in my if
statement i'll update long word and set
found to true let's try this it says
that the first long word in Alice in
Wonderland is adventures that sounds
appropriate and I'd say that that's an
important word to alice in wonderland</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
