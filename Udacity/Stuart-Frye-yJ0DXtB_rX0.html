president of content here at Udacity
Stuart thank you so much for talking to
us today
absolutely so Stuart's gonna talk to us
a bit about the business side of
educational technology I know many
people are interested in seeing if they
can develop something they could spin
off into a startup ah so Stuart for any
of our students who are interested in
going into the startup world or in the
EdTech world the business side of things
what should they know about what it's
like to work in this space I think it's
you know it's one of the most
interesting and exciting places to start
a new business or launch an innovation
right now but it's also a very complex
place to think about as a market
education is one of the places where you
have multiple users and your end user is
not always the person who is making the
purchase decisions about the product so
if we think about the spectrum of
education from preschool up to higher ed
you have parents you have teachers you
have students you have administrators
and you did different products that are
being launched across k12 and higher ed
are targeted in some way at a mix of
those people and identifying who are
your end users who are your gatekeepers
and who are making the ultimate purchase
decisions can be one of the most complex
set of decisions you make about your
business model as well as the features
and functionality you're going to design
the product around yeah now I agree
completely I think that especially as an
educator myself I always think about the
student as my consumer but that's not
the person you end up selling to it's
person you ends up using your tool but
right and often times what they think
about your tool is not the ultimate
issue a learning can be frustrating yeah
it's the only domain I know of where
frustrating your end user can sometimes
actually be part of the goal yeah
absolutely so I know that some of our
students have project ideas already and
some of them are probably looking for
ideas they know they want to go into
this space but they don't know exactly
what to do so are there any open issues
open problems do you think that would be
worth tackling yeah I mean I think as
you as you think about problems to solve
in the education space I think your
solutions are gonna fall in a couple of
categories one is a Content category so
that's where Udacity plays right we are
creating content
that we're making available as part of
an online masters degree program or as
part of our nano degree programs in
addition to content there are tools so
tools either for students maybe it makes
students more productive a better way to
take notes develop projects tools for
teachers a better way to discover new
content track data analyze students and
I think between content and tools
anything about which area your solution
lies best in I also always encourage
entrepreneurs to think about a problem
you've faced immediately so if you
haven't spent any time in a classroom as
an educator you might think about
tackling a problem that students face
because you have spent time as a student
on the other hand David you spent a ton
of time as an educator and you probably
have a long list of problems that you'd
like solved so I would start there when
you think about coming up with a
solution or a business idea yeah make
sense I think that you're in some ways
when you're designing for yourself as a
customer it's a good place to start
although you never want to design your
entire project that way because you're
assigned something that's great for you
but doesn't work for anybody else right
and I think that emphasizes the
importance of user testing at the very
earliest stages I mean any any EdTech
idea that you have should start as
wireframes pencil sketches balsamiq
mockups
that you get out in front of people see
how they react test an idea very early
and often rather than to your point
designing an Indian solution that works
perfectly for you as an individual but
doesn't have product market fit more
broadly yeah absolutely so let's say
it's the end of the semester day after
the final project is due and now the
students are wondering what do I do next
what do you think the first step that
they should take when the semester is
over to maybe scale their project up
into a a business or a startup should be
Wow yes this this gets back to user
testing I would identify 20 people that
could be the end user of your product
and go out and get some version of it in
their hands and when I say a version of
it I do mean it could be a wireframe it
could be a mock-up it could be a
prototype in Photoshop or you could have
written some code and build out a very
simple working version but step one is
to
get it out in front of people because I
guarantee you your solution will change
and evolve over time and the more
quickly you can get input beyond your
own the better and finding those people
to test with isn't always easy but I
think within the context you have you
mean you're on a university or you're
surrounded by a community of students at
least you know virtually you can find a
lot of people quickly yeah I think that
because we're in this community and
because I think a lot of the projects
that our students develop will actually
be targeted at the LMS program because
it's what they experience and you've got
3,000 people sitting around experiencing
the same thing you're experiencing who
might be willing to test it out yeah
probably I can also share that um for
the NSF I core project which seeks to
turn academic research into real-world
businesses one of the first things I ask
all their participants to do is find a
hundred customers in one month and talk
to all of them for half an hour
Wow and they have to be paying customers
I don't think no not paying customers
you have a 100 potential customers okay
I'm for this it would be talked to a
hundred parents students teachers
principals get to the full range of
perspectives on that okay and yeah they
they really value that side of things as
well awesome so I'm doing anything last
to share with our students about working
in this field I think we often say that
there are two big fields that have yet
to been be disrupted by technology
education and health care
two pretty important ones right and I
would say that disruption is a word
that's often overused and misused but
when you boil down some of the key
tenants that clay Christensen talks
about when it comes to disruptive
technologies one of those tenants that I
personally find most exciting that thing
offers the most promise to powerful
solutions and education technology as
non-consumption if you think about the
fact that in the United States only one
in three adults has a four-year degree
and internationally only about 7% of
people end up with an advanced degree
the number of people that the things you
build could impact if you go over and
after those people who are least well
served by the existing system today the
non consumers of quality education today
people who can't benefit from the system
as it's built that's a huge number of
people
and it's a it's a massive impact so look
for those non-consumers look for those
opportunities to help people who aren't
being helped today and you'll build
great products that tons I was like part
of the foundation part of the philosophy
behind this program in general is
finding people who may not be you know
the underserved people in some of the
developed countries but are the people
who currently can't access quality
higher education based on Geographic or
you know family or economists yeah
exactly constraints yeah great thank you
so much for talking to us today
absolutely thanks for having me hope
anything I said is helpful and hope you
build amazing things good luck and
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
