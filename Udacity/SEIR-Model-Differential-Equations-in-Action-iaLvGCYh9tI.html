going to talk about a new version of the
SI R model one that includes births now
when we include births which means
births of non immunized or susceptible
children in immunological models new
effects appear here we're going to try
that out using the sei armed model you
might remember this from our earlier
unit this is just the SAR model with an
added stage of being exposed to the
disease but not yet infectious in other
words a person is in the e category here
is infected but can't yet spread the
disease to other people now we've
introduced a birth rate which means
adding people into the susceptible pot
and a mortality rate all compartments
sei and R have the same mortality rate
however so this means that the disease
isn't life-threatening since people
across the board regardless of whether
or not they're infected die at the same
rate this is a model that does have
immunity
that means we don't have a cycle as we
did in some of our other examples
instead we just have a straight shot
from s to e to I to R now as you did
before we'll call our total population n
but in this case n is not a constant
rather n as a function of time it's
still equal to the sum of sei and R but
the sum is going to change over time
now since n is not a constant need to
make sure that we compute the number of
infections per day correctly it isn't
just going to be some constant times I
times s anymore let's build up the
equation together so we're going to
start with the number of times any
person comes into contact with any other
people per day so that's just equal to
contacts per day then in order to get
the number of contacts per day of a
person with susceptible people not just
any people we modify this by multiplying
by a factor of s over n so this is just
the fraction of the total population
that is susceptible and of course this
is a function of time as well then if we
want to change this expression to equal
the number of infections spread by each
infectious person per day then you
multiply all of this by the transmission
probability now lastly to get the total
number of infections per day we multiply
this by I the number of infectious
people now what we
you to do in the code is to implement
the sei our model using the forward
Euler method as always we've given you
the important constants that you'll need
to use including the birth rate and the
mortality rate and of course a set of
initial values as well and down here in
the for loop we've included the standard
equations for the sei arm model but we
haven't taken into account births and
deaths yet so that's your job
good luck on the first problem of your
final</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
