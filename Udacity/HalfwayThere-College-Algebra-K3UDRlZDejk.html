coordinates at that point are 100 + 350
when I figured this out the first time I
basically eyeballed where I thought
halfway along the line was and then
figure out the coordinates at that point
but is there a way that we can use the
coordinates of the two points on the
line that we already know to find the
coordinates of the point halfway between
them in fact there is we know that home
is located at 0 0 the origin and Udacity
is located at 200 700 going halfway
between these points means going both
halfway in the X direction and halfway
in the Y direction so let's look at
those coordinates individually for the x
coordinate we start at zero and we want
to go halfway to 200 half of the
distance between 0 and 200 is 100 so we
just go over that much that
automatically gives us our x-coordinate
the y-coordinate works in pretty much
the same way our initial y coordinate of
home is 0 we want to go up 702 where
Udacity is located vertically this
distance is 700 miles so have a 700 is
350</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
