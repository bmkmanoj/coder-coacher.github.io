data between training and testing sets
in this class so far what I want to do
now is show you how you can actually do
this very simply using some tools in SK
learn of course you don't need SK learn
to do this you just need to be able to
split up your data but SK learn has some
functions that turn this really into a
one or two line of code type problem if
we want to do a training testing split
in SK learn we want to look for a group
of functions that fall under the general
title of cross-validation in this
documentation page they have a little
bit of a warm up the idea of
cross-validation why you might do it but
these are things that you're already
familiar with because we've talked about
them a lot in this class what I want to
do is skip ahead to this code example
right here and show you how this can
actually be deployed in code the output
of this is going to be four sets of data
the first two are going to be the
features for the training and for the
testing data the second two are going to
be the labels for the training and the
testing data set in this example there's
a couple lines here probing how many
events fall into each of these two data
sets the training in the testing and
then down here you can see that there's
actually an SVM that's now being trained
on the training data the features and
the labels or as they call it X train
and Y train and then we can do an
evaluation on the test set so this is
looking at something called the score of
the classifier this is sort of related
to the accuracy so this is something
that you want to be evaluating on your
test data now one of the things that
maybe you noticed on some of the mini
projects if you were paying very close
attention is that we've actually been
deploying this code all along so in all
of the for example classifier training
exercises that you did there was a line
of code that was very similar to this
one where I was splitting the data into
a training and testing split for you so
now what I'm going to ask you to do is
in the form of a programming quiz I'm
going to ask you to actually deploy a
line of code like this on your own so
you have some practice doing it I'll
give you a data set that's being read in
with all of the features and all of the
labels and what I want you to do is to
insert a line of code here that splits
it into the training and the testing
sets then I'll take those training and
testing sets and train and make
predictions using a classifier so your
job is just to practice deploying a line
of code like this one the Train test
split
in SK learn so that code will execute
correctly so give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
