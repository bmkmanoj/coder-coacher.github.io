about the rational unified process and
you know that I'd like to provide a
historical perspective for the topics
that we cover in class and this lesson
is no exception
so let's see a little bit of history or
RUP to do that we have to go back to
1997 when rational defined six backs
practices for modern software
engineering so let's look at what these
practices were the first practice
involved developing in an iterative way
with risk as the primary iteration
driver the second practice had to do
with managing requirements including
updating them and keeping traceability
information between requirements and
other software artifacts practice number
three was to employ a component based
architecture what that means that is to
have a high level design that focuses on
cooperating components that are
nevertheless very cohesive and highly
decoupled modeling software visually is
another key aspect of the rational
unified process and the key concept here
is to use visual diagrams and in
particular UML visual diagrams in a very
extensive way so as to make artifacts
easier to understand and agree upon
among stakeholders and the fact that the
process is defined in an iterative way
allows for performing Quality Assurance
activities in a continuous way so it
allows for continuously very fine
quality throughout the development
process finally change management and
control were also at the center of the
rational approach this six practices
that I just mentioned where the starting
point for the development of the
rational unified process which is what
we're going to discuss next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
