mean disturbance of thought emotion or
behavior that is things are not going
well and how a person thinks feels or
behaves second we have dysfunction and
here we mean dysfunction of biological
or developmental processes dysfunctional
behavior interferes with everyday
functioning and could lead a person to
being at risk or the person is risking
the safety of others dysfunction can
mean the inability for a person to hold
down a job or engage in meaningful
social relationships with close friends
or loved ones the third we have distress
or disability and here we mean distress
or disability in everyday life
especially relationships work or other
activities here the behavior leads to
real discomfort or anguish either in the
person directly or in others the
distressing element is one reason we may
say a person is suffering from a
disorder it can cause pain to a person
and/or other people especially family
members and this is an important point
to bring up and something that we
discussed throughout the class that it's
not only the person with a disorder that
experience is a difficulty pain anxiety
or sadness it's also the person's loved
ones who can experience difficulty as
well that is it can be painful and sad
to watch a loved one suffer through some
of the symptoms of mental illness
remember in the lesson on memory when we
talked about HM and people with amnesia
or dementia and how we talked about how
difficult it could be if you were the
husband or wife mother father brother or
sister of the person who was unable to
remember you obviously it'd be really
painful to deal with and now finally for
the last D we have deviant by this we
mean deviant thought emotion or behavior
but only if it's also dysfunctional
deviance alone is not enough deviant
literally means different from the norm
or different from what most people do
the dsm-5 does stress that deviant
behavior can be classified as a disorder
only if it's also dysfunctional
I'm Stein for example was deviant in
many ways but he wasn't dysfunction
