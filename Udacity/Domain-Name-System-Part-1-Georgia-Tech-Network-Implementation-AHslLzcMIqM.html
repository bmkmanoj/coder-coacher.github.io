system or DNS the purpose of the domain
name system is to map human readable
names such as wwg edu to IP addresses
such as 130 dot 207 dot one sixty dot
173 a name such as this is human
readable and much easier to remember and
type than an IP address but in fact the
IP address is what's needed to send
traffic to the intended destination so
we need a lookup mechanism that takes a
human readable name and maps it to an IP
address the system that does this is a
domain name system or the DNS the system
roughly works as follows a client might
want to look up a domain name such as
wwg a edu and networked applications
source code might do so by invoking a
function such as get hosts by name which
takes as an argument a domain name and
returns an IP address the client
typically has what's called a stub
resolver and that stub resolver takes
that name and issues a query the stub
resolver might have cached the answer or
the IP address corresponding to this
name but if not the query is sent to
what's called a local DNS resolver your
local DNS resolver is typically
configured automatically when your host
is assigned an IP address using a
protocol called the domain host
configuration protocol or DHCP and your
host configuration such as this one you
can see that this local host has two
local DNS resolvers typically a client
will try the first DNS resolver and if
it doesn't receive a response within a
pre-configured timeout it will try
sending the same query to the second
local DNS resolver as a backup this
query is typically issued recursively
meaning the client does not want
intermediate referrals sent back to it
it only wants to hear when it's received
the final answer the local resolver on
the other hand will perform iterative
queries it might have the answer to this
particular query in the cache in which
case it would simply reply with the
answer but let's suppose for the moment
that nothing is cached each fully
qualified domain name is presumed to end
with a dot indicating the root of the
DNS hierarchy
now the IP addresses for the root
servers or those that are authoritative
for the root may already be configured
in the local DNS resolver in this case
the resolver may be able to query for
the authoritative server for edu and say
a root servers net this would be an a
record query but the answer might return
with what's called an NS record which is
a referral in this case the answer might
be a referral to the edu servers now the
local resolver issues the same query to
the edu servers and receives a referral
to the authoritative servers for got a
CD you finally the local resolver might
query the authoritative name server for
got a CDU and actually receive an a
record indicating the actual IP address
that corresponds to that name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
