processes is basically kind of start
looking at scales at different octaves
and this was one of the reasons we
looked at the whole concept of doing
this kind of analysis at DIF pyramid
levels because each one of them is a
different octave and now we can actually
start modeling the signal and now we can
actually start doing all of the
processing and one of course comes out
as the different scales we can actually
have these gaussians and stuff like that
and using these gaussians we can also
start looking at differences of
gaussians again very similar concept to
what we're done when we did some of the
blending using the frequency domain
basically look at these types of things
you can see is then we now actually can
do the pyramids and start looking at
information at different scales this
basically shows us how we can actually
do the difference of gaussians that I
was showing you before between different
scales and using that we can find the
extrema points which are all these
examples here of course what we want to
do now is find a few specific extrema
points so of course we would now kind of
find all the points that have high
contrast and it starts giving me more
features there's a lot more features
here and of course now I've started
reducing them and then I get rid of all
of the there are not edges just the
corner features and I get even less
number of points and this starts kind of
start giving me the features that I want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
