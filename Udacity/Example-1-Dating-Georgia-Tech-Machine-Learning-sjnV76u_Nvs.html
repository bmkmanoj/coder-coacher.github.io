know what it takes to do at least
supervised learning and so now I want to
do a specific algorithm and a specific
representation that allows us to solve
the problem of going from instances to
actual concepts so what we're going to
talk about next are decision trees and I
think the best way to introduce decision
trees is through an example so here's
the very simple example I want you to
think about for a while you're on a date
with someone and you come to a
restaurant and you're going to try to
decide whether to enter the restaurant
or not so your input your instances are
going to be features about the
restaurant and we'll talk a little bit
about what those features might be and
the output is whether you should enter
or not ok so it's a very simple
straightforward problem but there are a
lot of details here that we have to
figure it's a classification problem
it's clearly a classification problem
because the output is yes we should
enter or no we should move on to the
next restaurant so in fact it's not just
a classification problem
it's those binary classification
problems that I said that we'd almost
exclusively be thinking about for the
next few minutes ok so you understand
the problem setup yes though I'm not
sure exactly what the pieces of the
input are right so that's actually the
right next question asked we have to
actually be specific now about a
representation before I was drawing
squiggly little lines and you can
imagine what they were but now since
we're really going to go through an
example we need to be clear about what
does it mean to be standing in front of
a restaurant so let's try to figure out
how we would represent that and how we
would define that we're talking about
you're standing in front of a restaurant
or eatery because I can't seem to
reliably spell restaurant and we're
going to try to figure out whether we're
going to go in or not but what do we
have to describe our eatery what do we
have what are our attributes what are
the instances actually made of so what
and or another way of putting it is what
are the features that we need to pay
attention to that are going to help us
to determine whether we should yes enter
into the restaurant or no move on to the
next restaurant so any ideas Michael
sure I guess there's like the type of
restaurant okay so he's a tall
short and is it a good credit risk oh
wait no no wait no I know like like you
know Italian versus French versus you
know Vietnamese so let's call that the
type so I could be Italian you be French
I could beat I could be American they're
American restaurants right so we're
Greek it can be Armenian it can be any
kind of restaurant you want to okay good
so that's something that probably
matters because maybe you don't like
Italian food or maybe you really are in
the mood for Thai sounds perfect okay
anything else sure
how about whether it smells good you
know I like cleanliness what's the let's
or you know what let's let's be nice to
our eateries and let's say atmosphere
mmm right because if there's you know no
atmosphere then it's going to be really
hard to breathe that's exactly right
so is it fancy is it a hole in the wall
I'm going to go hiw is it a hole in the
wall those sorts of things you know
casual I guess is another category
casual and so on and so forth you can
imagine lots of things like that but
these things might matter to you and
your date okay so we know the type of
restaurant that we have we know whether
it's fancy whether it's casual whether
it's a hole in the wall some of the best
food I've ever had or and you know well
known hole in the walls those sorts of
things anything else we get the girls
sure sometimes I might use something
like looking inside and seeing whether
there's people in there whether they
look like they're having a good time
right so that's an important thing so
let's just say if it's occupied now why
might that matter in reality well it
matters because if it's completely full
and you may have to wait for a very long
time you might not want to go in on the
other hand if you're looking at a
restaurant you've never heard of and
there's only two people in it and it's
Friday at 7 p.m. maybe that says
something about something so maybe you
wanted to be quiet you know those sorts
of things might matter okay so we've got
type
we've got atmosphere we've got occupied
anything else you can think of Shh I
have been out of the dating market for a
while but I guess it could imagine I
could imagine how hard I'm trying to
work to impress my date
perfect so do you have a hot date or not
or this is someone you really really
really want to impress and so maybe it
matters then it's even more important
whether it's a fancy restaurant or hole
in the wall or whether it's French or
whether it's an American restaurant that
makes sense
and that makes sense notice by the way
that the first two sets that we have
have multiple possible categories here
so they can be Italian French Thai
American so on and so forth
atmosphere is something that can have
many many possible values but the last
two things that we talked about we're
all binary either it's occupied or it's
not yes or no or you have a hot date or
you don't and I think we could go on
like this for a long time but let's try
to move on to maybe a couple of other
features and then try to actually figure
out we might solve this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
