be concerned about is all the tracking
that happens when you visit websites and
they know where are we going so if you
go to the website of course they would
know that you're accessing that website
but what about others so you'll be
surprised how many other websites are
able to figure out that you visit for
example newyorktimes.com these are tens
of them I think at one point I read like
50 other side's learn about the fact
that you are visiting New York Times
calm these third parties are able to do
it because they either advertisements
embedded in the New York Times phase
that you get back or they're the likes
the facebook twitter and whatever other
things that and some of these things we
may not even see or pay attention to but
essentially we pull some bit of the
content that makes up the page from all
these websites that allow them to track
the fact that we are visiting New York
Times so you can do what is called
third-party cookie blocking so browsers
actually allows you to do a variety of
things you can block cookies if you
block cookies altogether then maybe you
can't do anything useful with New York
Times com either the third party cookies
course blocking up protects you the
blocking third party cookies of course
protects you you can tell your browser
that you don't like to be tracked and in
this case the browser when its sense of
information to a website would actually
tell the website that the user doesn't
want to be tracked whether the website
owners that are not is a different
question cookies that are kept on your
computer to track you know your history
and so on we can clear those and when
the next time you visit that website the
website won't have this knowledge that
of what you had done previously you can
block for pups you can there other
private browsing sort of things that you
can do browser modes that and clear out
any state that may be built while you're
using a tab incognito mode or they're
even more sort of aggressive privacy
things that you can do with your
browsers so the idea is that you know
tracking is progressive there's some
things we can do about it we don't know
how effective those things are but at
least you know the things that you can
do by
going into your privacy setting of your
browser that you use and they're
slightly different across the from the
browser so I'm not talking a great deal
about how exactly you do but I would
HIGHLY encourage you to explore these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
