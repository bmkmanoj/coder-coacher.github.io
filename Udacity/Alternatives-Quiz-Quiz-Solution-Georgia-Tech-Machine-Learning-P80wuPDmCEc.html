have a bunch well soul a big advantage
of ice here RCA it's cheap it is cheap
it's simple it is simple it's easy it is
easy let's sort of comical or complexity
sounds sort of practically free those
are all words like free easy those are
those the words that came to mind your
saying that that's none of those as your
word no none of those was the word that
I'm worse no it did start with the
letter F though famous know foul-mouthed
that's two words friendly no all right I
need more than letters I'm still going
back to famous fabulous fast that's
right it's fast but i would give you
definitely give you cheaper easy cheap
is like fast so is easy all right please
do that's what the slang term meant
where I grew up anyway okay so anything
that captures fast cheap easy whatever
would do here but what's irritating
about this and actually things like
k-means and K&amp;amp;N and a whole bunch of
other algorithms is that they're so
freakin simple and yet they managed to
work and that's can be kind of annoying
sometimes because you know as machine
learning people we want to come up with
these complex things at work but as a
very brilliant man what's said to me you
must earn your complexity so our see a
randomized component analysis or really
randomized projections has this very
simple way of thinking about the world
I'll just randomly throw things together
and it turns out to pick up correlations
along the way and work pretty well and
it's big advantage other than working
sometimes is that it's very very fast
PCA can take hours and supercomputers
and I CA can take hours upon hours and
even more supercomputers but generating
a bunch of random numbers computers are
really good at that and it happens to go
really really fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
