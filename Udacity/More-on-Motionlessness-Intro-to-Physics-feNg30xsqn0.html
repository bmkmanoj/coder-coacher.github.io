stick with me for a little bit longer
we've got one more thing to talk about
with motionlessness which is actually
surprisingly fascinating I want to point
out one thing from before an object
that's motionless tour at rest well from
a force point of view it's in the exact
same situation as an object moving at
constant speed so from here on out
whenever I talk about an object that's
at rest we could also be talking about
an object that's a constant speed it's
just a little easier to visualize an
object that's not moving and the key to
motionless is realizing that when an
object is at rest its acceleration is 0
F equals MA tells us that zero
acceleration means zero total force zero
total force doesn't necessarily mean
that there's no force acting on an
object at all all it means is that any
upwards forces must be balanced by
corresponding downwards forces likewise
leftwards forces must be balanced by
right words forces let's take a look at
I you shun Brent who are each pushing on
this cart this car has mass m and we'll
say that the mass is five kilograms and
right now the cart is exactly at rest
they're both pushing very hard but the
car is at rest I should mention that
most of these questions we do we're
going to ignore something called
friction friction is the force you feel
between your hands when you rub them
together it's a real force and it's
something we can talk about but to make
matters simpler will often ignore it so
this is a frictionless world for now so
let's go ahead and take a look at all
before TSA's acting on this card I'm
going to draw a force diagram well the
first force I'm going to draw is mg and
in this case mg is going to equal this
five kilograms times G and we know G is
10 meters per second squared which gives
me a total of 50 Newtons and Newton's
are the unit of force the ground must
also be pushing upwards with a normal
force I you she's doing his best and
he's pushing to the right we'll label
that FA fri you sh and bren is also
doing his best and pushing back to the
left well label that FB notice how I've
drawn these arrows you know I Uche is
pushing from the left to the right I
don't draw an arrow like this for me
it's much easier to see what's going on
if the arrow is coming from the object
and moving out so we know that the card
is at rest and I've given you a couple
of the forces I've told you that mg is
50 Newtons and I've told you that I
yoosh is pushing with a force of 100
Newtons can you use this data as well as
what we learned up here to fill in these
two answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
