formal grammars we're going to need to
use them to understand or describe HTML
and JavaScript we are going to design
together formal grammars that exactly
capture HTML and JavaScript or at least
interesting subsets of them if we were
trying to understand English sentences
there's a special kind of diagram we
could make here I have a very high-level
partial grammar for English sentence has
a noun phrase a verb phrase and an
object a noun phrase is just decorated
now like maybe a noun with an adjective
in front of it a verb phrase is a
decorated verb may be a verb with an
adverb in front of it and then the
object could be a noun phrase or a noun
or something more complicated so for
example here's a sentence Wes reads
Romance of the Three Kingdoms now there
are various different ways to diagram
English sentences and we'll do something
relatively simple we just want to
indicate which part matches which
grammatical form so our noun phrase is
going to be Wes our verb phrase is reads
and the object is Romance of the Three
Kingdoms we could divide it up so that
the object falls under the verb phrase
or that we draw these slightly
differently but mostly we want to know
which part goes where who's doing the
reading is it Wes or the book this sort
of diagram will help us figure that out
and in fact in formal languages or with
a grammar like this there's a more
common way a more pictorial way of
representing these sentences we can draw
something that looks a bit like an
inverted tree I'm going to take each one
of these production rules and put its
left-hand side at the top and then give
it children or branches based on which
rule is chosen and what's available on
the right so here we have a sort of a
pyramid like shape or what's officially
called a parse tree
remember that syntactic analysis is
sometimes called parsing this might not
look like a tree but what you want to do
is imagine the tree growing upside down
so here's our tree and at various places
although it's starting with sort of the
trunk or
it branches out and all of these
intermediate parts in the tree represent
non terminals in the grammar and all of
the leaves right at the end represent
terminals or tokens in the final
sentence or utterance this is called a
parse tree by long-standing tradition we
draw them upside down starting at the
root with the start non-terminal oh and
while we're here you too should consider
reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms
written in the 14th century it's a
Chinese historical novel about the end
of the Han Dynasty good stuff so here's
one of our favorite grammars from before
a simple arithmetic expression grammar
and let's say that our input is 1 plus 2
plus 3 here is a possible parse tree we
start at the top at the root with our
non-terminal expression and then each
time we have a number of children equal
to the number of symbols to the right of
the arrow so from using expression goes
to expression plus expression I have one
node with 3 children I need to get 1
plus 2 plus 3 so I'm going to need to
use this first rule at least twice once
to get this plus sign and wants to get
that one so here I'm using it once one
instance of rule 1 and here I'm using it
twice another instance of rule 1 you'll
note that they overlap the first time we
use this rule we started drawing this
part of the tree this expression node
was the result the second time it was
the thing we were choosing to expand
this is normal this represents the
recursive structure of a grammar in a
parse tree like this these parts at the
end that have no children are called
leaves when the parts in the middle are
called nodes sometimes the leaves are
called leaf nodes which is a bit
ambiguous these are always going to be
terminals intermediate nodes are always
going to be non terminals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
