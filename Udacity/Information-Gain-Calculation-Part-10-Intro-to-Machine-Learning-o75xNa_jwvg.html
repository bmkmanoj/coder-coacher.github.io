speed limit we get perfect purity of the
branches that we make as a result so our
information gain is going to be equal to
one we started out with an entropy of
one at the end we had an entropy is zero
so the information gained is going to be
one this is the best information gain
that we can have definitely this is
where we want to make a split and just
to sketch out the decision tree it would
look something like this where when we
look at samples where the speed limit is
in effect so these first two rows where
the answer for speed limit is yes then
we get all of our slow examples over
there on the other side when there's no
speed limit everything is going to be
fast so this has just been a very simple
calculation it still took us a while to
get through but I hope you have a little
bit of a better sense for what
information gain is in decision trees
and why it's so important so it's
calculations like this that the decision
tree is figuring out when it does the
training it looks at all of the training
examples all of the different features
that are available to it and it uses
this information gain criterion in
deciding which variables to split on and
how to make the splits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
