negative 4 squared well negative 4
squared since the negative is not inside
any parentheses means it's not part of
the base so this is going to be negative
1 times 4 squared and then we have
negative 14 squared i know is 4 times 4
4 times 4 is 16 so i have negative 1
times 16 gives me negative 16 okay let's
try number two this time I have the
negative inside the parentheses so that
means my base is negative 3 so this
one's going to be negative 3 squared
which is negative 3 times negative 3 and
we know negative 3 times negative 3
gives us a positive 9 now the first two
problems had even exponents let's try
these two with odd exponents the first
problem i have negative 2 cubed which
means negative 1 times 2 cubed negative
1 times 2 cubed is negative 1 times 2
times 2 times 2 and two times two times
two is eight so i have negative 1 times
8 which is going to give me negative 8
okay number for this time like in number
two I have the negative 3 in parentheses
which means it's part of our base so
negative 3 cubed is just negative 3
times negative 3 times negative 3
negative 3 times negative 3 is positive
9 positive 9 times negative 3 is
negative 27 if I look at number two and
number four I have a negative number as
the base and number two if you notice
the exponent here is even when we raise
a negative number to an even power the
answer is going to be positive and
number four we have a negative number
being raised to an odd power whenever we
raise negative numbers to an odd power
the answer is going to be negative it's
something you can keep in mind for
number five notice we have a negative
exponent we know if we have a negative
exponent we have to take the reciprocal
of the base so 5 to the negative 2 is 5
over 1 to the negative 2 because we can
rewrite 5 as 5 over 1 and when we take
the reciprocal that's going to be one
fifth and we get rid of the negative
once we take the
reciprocal of the base notice once I
take the reciprocal I get rid of the
negative exponent so we have one fifth
squared which is one-fifth x 1 5th and
that's going to be 1 times 1 is 1 and 5
times 5 is 25 so 5 to the negative 2 is
1 over 25 think about how you did how
many did you get right and wrong decide
if you need to go back and review the
material again before moving on to the
next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
