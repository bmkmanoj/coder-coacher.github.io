professor at Georgia Tech and I'm the
instructor for this course hi I'm Dave
Priya Dawei a graduate student at
Georgia Tech you can call me Dave my
original research was about machine
learning for robotics but in 2007 I
became interested in using these same
algorithms for investing since that time
I've shifted my research and teaching
towards finance I also co-founded a
financial technology company called
Lucena research I'm a graduate student
who's been working with Professor to
build a predictive system for stock
market I'm also working on the software
to support this course you're going to
see a lot of Dave in this course she
makes a lot of things happen behind the
scenes now Dave I'm thinking about
buying Apple stock do you think I should
do it mmm well it depends on a lot of
factors what are the other stocks in
your portfolio what do you think will
predict stock prices also how much risk
do you think you can take it on so those
are all good questions and Dave is
exactly right we need to consider all of
those things before we make an
investment now in this course we're
going to cover a lot of these issues
we're going to show you how information
influences the movement of a stock price
how to build software to analyze and
visualize these relationships and
details about how the stock exchanges
work finally in the last section of this
course we're going to show you how to
build machine learning algorithms that
you can use to build real trading
strategies now let's get started let's
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
