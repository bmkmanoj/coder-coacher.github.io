raised with the string try again this is
not an exception though it won't raise
that error but it will raise an
exception because this is invalid code
any invalid code raises some kind of
exception and what this raises is a type
error which gets handled by this handler
which raises a 0 division error with the
string razor ruckus which then gets
handled by the outer try by this handler
which prints out that string for the
second one well this is an exception so
the Rays could work with just that but
we're adding 3 to it exceptions don't
have a plus operation so that's going to
produce a type error which will get
handled here that's going to raise 0
division error which is also going to
print razor records that's distinct from
the third example where we're going to
print raise now we're going to call
raised with IO error passing an a so
that's a valid raise it's going to raise
the i/o error exception that's not a
type error so it won't be handled by
this exception handler but it is an
exception so it will be handled by this
one which raises a typeerror which is
the value of the string associated with
that exception which is a and ruckus and
that gets handled by this handler which
prints out a ruckus and we already print
out the race here so this one also
prints out razor ruckus part of what
this example illustrates is how
convoluted exceptions can make your code
so please please please don't ever
actually write code like this unless
you're trying to confuse someone and
usually when you're writing code you
shouldn't be trying to confuse people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
