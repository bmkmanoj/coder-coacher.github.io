program States each program States
consists of several variables with
values as a program executes it
processes these states and transforms
them into new states for instance by
reading variables and writing variables
this is the normal mode of operation now
however since in the beginning we have a
normal input and in the end we have a
failure there must be a defect somewhere
in our program that actually causes the
problem so let me assume that this
statement we're executing here actually
has a defect what happens is that now
when executed it introduces an error in
the program state which we call an
infection this infection is now being
propagated possibly to other state and
eventually becomes visible as a failure
towards the user what we get in here is
actually an entire cause-effect chain
you see these failures which is an
infection is caused by earlier
infections which again is caused by
earlier infection and if we are at a
state where the infection has no further
origin that is the input estate is sane
and the output is infected then we know
a statement that was executed at this
precise moment which caused this
transition from st. state to infected
state this is the statement which caused
the infection this is the statement
which has the defect when we are
debugging now we need to identify this
cause-effect chain but only d would we
need to identify it but we also need to
break the cause-effect chain if we can
break this cause-effect chain from
defect to failure then we're done with
debugging so all of this looks very
simple however in real life it's much
more complicated than that to start with
not every defect automatically cause as
a failure it may well be that the defect
causes an infection which later simply
is not propagated as a real-life
infection just as well so the infection
is a propagated and never ever becomes
visible to the user it may not even
cause a failure at all or the statement
with the defect may not even be executed
or only under very specific
circumstances made actually cause an
infection
and later a failure this is the problem
of testing you can execute a program
again and again never have a failure and
still have a defect in there however if
a program fails that is if we actually
see a failure then we can always trace
it back to the defect that causes it so
if there's a failure we can always fix
it by following back the cause-effect
chain but then the next problem is these
states are huge so over here we have 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 12 variables cute in reality
we have ten thousands of such variables
and not only do we have ten thousands of
such variables we also have ten
thousands of steps between defect and
failure so tracing back the cause-effect
chain can be much much more complicated
than it is in this simple picture the
longer the cause-effect chain that is
the longer the time we have to cover the
more states we have to cover the harder
is to debug it and also the larger the
state the more we have to search for an
infection again this makes debugging
harder and harder it's like finding a
needle in a haystack except that the
haystack sometimes is larger than any
haystack you ever find on earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
