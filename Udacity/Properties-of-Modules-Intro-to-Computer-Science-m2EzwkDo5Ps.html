tricky to answer based on just what I've
told you so far and the picture might be
a little deceptive but I hope you've
thought about this from the perspective
of constructing a program the answer
that I think is correct is that it's not
the case that all modules should be of
similar size it's okay if they are like
shown in the picture but this shouldn't
be a big design constraint it's okay if
the size is very and in a typical
program will have some small modules in
some larger ones the second answer is
true our goal in using modularity is
manage complexity so we want to break
the program in the pieces small enough
that one partner can understand and
build them note that if we're dealing
with a very large program this may
require hierarchy we might need modules
of modules the third answer is incorrect
if there are no dependencies at all
between the modules well that means
they're not working together in order
for the modules to work together there
has to be some connections between them
what we want is for those dependencies
to be manageable we want there to be
small well-defined interfaces between
the modules that means that in order to
use one module what we need to
understand about that module is as
little as possible but enough to be able
to use it to build something useful and
that's going to be one of the main
things we focus on in this lesson one of
the advantages of having narrow
well-defined interfaces is we can
separate the implementation from the use
of the module that if we have some other
way of implementing this piece well we
could still plug it in and we wouldn't
need to change the Greenpeace at all
that's one of our goals of modular
design to be able to plug in different
modules without having to reconsider the
whole system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
