basically you know memcached gets the
hash table and dictionaries in Python
our hash tables as well the semantics
line up really nicely so all these
functions are very simple set cache key
to value no problem return true to get
we actually can use the get function
that's built in the Python dictionaries
which is basically says get key and if
the key is not there it will return none
if we had typed something like this this
would raise an exception if if the key
isn't in the cache Python would complain
and the get function is used to avoid
that problem deleting a key in the cash
so first of all we do is you say if the
key is in the cache then delete it and
this is the Python syntax for deleting
something from a dictionary another way
of doing this would be to use the pop
function which is built in the Python
and what base basically this says is
find the key in the dictionary and if
it's there return it otherwise return
false and if you don't have this false
this will raise an exception I find this
approach to be a little bit more
readable however so which is why I did
it that way and of course flushing the
cash is easy you just call clear on the
dictionary and let's give all these a
run real quick to see if they work I'm
going to go down to my test a little
test harness here and uncomment all
these operations and then we'll give
this a run and we can see that things
work we set X 21 and we get back true
which is what we expected we get X and
we can see the value is 1 we get why the
value is none because Y is not in the
cache and then we delete X and then try
to get it and we see that X is now none
ok so our basic cash is working good job
on that and let's move on to some more
advanced memcached</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
