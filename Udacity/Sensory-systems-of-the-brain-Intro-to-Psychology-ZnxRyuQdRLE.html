with a specific sensory cortex is the
visual cortex which is located in the
occipital lobes the second is the
auditory cortex which is located in the
temporal lobes and the third is the
somatosensory cortex which is
responsible for touch and is located in
the parietal lobes our sense of smell
and taste don't have their own
processing region however it's
interesting to note that smell can bring
forth very strong and immediate memory
have you for example notice that
particular smells can bring back a
memory for you I can think of a few
myself for example the smell of homemade
pizza reminds me of my grandmother the
smell of the beach reminds me of this
summer's my family and I spin on the
beach or for example maybe the smell of
a perfume or cologne reminds you of an
ex-lover you once have that's just an
example of how smells can evoke powerful
memories stop and think for a minute if
you recall any particular smells that
bring back a memory to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
