professor of computer science at Georgia
Tech and also a member of the Georgia
Tech Institute for information security
and privacy I've been at Georgia Tech
for thirty years and it's been a great
journey my research interests are in
computer systems and system security in
addition to doing research and teaching
I served as director of the Georgia Tech
Information Security Center from 2004 to
2012 I also co-founded pin-drop security
that is commercializing our research
that we did here in telephony security
I'll be co-teaching this course with
Professor Wang Kili
both of us have taught this course on
our campus many times we're delighted to
bring this course to all of you in this
new format the course introduction
information security provides a broad
overview of the field of cyber security
unlike our adversaries who just have to
find one way to compromise our systems
we have to secure every aspect of these
systems I'll be starting with topics
like software security operating system
security database security and so on
once I'm done with part one we're going
to move on to part two with Professor
Ann Kelly hello my name is Venki Lee I'm
a professor of computer science at
Georgia Tech I'm also the co-director of
the Georgia Tech Institute for

research interests are in systems and
network security applied cryptography
and data mining
I've also Co found a company called
Ambala it commercializes our research in
bandit detection I'll be covering the
second half of this course the topics
will include cryptography security
protocols network defenses malware web
security and mobile security was talk
I'm really excited about bringing this
course to students absolutely and by the
time we are done hopefully they'll have
great understanding of the basic
principles of cyber security and Walker
with lots of practical techniques that
help us all stay safe in our online
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
