describe to you is what is called the
dissemination barrier and it works by
information diffusion in an ordered
manner among the set of participating
processes and what you will see is that
it is not pairwise communication as you
saw in the three barriers and the MCs
barrier or the tournament barrier but it
is through information diffusion the
other nice thing about this particular
barrier the dissemination barrier is
that it is since it is based on ordered
communication among participating nodes
it's sort of like a a well-orchestrated
gossip protocol and therefore n need not
be a power of two and you will see why
this condition need not be satisfied as
I start describing the algorithm to you
so what's going to happen is that
there's going to be information
diffusion that's going to happen among
these processes in several different
drones and in each round what's going to
happen is that a processor is going to
send a message to another ordained
processor and the particular processor
that it's going to choose to send it is
dependent on the round that you are in
so the idea is that processor P I will
send a message to processor P I plus 2
to the K mod n this is the peer to which
P I is going to send a message to and of
course you know an example is always
more illustrative so since we have five
processors here we can then figure out
what's going to happen in every round
and round zero K is going to be zero so
what's going to happen is that since K
is zero around zero p 0 is going to be
sending a message to P I plus 2 kak
being zero it's going to send it to P 1
so p 0 send some sh t p 1 similarly p 1
sends a message to P 2 P 3 sends P 2 to
P 3 and P 3 to P 4 and the arrangement
is that this is cyclically arranged that
if P for the neighbor for him is going
to be in the cyclic order whoever is the
next neighbor so in this case since it
is mod function that you're using P 4
is going to be sending its message to
process a p5 mod n and being an NB 5
it'll be sending the message to p0 so
this is round zero of the communication
so the key thing that I want you to get
is that in every round we're going to
see more rounds in a minute
in every round a processor is sending a
message to an ordained processor based
on the round number
so depending on the round numbers around
number zero p 0 is sending to p 1 and so
on and so forth and that is what's going
on so this completes one round of gossip
and what you what you want to see is
that all of these communications that
I'm showing you are parallel
communication they're not waiting on
each other so P 1 whenever it's ready to
arrive at a barrier it is going to tell
the next guy feature is going to tell
the next guy when he's ready and so on
now how will these guys know that round
0 is done well if you take any
particular processor let's say P 2 as
soon as it gets a message from P 1 and
it has sent a message to P 3 it knows
that round 0 is done so far as P 2 is
concerned you can progress to the next
level or next round of the dissemination
so each of these processes are
independently making a decision that the
round is over based on two things one is
they've sent a message to the peer and
they've also received a message from the
ordained neighbor that they're supposed
to get it from at the end of that they
can move on to the next round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
