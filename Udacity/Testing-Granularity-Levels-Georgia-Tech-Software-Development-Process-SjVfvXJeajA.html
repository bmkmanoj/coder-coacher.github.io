specific testing techniques there's
something else that I want to discuss
which is testing granularity levels so
let's consider a software system a
system made out of components that
interact with one another so the first
level that we consider in testing is
called unit testing which is the testing
of the individual units or modules in
isolation the next step is to consider
multiple modules at their interactions
and this is called integration testing
so integration testing is the testing of
the interactions among different modules
and it can be performed according to
different strategies depending on the
order in which the modules are
integrated and on whether we integrate
one module at the time or multiple
modules together all at once and in this
latter case we call this kind of
integration testing the one that
integrates all the modules at once
BIGBANG integration testing and after
performing integration testing the next
step is to test the complete system as a
whole in this level of testing is
normally called system testing so system
testing is the testing of the complete
system and it includes both functional
and non-functional testing we will
discuss functional and non-functional
testing in details in the next two
lessons but I just want to give you an
idea of what they are intuitively
functional tests are the tests that aim
to verify the functionality provided by
the system for example if you consider
the function double value that we saw
earlier in the lesson a functional test
will try to assess that death function
is producing the right value given a
specific input conversely non-functional
tests are the one that target
unsurprisingly non-functional properties
of the system for example non-functional
tests will include performance test load
test robustness test in general
non-functional tests will try to assess
different qualities of the system such
as reliability maintainability usability
so basically all the LEDs that you can
think about in addition to these three
basic testing levels there are two more
levels that I want to consider and that
I want to discuss and they both involve
the whole system and the first one is
acceptance testing which is the
validation of the software against the
customer requirements so this is the
testing that makes sure that the system
does what the customer wants it to do
and the last type of testing that I want
to mention is regression testing and
regression testing is the type of
testing or retesting that we perform
every time that we change
our system and we need to make sure that
the changes behave as intended and that
the unchanged code is not negatively
affected by the modification by these
changes in fact what can happen when you
modify the code is that parts of the
code that are unrelated to the changes
are actually affected by the changes and
start misbehaving and we call those
regression errors and regression errors
are very common for example you're
probably familiar with the situation in
which one software update is released
and just a few days later another
software update is released in many
cases that happens because the first
update was containing regression errors
so the changes in the code that broke
some functionality that resulted in
failures on the user's machine and in
bug reports and therefore that caused
further maintenance further bug fixes
and the release on a new version
something else I would like to mention
about regression testing is that the
regression testing is one of the main
causes why software maintenance is so
expensive and that's also why
researchers have invested a great deal
of effort into defining regression
testing techniques they can make
regression testing more effective and
more efficient so let me leave you with
a piece of advice which is try to
automate as much as possible regression
testing for example use scripts use
tools make sure to save your hardness
make sure to save your inputs and
outputs for the test because you want to
be able to rerun your tests at the push
of a button as much as possible every
time you change your code to avoid the
presence of regression errors in the
code that you release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
