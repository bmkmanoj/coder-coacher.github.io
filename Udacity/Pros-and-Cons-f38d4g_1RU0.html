and it's one of the more effective
methods within the whole graph based way
of doing segmentation the pros are
because it's a graph structure we've got
lots of algorithms for dealing with
graph structure so it's a very generic
way of doing it because you separate out
this graph structure question from the
affinity matrix computation so the
affinity matrix is where you get to play
with things like your distance functions
and your feature spaces and then your
graph algorithms just run given that
that that matrix so again it doesn't
require a model of the data distribution
it just requires a distance function
that respects that there are some
challenges in general the complexity of
dealing with this can be pretty high
because you don't have this make these
matrices that are essentially n by n
where n is the number of pixels so you
want to be careful exactly how you
manage that complexity if you have
densely connected graphs because you
want to allow for large regions etc the
system has to work even harder and the
spectral decomposition approximation to
the normalized cut is a little bit
trickier to do and and then there's this
question about this balancing of the
partitions so you remember we introduced
the normalization to the min cut in
order to not get small pieces because
there was a bias towards small pieces in
the algorithm well another way of
thinking about this is we've introduced
a preference for balanced partitions for
balanced regions so if you really wanted
to have small little spots being pulled
off of something that was bigger
normalized cut finds that kind of
painful because it wants to have these
balanced partitions having said that I
will say that it is one of the more
effective segmentation methods that
people currently use and I think it's
because it has this nice dissociation
between the affinity matrix computation
and the graph segmentation method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
