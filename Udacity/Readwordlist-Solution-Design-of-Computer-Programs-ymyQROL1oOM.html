like before read the file uppercase it
split it and then the prefix set we go
through each word in the word set and
then each prefix of the word and collect
that set P of prefixes pre and then
return them now let's see what these
prefixes can do for us I can define a
new version of find words and what this
one is is it looks exactly like the one
before except what we do at each level
of the loop is we add one statement that
says if the word that we built up so far
is not one of the prefixes of a word in
the dictionary then there's no sense
doing any of these nested loops we can
continue on to the next iteration of the
current loop and that's what the
continue statement says is don't do
anything below rather go back to the for
loop that were nested in and go through
the next iteration of that for loop
normally I don't like the continue
statement normally instead of saying if
W not in prefixes continue I would have
said if W in prefixes then do this but
that would have introduced another level
of indentation for each of these seven
levels and I'd be running off the edge
of the page so here I grudgingly
accepted the continue statement so the
code looks just like before I've just
added seven lines the exact same line
indent in two different levels goes all
the way through a b c d e f and g and
now if i run the test words function
again I get not half a second but point
zero zero three seconds that's nice and
fast that's 150 times faster than before
two thousand hands per second the
function is long and ugly but it's fast
enough but still I'd like to clean it up
I don't like repeating myself with code
like this I don't like that this only
works exactly for seven letters I know
that I may need more than that because
there's only seven letters in a hand but
sometimes you combine letters in the
hand with letters on the board this
function won't be able to deal with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
