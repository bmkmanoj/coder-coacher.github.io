record our brain waves while we sleep
and when we're awake when we're away our
electrical brain activity is called beta
waves however we're more relaxed our
brain activity slows to alpha waves as
you can see here this is when we've
become kind of drowsy and when we first
fall asleep we don't go into rapid eye
movement sleep but we go down to stage
one and during stage one our brain waves
are theta waves so if you were looking
at our brainwave activity you would know
that somebody fell asleep because they
moved from alpha waves to theta waves in
stage one we could be easily aroused by
outside stimuli such as a phone ringing
or someone walking around and so on
after about seven minutes or so we're
gonna move from stage one to stage two
now during stage two which is also a
type of theta wave we're gonna see two
interesting things in our electrical
brain activity first as you see here
this is a sleep spindle it's a sudden
burst of electrical activity in the
brain waves and here we see a cake
complex which is a single but large high
voltage spike in brain activity both of
these things last about a second or two
it has been proposed by some researchers
that these help us to disconnect from
the outside world after about 15 minutes
in stage 2 we move on to stage 3 sleep
which consists of theta waves again but
also Delta waves which are the slowest
and strongest waves in our sleep cycle
so stage 3 consists of some theta waves
in some Delta waves and then stage 4 we
experience all Delta waves and this
again is our deepest stage of sleep now
remember once we hit stage 4 we go back
up in reverse order so we go from stage
4 to 3 - 2 - 1 and then REM sleep now
it's interesting to note that during REM
sleep we actually lose muscle tone this
may actually help to prevent us from
acting out some of our dreams
now perhaps you've had a dream where you
were running from someone it would be
hazardous if our brain actually allowed
us to engage in these activities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
