three JSU due to operations one is to
define a volume and space the other is
to move and orient that volume of space
as you wish this first piece of code
creates the orthographic camera and
defines the rectangular box of space
it's viewing this box is defined by the
left to right width limits the top to
bottom height limits and front to back
limits all in world space coordinates
these correspond to the XY and z axes
the camera can be thought of being
positioned on the + z end of the box
defined looking down the minus z axis
with up being the y plus direction as
usual for convenience i define a view
size which is how much vertical space
i'd like to fit in the view the aspect
ratio is just that what's called the
aspect ratio of the window it describes
how wide the view is compared to how
high it is for example if your view is a
thousand pixels wide and 500 high the
aspect ratio would be equal to 2 in
other words you'd want your box to be
twice as wide as it is tall
if you don't you'll get a stretch view
of the world which is probably not what
you wanted what all this code does is
defines a box in space in this case it
happens to be centered around the origin
by the way I've seen some demos just use
the canvas width and height directly as
the camera size don't do this you're
setting the camera size in your scene in
world coordinates which is most
definitely not the same as the width and
height of your canvas in pixels if we
stopped here and put our drinking bird
in the scene we'd get a side view of the
bird what we'd now like to do is
position and orient this camera in space
to make a more interesting view this
code does that the first line moves the
box by this amount it's a translation
the same is for a normal object the
camera controls code does two things
first it sets up what sort of mouse
controller you want for the camera if
any I came up with this custom orbit and
pan controls class extending the orbit
controls class I found in 3 j s this
control keeps the camera oriented so
that the plus y axis is always up for a
more unconstrained but trickier to use
control the trackball controls class
could be specified instead in either
case the next line sets the target for
the camera the target is the location
being looked at this defines a new
z-axis direction for the camera the y
axis is kept pointing up as best as
possible we'll talk about that later
when we look at the matrices forming
this camera once we've positioned this
box in space it defines what part of the
scene we want to render whatever happens
to be inside this box is what we'll see
on the screen the zebra
applied as usual so that objects that
are closer to the camera cover up what's
behind them this is just an overview of
the basic idea the camera defines a
chunk of space defining its limits and
this chunk then that gets positioned and
oriented in space to make an image I'll
go over this process in detail in the
following lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
