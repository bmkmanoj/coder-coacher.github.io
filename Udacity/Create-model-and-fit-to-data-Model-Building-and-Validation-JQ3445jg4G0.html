helpful here because we require a model
that is capable of portraying a
nonlinear relationship now there are
several options for accomplishing this
we might use k-nearest neighbours or we
might consider using neural networks all
you may consider using a kernel density
estimation at each point of elapsed time
in fact that might be where we go if we
did not get anywhere using any other
features to make use of our feature set
let's attempt to use a cane yours
neighbors fit Before we jump into
fitting arcane yrs neighbors model let's
talk briefly about preparing our data
points so let's talk briefly about how
we collect a series of training points
that contain enter three-time tweet
length elapsed time and mention distance
so recall in the original data set we're
given points such as t1 and t2
representing two succeeding tweets the
amount of time taken between them is
considered the inter tweet time but we
want something that's more fine-grained
than this what we're looking for is
given an amount of time that has elapsed
since the previous tweet how much more
time do we have to go until the next one
we're going to produce that information
for each pair of given points for
example if this is the inter tweet time
between two given tweets we can choose a
point here and consider the beginning to
that point to be elapsed time and that
point to the end to be the time to go
and we can consider putting that marker
at many points giving us many values of
Delta s and P this gives us many values
of elapsed time and time to go and for
each one of those points we still know
the length of the previous tweet and the
number of seconds that has elapsed since
the last time this person has been
mentioned in this way we construct our
training points
so after constructing our training
points in this way we get a total of 1
million three hundred and eighty-one
thousand and 258 points and we will
split those points into seventy percent
training and thirty percent tests let's
go ahead and fit the data and perform
some steps of validation and measure the
performance of using K nearest neighbors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
