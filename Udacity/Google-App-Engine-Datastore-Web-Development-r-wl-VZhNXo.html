real code here we're gonna do an
extended example this is going to
reflect what you'll be doing in your
homework for this unit quite closely so
we're gonna be using the Google App
Engine data store and this is the data
base provided by App Engine that is
actually pretty cool to use so a couple
things that are worth pointing out what
we've been referring to as tables are
known as entities in the Google App
Engine data store they serve basically
the same purpose which is how you
organize things of the same data type
together you know instead of having a
table for links you'd have an entity
called link and then you'd have you know
a bunch of links a couple things about
entities the columns are not fixed that
is in a table you had to have a fixed
number of columns that you define when
you define the table and in the Google
App Engine entity you can have whatever
columns you want even entities of the
same type don't have to have the same
columns this makes development actually
a lot easier when you're working with
tables often you know you build your
table and you add a feature and then you
realize oh you know I needed this call
and then you have to add that column and
sometimes adding a column to a database
with you know millions of rows can be
quite troublesome in Google we don't
have that problem you know you can have
whatever columns you want you can
actually change the columns while you're
developing it's very handy entities all
have an ID and this ID can either be
assigned automatically by the by the
data store which is what we'll do in
most cases or you can make up your own
ID so if you want to use integers or if
you want to use strings you can use
whatever you want but every entity has
an ID field and another important thing
that that will be a factor in going
forward is that entities have this
notion of parents and ancestors and this
is a relationship to other entities that
has has a couple's very specific use
cases so if it took keep going with our
link example if we had an entity called
a link it might have a parent that is
you know Reddit and then we can we can
do queries to say you know get me all of
the links that are a child of Reddit and
this has some interesting notions with
regard to consistency in the App Engine
database so it's not something we need
to understand
deeply and to be honest I'm just
learning how to use the data store
myself so I am not I am by no means an
expert in how the data store works but
something that's important is that if
you give your entity entities a parent
you can get around some limitations on
consistency which is one of the things
I'll talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
