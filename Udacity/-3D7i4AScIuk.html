nanodegree I'm Mike wells the director
for this inator degree program and I'm
Cameron Pittman
I'm a senior content developer here at
Udacity along with a few other folks
Mike and I are here to help you become a
front-end web developer in fact you are
already on your way that's right from
this point forward we want you to call
yourself a front-end web developer
congratulations tell your friends I
think it makes sense it's not just give
you an idea of where you are in the web
development world but when you are like
a history lesson
well yeah Mike you know this better than
anybody else the web's been around for a
while you've been doing this since what
like 92
pretty much although back then
technically it wasn't called the web but
yeah early Nike
well I remember Al and dial-up modems
the funny thing is technology has
changed quite a bit since then but the
technology behind browsers has not in
fact today's modern web browsers still
support the same technology that the
original Netscape Navigator had back in
1994 that's right you are joining a
crazy world one that simultaneously
stays the same
yet changes in fact it's changing faster
today than it ever has before let's see
how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
