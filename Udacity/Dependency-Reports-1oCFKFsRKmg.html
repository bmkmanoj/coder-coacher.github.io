dependencies a traditional dependency
report showing the complete graph of
dependencies and a dependency insight
report showing how a particular
dependency is included in your project
here we have a simple Java project with
a single dependency on the sprink or
library we can generate a dependency
report by running the dependencies task
Gradle display is the project
dependencies including transitive
dependencies the report also breaks out
dependencies by each configuration to
see the dependencies for a particular
configuration we can use the - -
configuration command-line option and
there we go we have the dependencies
just for the runtime configuration the
dependency insight report shows how a
particular dependency is included in our
project this report is especially
helpful when identifying version
conflicts to run the dependency insight
task we need to specify the dependency
we're interested in using the - -
dependency command-line option
let's get an insight report on the
Commons logging dependency we can tell
from this report that Commons logging is
a dependency of Spring Corps which in
turn is a dependency of our compile
configuration we mentioned that one of
the main uses of dependency reports is
to help identify dependency version
conflicts let's introduce a conflict and
see how this affects the output of our
reports let's add an explicit dependency
on version 1.2 of the Commons logging
library if we now run the Gradle
dependencies tasks again as you can see
Commons logging is now listed twice in
our dependency report in this case you
can see our project depends on one point
- whereas Spring Corps depends on one
point one point three this introduces a
conflict which Gradle will then attempt
to resolve by default Gradle resolves
version conflicts to the newest version
in this case one point two in our report
this is indicated by an arrow showing us
that version one point two is being
chosen over version one point one point
three we can get similar information
from the dependency insight report let's
run this report and see the results
again we can see that the dependency is
shown twice in our report we see that
our compile configuration depends on
version 1.2 and that our compile
configuration also depends on sprain
core which depends on Commons logging
one point one point three
gradle noticed that there was a version
conflict and resolved the conflict in
favor version 1.2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
