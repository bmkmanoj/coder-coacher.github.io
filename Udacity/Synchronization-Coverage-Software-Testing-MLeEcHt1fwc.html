look for who's gonna be inspired what by
what happens after we fix this x4
function and so the likely fix for the
bug that we had in this x4 function is
to lock both of the bank accounts that
we're processing transfer the balance
between them and then unlock the
accounts and what this will do is make
sure that no other threads in the system
are messing with the two accounts though
we're updating while we're in the middle
of messing with them now one thing that
people have found is that while testing
concurrent software is that it's often
the case that you can delete all of the
locks out of the code run it through
some tests and often it passes this is
really sort of a scary and depressing
thing because what this means is that
during the test suite the locks weren't
doing anything this is inspired a test
coverage metric called synchronization
coverage what synchronization coverage
is going to do is ensure that during
testing this lock actually does
something in other words during testing
the extra function is going to be called
to transfer money between accounts when
the accounts are already locked and what
this does is ensure that we're stressing
the system to a level that the
synchronization code is actually firing
is actually having some effect on the
execution and if that's happening what
that means is we're probably doing a
reasonable job stress testing the system
so that was really quick and like I said
we're not gonna get into this in detail
in summary if we're testing concurrent
software we want to be looking at
concurrency specific coverage metrics
such as interleaving coverage which
meant if you recall functions which
access shared data are actually called
in a truly concurrent fashion that is by
multiple threads at the same time and
also synchronization coverage which
ensures but the locks that we put into
our code actually do something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
