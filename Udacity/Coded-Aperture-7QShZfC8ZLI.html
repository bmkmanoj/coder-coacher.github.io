and benefits of this coded aperture one
of course allows you to compute capture
and image in depth just from a single
image and there is no real lost image
resolution for a simple modification to
a lens again I don't recommend doing to
wear your favorite lens depth is of
course course and we saw examples of
that I mean again we're trying to get
something out of nothing you get a
little bit of depth but not very much
and again that is because we're trying
to basically get this out of by creating
focus planes by actually changing how
the focus looks like differently because
of the coded aperture but you know we
get depth of course we lose light and we
know that right because we have a
smaller openings and this one that
basically means the light sensitivity in
your lens or the camera is going to go
down darker scenes won't work very well
but again we can actually do the
convolution and increase depth of field
after the fact from single image so in
essence this is like a light field
camera where we actually get D focusing
and depth information by changing it
something in front of the lens itself
the opening or on the plane of the lens
rather than changing the sensor because
in light field that's what we did light
for the camera we change the sensors to
be able to capture different types of
lights</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
