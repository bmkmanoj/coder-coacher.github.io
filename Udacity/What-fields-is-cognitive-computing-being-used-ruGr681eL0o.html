that we've concentrated on is in health
care and you may be aware that we've
created a Watson Health Group an entire
organization dedicated to leveraging
cognitive computing technologies for the
benefit of improving the medical
practice and the health system and that
includes everything from as I suggested
earlier being able to determine the best
treatments for in college of patients
based on clinical evidence cloaca
literature includes being able to help
technicians do a better job with
diagnosing a patient's symptoms through
through medical imaging right to be able
to look at a medical image an MRI or a
x-ray and recognized in that x-ray
within that image you know the anomalies
that would represent key issues with
that patient and oftentimes at a level
resolution and clarity that even our own
human eye is not able to really pick up
on so healthcare is a big area we're now
focusing on the Internet of Things if
you think about all the data coming in
from all the devices that are deployed
in our world today whether that's the
information that's coming off our cars
where we where we drive to or how or how
we drive or the conditioning of the car
itself out on oil rigs and all the
machinery that's deploy their and our
homes and the sensors that we have for
taking temperature readings or ambien
their air quality readings you know on
and on and on all of these sensors are
generating data that in aggregate are
hard to assembly hard to understand is
hard to derive any inspiration given
sort of the diversity information and
sort of all the noise if you will that
exists within that data so being apply a
cognitive system to be able to look at
all those signals and be able to derive
meaning and out of that meaning derive
insight and inspiration that now allows
us to think about what we should be
doing you know how should we be
responding if we're on oil rig and our
responsibility is to maintain the
equipment on that how do we prepare for
that maintenance by evaluating the
information coming in off these signals
if we're in our home how do we make
decisions and how to get inspired by how
we can in fact live better and more
comfortably you know if we're in our car
you know is there a better way of
getting to where we need to be or be
able to do that in a more convenient in
a safe way those are areas that we
within IBM we're concentrating on again
if we look at our ecosystem the number
of areas that their focus on is enormous
is diverse it's just about everything
that you can imagine in our life and our
human experience there's an opportunity
for an application to be brought to that
and enhance it in some meaningful way to
make us more powerful two big mecha as
able as humans to make better decisions
or to be able to consider information
that today is just overwhelming there's
just too much of it and we just can't
assimilate it all and to be able to
identify but you know if you will
connect the dots right to find the
associations and all the data that we
would otherwise miss either because we
don't have time to read at all which
generally we don't or even more so if we
did read it all we have biases right and
those biases causes to filter out real
information that exists that if we saw
it we would be able to make use of you
know the way the farm pharmacists or
people in the pharmacological research
industry people who are responsible for
coming up with new drugs most often not
it's not about creating a new compound
that's never been you know found before
or considered before but it's about
finding new applications of already
known compounds to solving for new
medical problems a lot of this about can
to the dots it's about finding the
research paper or the patent or the
other sources of literature where this
compound had been discussed have been
evaluated but often it in a field that
is completely unrelated to the thing
that I care about that allows me to get
an idea that eventually leads to perhaps
a new drug discovery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
