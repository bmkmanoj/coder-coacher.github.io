correctness and correctness is easy to
show proving security is really hard
this property of the one-time pad that
we can change the key and that leads to
a different message is the reason why it
is secure but first I want to talk about
how to prove security in general and
then we'll come back to the problem of
how do we prove that the one-time pad is
actually a perfect cipher so how can we
argue that a cipher is secure and this
is a really hard problem I'm going to
start with a quiz and it will definitely
require some guesswork but see if you
can think it through before I explain
the answer I'm gonna give you five
possible ways someone might argue that a
cipher is secure so for this quiz your
goal is to order the arguments below by
how effective they are in convincing
someone that a cipher is secure use one
to indicate the best argument and four
to indicate the worst argument the
choices are many very smart people or
highly motivated to break the cipher but
we're not able to that means it must be
secure the second choice there are 834
quadrillion possible keys so it must be
secure the third choice here's the
mathematical proof that's been accepted
by experts that shows the cipher is
secure
the fourth choice here's a strong
argument why breaking the cipher is at
least as hard as some problem we already
believe this hard this is a bit of an
unfair question since we haven't talked
about this yet but I think it's useful
for you to think about it on your own
before I talk about it so see if you can
figure out which of these arguments are
most effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
