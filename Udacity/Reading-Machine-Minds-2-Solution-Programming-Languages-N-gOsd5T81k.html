define a function CFG empty which takes
in a representation of a context-free
grammar a starting state and a list of
visited states and determines whether or
not that context free grammar is empty
just like regular languages we define an
empty grammar as one that accepts no
strings worded the other way the set of
strings that the grammar accepts is
empty so what's an example say we have
the grammar with symbol s and s goes to
s with the terminal a in order for the
grammar to make a string we have to be
able to replace all the non terminals
with terminals in this case you can only
replace s with itself and another
terminal but you're never going to get
to the point where your string that
you're building up the substitutions you
make results in a string that's only
terminals so we say this grammar is
empty we want to write a program that
does this for us because well can get
pretty complicated as is the case with
most of these examples we're going to
use a recursive strategy as i said
before our procedure takes in three
inputs the grammar the symbol that we're
on and the symbols that we visited this
is important so that we don't loop
forever an empty language is going to be
one where we keep visiting the same
states over and over again without ever
finishing so this is really crucial to
making this function work so we're going
to go through the grammar visiting all
the rules that apply and doing the
rewrite and we're going to have two base
cases one is that we visited this before
and this means we're going on a loop and
so this is a dead end we're going to
return something that shows that this
wasn't true we're going to return the
value none that says that this grammar
is indeed empty if the symbol is a
terminal then well the grammar isn't
empty or at least the grammar so far is
an empty we're just going to return the
terminal because that's an example where
if you start from a terminal you get a
terminal it's an example where the
grammar finishes it produces a string
otherwise we're going to go through all
the matching symbols all the rules that
apply do the substitutions
and recurse and if the recursion returns
a not null value it returns a string of
terminals we're going to return the
string back and if the grammar does
accept any string we're going to build
it up going back up through the
recursive calls and return a string that
is a member of this language let's go to
the IDE and write it out so here I've
defined my function as we described
earlier we take in a grammar which is
represented as a list of rewrite rules
we have the symbol that we're currently
on and we have a list of symbols that we
visited if we've currently visited the
symbol that we're on we're going to
return none we didn't find a string
that's a member of this language and
this is going to avoid infinite loops so
that our program terminates so before I
go on you might have noticed i use the
built-in function any which was given as
a hint in the problem let's briefly go
over it any takes in a list and if any
value in this list is true any returns
true it only returns false if all the
values in those lists are false so let's
go back to the code so going back to our
list comprehension we're going to create
a list of true and false values we're
going to create a true value if there's
a rewrite rule that applies to the
symbol in other words if there's a real
i troll where the left hand side is the
symbol that we're currently on otherwise
it's going to be false this statement is
essentially asking is this symbol be
terminal if no rewrite rules apply we're
going to say it's a terminal and if it's
a terminal we're just going to return
the current symbol we on we're on that's
the base case that we decided to do when
we were sketching out this program so
those are our two base cases now we have
to write the code that goes through the
rewrite rules that apply to the non
terminal that we're on we're going to
update the list of visited symbols with
the current visit symbol and here we
have a for loop that's going to go to
every right hand side of a rewrite rule
that applies to the current symbol it's
going to give us every right hand side
where the left hand side is the symbol
and the way it does that as it goes
through the grammar and if the left hand
side
is our symbol it's going to return the
right-hand side so this line ask the
question does every symbol in the right
hand side of a rule result in a
non-empty grammar and we determine that
by calling CFG empty on every single
symbol we're using the list
comprehension to create a list of true
or false values that corresponds to
whether the relative symbol is non-empty
it's true if it's on empty so for in
this situation where we have a list of
all true values that means every symbol
in the right hand side is non-empty and
the function all will return true in a
similar way to any but all as opposed
any returns true only if every element
in the list is true so if it's the case
can get an example that proves that this
context free grammar is in empty so we
create by going through each symbol in
the right hand side and building up our
string and then returning if none of our
rewrite rules terminated the mourner
return none because we didn't find
anything down this path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
