game for us to play and what I want you
to notice about this game before I
describe it to you in detail is that we
have relaxed yet another one of the
constraints so we started out playing
two player zero-sum deterministic games
of perfect information there was also a
finite in there somewhere
from now on we're just going to assume
everything's finite because why not and
then what we did last time just a few
seconds ago is we relaxed the
deterministic part so we had two player
zero-sum non-deterministic games of
perfect information and now we are going
to relax the requirement for perfect
information so now we're going to look
at two player zero-sum possibly
non-deterministic games of hidden
information and this is really important
Michael because this last little bit of
relaxation going from perfect
information hidden information is going
to be a sort of quantum leap into the
difficult problems of game theory so
this is where it starts to actually get
interesting so we've been building a
foundation so far and now we're gonna
get to the interesting and complicated
stuff okay
Wow yeah I mean one of the things that I
learned just now is that the opposite of
perfect is hidden yes I always took the
perfect the opposite of perfect was
imperfect but okay so hidden hidden in
France interesting so like I guess if I
don't have a perfect face I might as
well hide my face right and that's in
fact exactly the etymology of the phrase
all right I understand okay so here we
go let me describe the game to are you
ready
this is a version of mini poker where
there's a set of cards but they have no
numbers on them there no faces they're
just red or black okay okay and red is
bad for our hero player a and black is
good for our hero player right okay I
see so I said have to be red oh you know
red you know okay so here are the rules
they're all written down on the screen
but let me walk through them with you so
a is Delta card magically it will be red
or black
and the probability of it being red or
black is 50% each okay yes right so we
have a uniform prior over over the color
now remember red is bad for a and black
is good for a so it's going to turn out
without loss of generality that if a
gets a black card a is definitely going
to hole
onto the card okay now a gets this card
be player B does not get to see the card
a can choose to either resign or to hold
if a resigns given a red card then he
loses 20 cents okay okay wait so he's
dealt red Amy resign if but only if red
right and then a loses 20 cents right
okay okay okay so this is a betting game
it's not strange it makes perfect sense
it's it's sort of a metaphor for life
okay now a can choose to hold instead
hold the card that's requiring B to do
something so if a holds the card B can
either resign or can demand to see the
card now if B resigns then a gets ten
cents regardless of the color of the
card okay yep that makes sense yep okay
now if B chooses to see the card in fact
demands to see the card then if the card
is red then a loses 40 cents but if the
card is black then a gets 30 cents and
since we're betting this means that
whatever a wins B losses and vice versa
that makes it zero-sum got it okay this
all makes sense yeah I don't know if I
can hold all those different numbers in
my head but I but the basic pattern of
it is that as you say red is red is bad
black is good if a gets a bad card a can
essentially either fold resign or kind
of bluff like hey I've got this great
card and then ake and if B believes that
the card is bad then and calls a or and
it just folds then then it gets a wins
that but if B says no I think maybe
you're bluffing and calls him then
everybody's rewards are more extreme I
guess exactly so it's just a version of
Poker weird version of Poker simple
version of Poker but a version of poker
nonetheless there's a minor little
detail here which isn't that important
but you know notice it's written that a
will a may resign if it's red basically
a will never resign on a black card
because it just doesn't make any sense
and so there's really just there's no
point in writing it out okay this black
is always good sort of nothing bad can
happen to a if it gets a black card so
there's really sort of no point in
writing anything out
but that's just a minor detail
regardless these are the rules okay okay
you got it sure
I'm gonna redraw this as a game tree
which might make it a little bit easier
for you to keep all the rules in your
head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
