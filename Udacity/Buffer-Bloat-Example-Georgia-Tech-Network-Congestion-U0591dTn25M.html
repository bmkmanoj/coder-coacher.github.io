three different DSL routers the y-axis
shows the round-trip time or the latency
to a nearby server in milliseconds and
is again shown in a log scale we started
an upload at the time 30 seconds shown
on the plot now you can see that
different modems experienced a huge
increase in latency when we start this
upload some of them experience a latency
of as much as one second up from a
typical latency of about 10 milliseconds
one particular modem saw a round-trip
latency of as high as 10 seconds during
uploads not to remind you what's going
on here is that the modem itself has a
buffer your ISP may be upstream of that
buffer and your access link may be
draining that buffer at a certain rate
TCP senders in your home will send until
they see lost packets but if the buffer
is large the sender's won't actually see
those lost packets until this buffer has
already filled up the senders continue
to send at increasingly faster rates
until they see a loss as a result
packets that are arriving this buffer
see increasing delays and senders
continue to send it faster rates because
without packet loss they don't have a
signal to slow down there are several
solutions to the buffer bloat problem
one is obviously to use smaller buffers
but given that we have a lot of deployed
infrastructure simply reducing the
buffer size in deployed routers modems
switches home Wi-Fi devices and so forth
is a tall order the other thing that we
can do is to use the traffic shaping
methods that we've learned about
consider that the buffer drains at a
particular rate which in this case is
the rate of the uplink to the ISP if we
shape traffic such that traffic coming
in to the access link never exceeds the
uplink that the ISP has provided us then
the buffer will never fill the
by shaping traffic at the home router
such that the rate that traffic is sent
to the ISP never exceeds the rate of the
uplink the modem buffer will never
actually fill up this type of shaping
can be done on many open wrt capable
routers including the Bismark routers
that we've developed here at Georgia
