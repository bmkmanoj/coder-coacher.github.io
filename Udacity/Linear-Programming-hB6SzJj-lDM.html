valuation and we said that it eventually
identify as an optimal policy in
polynomial time in 1 over 1 minus gamma
and I pointed out that 1 over 1 minus
gamma isn't really a polynomial in the
number of bits it takes to write down
gamma because you can with very few bits
specify a number that's very very close
to one causing this value to explode so
in fact valuation doesn't give us a
polynomial time algorithm for solving
mdps there is only one way that we know
to solve mvps in polynomial time and
that is Dante da linear programming ok
do you know what linear programming is
I'm gonna say yes all right so it's
optimization framework in which you can
give linear constraint in a linear
objective function and in polynomial
time as long as the number of variables
and constraints this polynomial get a
solution that's exactly what I was going
to say yeah well this is why I was going
to say it for you thank you so if we're
going to use this idea to solve markov
decision processes we need a way of
encoding a markov decision process
solution as a linear program so we need
to encode our mdp as linear program so
linear constraints and a linear
objective function so how do we know how
to solve an MDP we just have to solve
the element equations bellman equations
right so i can write the bellman
equation in terms of the value function
as a set of equations where the
variables are the value function that
we're interested in so for each state s
we have a variable V sub s and we relate
to visa basis through this equation to
the visa best Prime's which are
themselves just visa veces just order it
in a different way and that seems really
good right we have a set of constraints
and if we could just solve the set of
constraints will be good to go so are we
done do we have a way of doing this with
linear programming directly from this
expression not if max unless unless max
has become linear since I last look
right which they're not not so much yeah
so since max the max over actions is not
a linear operator this isn't
translatable directly to a set of linear
equations and a linear objective
function we have a system of nonlinear
equations but that's not so good so
the cool thing about Max is that we can
actually think about Max as being
specifiable in terms of a set of linear
constraints and a linear objective
function let's think of it this way so
let's say that we're trying to compute a
max and this is just as a simple little
concrete example here's a thing that
we're trying to compute the max of and
the max is going to be some value X what
is the relationship between X and all
these values so what's the relationship
between X and negative 3x is greater
than negative 3 greater than negative 3
or in general we could say greater than
or equal to I knew that's what you're
going to say yeah you know it's always
nicer to have the or equal to is it's a
more inclusive that way and we can say
the same thing about seven right X is
going to be greater than equal to 7 and
X is going to be greater than equal to 2
and X is going to be greater than equal
to 5 and how do we know this because
it's the max of those so it has to be at
least as big as any one of them right
right by the way your bottom things as
equals greater than equal to hmm it
could be equal to five if I get rid of
the seven yes all right so this is a set
of constraints inequality constraint
right so is it true that now the
solution to this set of inequality
constraints is exactly the max no and
why is that because nine is also greater
than or equal to all of those things it
is and and nine is the max of these
things no no that's not quite true no so
what do we have to say we have to say
that it's bigger than equal to all these
things and of all the things that are
bigger than equal to all these things we
want the smallest such X right we went
to X that's as small as possible while
still satisfying all these constraints
in this case that's going to have to be
seven right right because seven is
bigger than all the other ones and you
can't get any smaller without getting
smaller than seven right and of course
men is a linear operator so we're good
no no min is an objective function this
is a linear objective function this is
ok oh good good good so that's what
we're going to do we're going to
generalize this idea to the equations in
the bellman equation in a very similar
way I look forward to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
