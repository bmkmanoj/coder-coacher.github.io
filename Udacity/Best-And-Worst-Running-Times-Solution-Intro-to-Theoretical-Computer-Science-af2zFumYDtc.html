for the algorithm the best possible
input for the algorithm would be if we
give it a string that does not contain
the letter A at all because this will
set a 20 so the overall running time
will be 2 times n plus 0 times a plus
one which is this constant here now in
the worst case the string will just
consist of a's and this will set a equal
to n because each of the letters in the
string will be a and so if a equals n
then the oval running time is three
times n plus zero times a plus one now
the neat thing about this here is that
in both cases both with a best-case view
and with the worst-case view we have
eliminated the dependency on a so we
know that no matter what string the
algorithm receives the running time will
always be between 2n plus 1 and 3 n plus
1 now you could also say why didn't we
ask you to analyze the average running
time or the running time for an average
input and that is simply because it's
very hard to define the notion of
average so does an average string for
example contain only half of the letters
as a or is it an English sentence in
which case the number of ace will be
very low so unless you have a very
precise view of the term average a
running time here would be very hard to
define</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
