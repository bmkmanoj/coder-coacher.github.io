to measure a network those are called
latency and bandwidth what they mean is
very different they're often confused
often people say bandwidth when they
mean latency or say latency when they
mean bandwidth they're quite different
things so let me explain what they are
so latency is the time that it takes for
a message to get from the source to the
destination and that's for the start of
the message so we can measure latency by
timing when you start sending to the
time that the receiver starts receiving
so this is the unit of time it will be
measured in something like seconds for a
fast Network today it's more often
measured in milliseconds and they're
1,000 milliseconds in one second so now
you understand about latency I want to
go back to the Greek signalling network
so suppose now that Zeus who is
all-powerful wanted to send a message
from roads to Sparta and he thought that
the latency of the smoke signal network
as it was currently set up was too high
that it takes too long for the message
that he sends starting from roads to
reach Sparta so the question is how
could zeus and remember that in ancient
greece zeus was all-powerful reduce the
latency between rhodes and Sparta so
here the choices it makes the signaling
nodes further apart so instead of going
from roads to Knox Oh Stu Milius to
Sparta maybe it would only have to go
one stop there would be a new island in
the middle here and it could go from
Rhodes to the new island and then to
Sparta he could threaten the soldiers at
all the signalling points and scare them
into working harder so they start the
fires more quickly when they need to
send a message he could find a way to
make it so instead of just sending one
color smoke you could send different
colors of smoke that would mean that
with the same amount of smoke you could
send more different messages or he could
increase the speed of light that would
mean that the soldiers at each
signalling point would see the previous
smoke signal more quickly than they do
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
