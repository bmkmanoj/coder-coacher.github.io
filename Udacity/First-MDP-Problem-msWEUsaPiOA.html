problem from an initial state we have a
choice of three actions a B and C the
immediate reward associated with each of
these actions is 0 but these three
actions will take us to different states
with different possible rewards
available from these states action a
takes us to state s1 from which our only
action is to loop at each step back into
state s1 accruing a reward of p1 which
is a parameter each time if we take
action B at the initial state we will
spend the rest of the game alternating
between states s2 and s4 we will gain a
reward of p2 each time we move from
state s2 to s4 and we will receive a
reward of p3 on the return trip and if
we take action C initially we will move
into state s3 from which our only next
action is to move into state s5
attaining no reward after that we
repeatedly loop in state s5 attaining a
reward of p4 at each step
suppose the game has an independent
probability of ending after each step
and let's call this probability one
minus gamma so that the effective
discount factor for the scenario is
gamma given the parameters p1 p2 p3 and
p4 our problem is to determine for which
values of gamma we prefer the initial
action a the initial action B and for
which gamma we prefer the initial action
C we will solve this problem by setting
up a Markov decision process
encapsulating this state diagram in
burlap we will then run value iteration
procedures on the MDP for different
values of gamma in order to answer this
question
