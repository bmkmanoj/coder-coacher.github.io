and you want to make an order you look
at the prices on your computer you see
what you think looks like the prices are
gonna go up so you enter a buy order no
your order travels all the way across
the country and because you use e trade
it stops in Atlanta and then it hops to
New York City let's now zoom in and see
what's happening at the exchange in New
York City so we've zoomed into the New
York Stock Exchange and the order book
there is visible to you over in Seattle
but also two computers that are
co-located so let's suppose our hedge
fund has a co-located computer and it's
observing the order book as well now
here's the advantage that this
co-located hedge fund has its computer
is located maybe a hundred meters away
from the main exchange computer that
holds the order book so that hundred
meters amounts to 0.3 microseconds in
terms of how long it takes information
about the order book to reach that hedge
fund computer you on the other hand are
located at least 2,500 miles away and
that means when this order book changes
it takes 12 milliseconds at least for
that information to get to you and 12
milliseconds at least for your order to
reach the exchange so here's how what I
call the order book exploit works the
hedge fund is continually observing the
order book and remember it takes only
0.3 microseconds for it to do that based
on what it sees that the order book it
thinks the price is going to go up the
hedge fund buys some of that stock based
on what it sees you're thinking the same
thing
so you've entered by and your order
starts making its way across the country
while your order is coming across the
country indeed the price is going up
because other orders are coming in from
other places eventually your order makes
it to the new york stock exchange and is
executed there and in fact the hedge
fund sells it to you and over this few
fractions of a second the hedge fund has
bought some stock watch to go up and
sold it it might have held this hundred
shares of stock for only a few
milliseconds and made a profit and the
hedge fund is exploiting essentially all
these people remotely located around the
country observing the order book
essentially late sending in orders that
it can take advantage of because it can
act much earlier before those orders
from around the country arrive there's
certainly many sorts of ways to exploit
market mechanics here's one more I call
this one the geographic arbitrage
exploit suppose we have exchanges
located some distance away and because
they're located distantly prices may
drift a little bit up or down now a
hedge fund might place their own servers
at each of these exchanges and connect
them with an ultra high-speed dedicated
connection and they're observing the
order book the prices at both these
locations all the time and comparing
notes let's suppose the difference
emerges that in New York the price is a
little bit lower in London price is a
little bit higher the fund will
immediately buy in New York and sell in
London they're not necessarily even
transferring those same shares they
might buy some set of shares in New York
City and sell different set in London
but they're getting that difference in
price advantage immediately now because
hedge funds do this because they're
monitoring the prices that exchanges all
over the world these sorts of
differences rarely arise and when they
do it's just by you know fractions of a
cent but those differences do arise
because there are inefficiencies in the
markets and there are hedge funds there
to pick those pennies up off the ground
again this is Geographic arbitrage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
