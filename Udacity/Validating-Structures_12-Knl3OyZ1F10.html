great for validating a single property
but to deal with malformed data on a
larger scale you're also going to need
to validate object structure with
firebase rules you can first require
that certain properties must exist in
the object as well as validate that
those properties are the only properties
that exist in the object to require the
existence of certain properties you can
use either the has child or has children
method the has children method is if you
want to verify for multiple properties
and you can see it being used here this
rule requires that the name email
time-stamped joined and has logged in
with password our properties that are
included within any object that is saved
at this location has children is pretty
simple to use it takes an array of
property key names as shown here and
it's placed directly in the object now
house children requires that these
properties exists but it doesn't say
that those are the only properties that
can exist within the object if you want
to do that you can add the following
code you make a wildcard variable in the
top level of the object and set its
validation to false so how does this
work to understand what's going on you
have to understand how wild card
variables work when you write an object
to the database the properties of that
object will be matched with all of these
named variables first so if an object
that's saved at this location has a name
property it'll check the validation
rules in here if it has the email
property it'll check the validation
rules in here now if that happens as in
if there is an extra property it
immediately validates to false so two
things note first that there's nothing
special about the name other it can
really be dollar sign anything also for
this to work you have to explicitly list
out all the correct properties music
both has children and a wild-card
variable you can be sure that your data
is structured exactly how it's meant to
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
