for discrete samples like this one in a
discrete population but what about in
real life with huge populations we can't
possibly calculate the mean of every
possible sample of size n and even if we
could we wouldn't want to we ended up
with 16 samples when we just had a
population of size 4 what if we had a
population of 350 million which is often
the case well you've already seen that
the distribution of sample means is
normal and we know that the mean of all
these sample means is the population
mean remember the population mean here
was 2.5 and the mean of all possible
sample means is also 2.5 so if we have a
random sample and we take the mean of it
how can we know where it falls on this
distribution of sample means we're
missing one important thing do we need
to know the total number in the
population the standard deviation of the
distribution of sample means which is
this here or the total number of
possible samples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
