typically do for the people that come
here wondering what previous is all
about normally it begins with this kind
of simple character that we build from
various pieces and texture we'll just
take that character and rig it up there
are special rigging system but if we
have the built-in segments that there's
no actual skinning going on so that we
can keep these guys running around very
quickly so then we'll apply either an
animation cycle we've created or
something that we do from the from the
motion capture and so of course then you
can go and give this guy a friend and
this is how we begin to build up the
sequence then the director will start to
ask ok where are they standing where's
what's the environment so we end up
building this whole location to scale so
actually when you go all the way out you
see that this is topographically
accurate it's the real scale of the real
environment so that if the director
wants to look in any different direction
they're seeing the correct heights of
all of the landmarks then I'll just add
a few effects this particular shot
required some pyrotechnics so we
actually ended up going and consulting
with the pyrotechnics guys to make sure
that the the scale of the of the
explosions was correct so even though
they're just a bunch of still images we
end up getting the accurate scale of
what these these explosions would be but
the first thing that I need to do before
it becomes a shot is actually look at it
through a camera so here the guys
running through the shot this is how we
initially compose the scene and then we
decided you know what let's do an
alternate angle so we just quickly threw
in another another view
and this is the same action but played
out as just a pan tilt as opposed to a
dolly shot so you can get a lot of great
different camera moves out of the same
action next up i want to show you how we
add some extra realism to the camera
itself first of all we select the camera
and then we have all kinds of controls
in this case I'm going to turn on the
handheld control and I can amp this up
so that now instantly I see the same
action but with a bit more shake on it
so it feels more realistic specially
great for these kinds of action
sequences once the scenes are approved
we end up taking a look at this from a
completely different perspective can we
actually do this shot and in the case of
this particular shot they decided well
let's just start shooting this on a
green screen and so how this actually
works is we can take a look in Maya at
the volume of the sound stage and we
brought in of course all of the gear the
the lights thick the camera equipment so
when we're looking at the shot on set we
can make sure that we have the right
size green screen and that all of the
technical pieces are working now you'll
notice here in the beginning that one of
the actors is stepping on this kind of
red dolly track that we have there so
what we need to do is make sure that we
kind of move this over and we can we can
place that wherever we need it to be and
our camera rigs work in reverse so right
now this is giving me a certain solution
it's all driven by the creative camera
but the actual rig just follows along so
if I wanted to take this rig and in Maya
change the trajectory of the rig I could
scoot it over this way so it's out of
the shot the creatively the shot is
going to be the same but at least we
know now where best to put all of the
gear so the last part of this
story here is once we've got the
creative work down we've got a plan for
how to shoot it effectively then we need
to make sure that we communicate that to
the clients so we give them all these
different views and usually encapsulated
into one particular drawing a page that
we can give to the production managers
or the producers so that they can keep
track of how each of these shots was
created digitally but it's not to take
anything away from what the real
cinematographers would do when they step
on to the set but at least that they've
brought the right camera crane the all
of the gear that they need to make sure
that they effectively have all the tools
to produce the shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
