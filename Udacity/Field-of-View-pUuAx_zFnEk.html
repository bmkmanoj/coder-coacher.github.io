then that is the field of view of the
camera itself so in this case we're
trying to of course capture this tree
with this lens for : three and this is
what the image is generated so in this
case the field of view is this angle let
me introduce a new term to help us
understand how we can actually compute
the field of view and refer to this is
that and I will refer to that as H which
essence is the sensor size so in this
case the sensor size is the entire
region here and of course therefore I
can reconstruct the entire tree but now
based on this we can start coming up
with the formula that will let us figure
out exactly what this angle would be so
given this H we are interested in
computing this angle which we refer to
as the field of view and for simplicity
sake let's say call this angle theta for
now so we are interested in computing
theta okay to help us do this first we
can actually look at that there is a
triangle here and this angle theta is
exactly the same angle theta here let's
just take this half triangle H goes over
there so this would be H over 2 this
would be F this is theta over 2 so theta
over 2 is basically inverse tangent of H
2 F correct so in essence theta would be
2 tangent inverse H over 2 F which is
primarily what this equation is to help
us look at this now let's take the same
equation but now actually we can create
focal length it just twice that one of
course now I have this large larger tree
except let's say our sensor is exactly
the same size H so if I was to use this
sensor size basically everything of that
image would be cut off here there and
therefore also means my field of view
should also be smaller this is my field
of view which is the same I guess for
this one and of course I can't see the
entire cream let's look at this a little
bit more carefully again basically the
sensors
I can be small then the field of view is
also small and smaller sensors of course
can capture fewer number of pixels and
may also have other issues like noisier
pixels and stuff so let's take the same
example except now have H here this was
the equation we looked at and this was
my field of view what happens if I make
H smaller well my field of view would
get smaller and smaller so in this case
let's say I go for a smaller H which is
this my field of view is only now just
this much so that basically is of course
because field view is directly related
to both focal lengths and the size of
the sensor I'll actually showcase this
using real pictures next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
