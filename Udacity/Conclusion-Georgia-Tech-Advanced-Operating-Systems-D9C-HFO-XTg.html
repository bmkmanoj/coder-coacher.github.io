a feel for how some enduring concepts
stand the test of time the ideas in
Quicksilver namely using transactions as
a fundamental operating system mechanism
to bundle in state recovery of operating
system services found resurgence in the
90s in the lr vm work that we discussed
earlier for providing persistence again
in 2010 it found resurgence in the form
of providing safeguard against system
vulnerability and malicious attacks on
the system in another research operating
system called Texas we will mention
Texas when we cover a later lesson
module on system security what about the
computer industry and the commercial
operating systems well they always are
focused on performance reliability
always takes a backseat you will be
amazed what goes on under the covers of
an operating system to gain performance
just as an example you write to a file
and you think it is on the hard disk
well think again it is a while before
your file right actually gets persisted
on the disk what if the system crashes
in the meanwhile well too bad well
things may change in the future there
are new kinds of memories called storage
class memories that have latency
properties that are similar to a dram
and I yet non-volatile will this new
technology result in a resurgence of
exploring transactions once more in
operating systems only time will tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
