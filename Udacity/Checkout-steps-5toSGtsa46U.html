now showing some activity in the
shopping behavior and check out behavior
dashboards but so far the checkout
process has been very simple steps are
view product add to cart start check out
and purchase but there are some steps
missing where do we send the tasty
dinner and what are the payment details
the checkout process itself is a
multi-step process you have to get the
shipping address get payment address get
payment details confirm the details
review order and then finally do the
purchase so here's an example of a
checkout process with a bunch of steps
start the checkout get the customer info
get the billing info let the customer
review the cart confirm the checkout and
there will be one more step which is to
complete the purchase there are two
things you have to do to display the
checkout steps in analytics you have to
update your code to include the step
number when your app sends a check out
hit and in the admin console you can add
funnel sections for the checkout process
this part is actually optional but if
you don't name the checkout steps then
they appear as step one step two step
three and so on which is not very
helpful so here's an example where we've
got step one step two step three step
four and we don't know what's going on
at each of these steps it's really very
easy to add nice labels for these steps
so here's how to set heading for the
steps you go to the admin console choose
ecommerce settings down here for the
view and then just add some funnel steps
so you add the steps that you'll be
tracking and give them relevant names
and don't forget to press submit when
you're done sometimes the submit button
Scrolls off the bottom of the screen and
it's easy to forget it
then take a look at the checkout
behavior report so go to reporting
ecommerce shopping analysis and check
out behavior and then you'll see the
steps with the new labels your turn now
to add the checkout step to analytics
account go to e-commerce and set up the
funnel steps right here then go back to
the reporting tab to see the steps in
the checkout behavior analysis screen
check the boxes here when you've added
the checkout steps will be adding the
code next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
