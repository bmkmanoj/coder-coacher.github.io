the operating system knows that it's
executing in a virtualized environment
because of this there is no longer a
strict requirement for the guest OS to
use contiguous physical memory that
starts at zero and the guest OS can
explicitly register the page tables that
it uses with the hypervisor so there is
no need for maintaining dual page tables
one of the guests and then another
shadow one at the hypervisor level now
the guest still doesn't have write
permissions to this page table that's
now used by the hardware because
otherwise the guest potentially can
establish any mapping and corrupt other
VMS that are running on the same system
so because of that every update to the
page table would cause a trap and pass
control to the hypervisor but because
the guest is para virtualized then we
can modify the guest and do tricks like
batch a number of page table updates and
then issue a single hyper call in this
case to tell the hypervisor to install
all of these mappings so this can
amortize the cost of the exit across
multiple operations there can be other
optimizations that are useful for
instance optimizations related to how
the memories managed so that it's more
friendly to execution in a virtualized
environment or so that it's more
cooperative with respect to other VMS in
the system and other things one thing to
note that the two mechanisms that I
described with respect to memory
virtualization for both full as well as
the para virtualized VMs have
substantially been improved given
advances in the new hardware
architecture so some of these overheads
have completely been eliminated or at
least substantially reduced if we take a
look at what's happening at the newer
generation of x86 platforms and we will
talk about that shortly in this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
