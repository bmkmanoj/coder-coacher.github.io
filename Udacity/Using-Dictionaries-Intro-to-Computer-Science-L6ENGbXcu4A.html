create a dictionary we're using the
squiggly brackets on some keyboards
that's the shift on the square bracket
key maybe somewhere else on your
keyboard and we're gonna use the
squiggly bracket list our elements in
the dictionary so each element of the
dictionary is a key value pair and the
entries in the dictionary will be the
elements and they're atomic numbers so
we have the string hydrogen with its
atomic number 1 and we have carbon with
number 6 so we've created the dictionary
and what we see when we print it out is
the elements of the dictionary now one
thing you might notice is they're not in
the same order that we put them there if
you think about what we did with hash
tables this isn't so surprising when we
put elements and hash tables well where
they end up in the hash table depends on
the key and the hash function is not
necessarily in the order that we put
them in and with the dictionary because
it's implemented like a hash table we
see the same thing unlike a list where
the elements are ordered with the
dictionary there's no order to the
elements so when we print it out they
might appear in a different order from
the order that we put them in we can use
two indexing to look up one of the
elements so now when we look up the
value associated with hydrogen we get
one and if we look up the value
associated with carbon we get six what
do you think is gonna happen if we look
up a value that's not in the dictionary
so now we're looking up the value
associated with lithium and what we get
is an error it's called the key area key
error it says that element is not in the
dictionary this is different from how we
define look up for our hash table right
we defined our lookup to return none
when the element was not there the way
the built-in dictionary type works is it
gives us an error when it's not there if
we don't want to get errors like that we
can use the in to see if an elements in
the dictionary so the in behaves similar
to ended for lists we can say lithium in
elements that will evaluate to true if
the key is in the dictionary false
otherwise so now it evaluates to false
so I said that dictionaries were mutable
so we can add new elements and the way
to add an element is just to use an
assignment so we'll add lithium giving
it value three note that it was an error
when we used an element like this as a
lookup when it's on the left side of an
assignment well that's an update so that
corresponds to the hash table update
where the list name is the key and 3 is
the value we can add another element
let's add another element we'll add
nitrogen and now when we look up
nitrogen we get the value that we
assigned to nitrogen which is 8 turns
out that 8 is not actually the correct
value the atomic number for nitrogen
should be 7 so we can modify that value
using another assignment that's again
the same as our hash table update it
won't create a new key value because the
key nitrogen is already there but it
will update the value so now the value
associated with nitrogen will be 7 so we
can see the first print the value is 8
the second print the value is now 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
