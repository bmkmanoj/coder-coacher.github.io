look at the second half of the problem
now that we've got all the preliminaries
out of the way how do we actually launch
a kernel on the GPU so here's a new
piece of syntax in CUDA the CUDA launch
operator so the CUDA launch operator is
indicated by these three less than signs
and these three greater than signs with
some parameters in the middle so this
line says launch the kernel named square
on one block of 64 elements then the
arguments to the kernel are two pointers
D underscore out and D underscore n this
code tells the CPU to launch on the GPU
64 copies of the kernel on 64 threads
note that we can only call the kernel on
GPU data not CPU data since we named our
GPU data to start with D underscore we
can visually see that we've done the
right thing then when we're done with
the kernel the results our nd underscore
out on the GPU and this CUDA mem copy
call will move memory from device to
host and place it in H underscore out
the next thing we do is print it out
okay we're just walking through the H
underscore out array we're printing four
things per lines we're putting tabs in
and then a new line after four and then
we free the memory that we allocated on
the GPU and return zero so that's all
the CPU code there's a fair amount of
boilerplate in here it looks fairly
similar for most programs most programs
are going to have you create some data
on the CPU allocate some data on the GPU
copy memory from CPU to GPU launch some
kernels that will run on the GPU copy
the results back to the CPU and then
continue to process them print them and
so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
