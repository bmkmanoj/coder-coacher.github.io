the first two questions in the quiz we
want to double check that our actions
and outlets are all connected first
let's check the roll the dice button so
we'll look at the pop-up menu here and
we can see roll the dice down here the
roll the dice action but it's not
connected to anything so that's one
connection that's missing let's go ahead
and fix that and we also need to check
the action for the ok button so that
looks fine that's hooked up and there's
two outlets we need to check the two
outlets for the dice image views so
let's look at our dice view controller
here the first die outlet is set you can
see it highlights there but the second
die outlet is not set so let's go ahead
and fix that to see where the images for
these dice are stored we need to open up
the project navigator here if you click
on this folder images XC assets you'll
see all the dice images here and next
we're going to go into the role view
controller dot Swift file and go ahead
and close our project navigator and then
if you look in the roll the dice method
you can see that the first value the
dice value is coming from calling this
function random dice value and then if
you go into the function random dice
value you can see that the method arc
for random is what's actually generating
the random numbers now if we go into the
dice view controller file we can see how
these random numbers are matched up with
images here in this line of view will
appear you can see where the image names
come from remember that the dice images
have the names d1 d2 d3 etc which means
that the strings for the image names can
be built up from the dice values let's
take another look at these dice values
why do you have question marks at the
end we declare these properties with
optional types because we expect them to
be nil until the roll the dice method is
called remember from the first swift
session that it's okay for optional
types to be nil the ? specifies a rapt
optional and you can see that the dice
values are conditionally unwrapped here
and view will appear
if let construction unwraps the first
value optional by assigning it to a new
variable under the condition that first
value is not now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
