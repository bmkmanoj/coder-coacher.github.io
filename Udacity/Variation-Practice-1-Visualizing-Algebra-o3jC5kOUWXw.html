35 milligrams of the drug great solving
if you figure that out if the proportion
gave you a little bit of trouble let's
see how we can set it up together
because the amount of medicine varies
directly with the person's weight we
want to set up this proportion the
amount of medicine are the dosage for
the first case would be directly across
from the weight from the first case 30
milligrams is prescribed for someone who
weighs 150 pounds so this would be the
first numbers for our first case we
don't know how much of the drug should
be prescribed for a man that weighs 175
pounds so the amount of the drug or the
amount of medicine too is unknown it's X
but the corresponding weight for that
drug dosage is 175 pounds so we put that
here finally we cross multiply and then
divide both sides by 150 this leaves us
with x is equal to 35 now I really think
it's important to make sense of our
reason through this answer should this
be more are less than the 30 milligrams
originally well we set the amount of
medicine very directly so that means if
the drug dosage increases the weight
increases as well we know the weight
increase from 150 pounds 275 pounds so
it makes sense that our drug increased
from 30 milligrams to 35 milligrams if
anything we can just be sure that the
second amount is higher are greater than
the first amount</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
