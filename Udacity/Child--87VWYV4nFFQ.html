share with you my hypothesis of what
will happen when I run this piece of
code now one of the first things we are
doing here in this program is that we
are creating an instance of class child
we call it Miley Cyrus as soon as that
line of code runs the init method inside
class child will get called the first
line within the init method is this
print statement so my hypothesis is that
this print statement will be printed out
first in our output after that the
constructor for the class parent is
going to get called so the control will
move from here up to here when the init
method for class parent is called this
statement is going to get executed so my
hypothesis is that this print statement
parent constructor called will be the
second thing that gets printed then the
instance variables last name and eye
color will be appropriately initialized
once the init method for class parent
has successfully run the control will
come back here at that point the
instance variable number of toys will
successfully get initialized so at that
point the init method for class child is
done which means that the instance Miley
Cyrus has been created successfully then
the following two print statements which
are trying to print the last name and
number of toys for Miley Cyrus will get
executed in that order alright this time
let me actually run this piece of code
and there's my output and it seems
pretty close to what I thought it would
be now I want you to pause the video
here for a second and I want you to see
if the output here matches your
hypothesis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
