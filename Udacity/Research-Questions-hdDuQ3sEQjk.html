these applications include the following
one kind of question is how did the
clients know what capabilities are
available to them one approach which is
typically uses naming that is the client
has the IP address or URL of server
technology okay and it essentially finds
that service by providing that name you
can think of this as whitepages in the
in the telephone sense an alternative to
this approach is a client saying I have
a need for service X and being able to
try to find various resources that can
find can provide that service that's
similar to a yellow pages look up some
yellow pages technology have come out
but it hasn't proven quite as successful
as maybe we had hoped second research
question has to do with use of
reflection and metal object protocols
recall that i mentioned that data can
sometimes be self-defining that is the
data itself reflects or represents its
own structure the same thing can hold
with respect to two programs that is
programs knowing what kind of services
they provide even knowing how they deal
with non functional considerations how
many transactions can they provide in a
given unit of time and so on third
category questions has to do with data
representations for the past 20 years
relational databases have dominated the
world but now there's a recognition that
one size does not fit all that different
kinds of applications might require
different kinds of organizations for the
data okay this movement is sometimes
called the no sequel movement and
there's various commercial even
solutions out there that you can
consider in building your applications
another question is fat versus thin
particularly fat versus thin clients and
this question has actually been with us
for a long time when we had applets
originally developed by Java
the idea was that the client that is the
web browser would download functionality
as needed be able to try to provide as
much functionality close to the user as
possible this is sometimes called a fat
client the other extreme is to say let's
make the client as thin as possible that
is all it is is really a user interface
now we've gone back and forth between
fat and thin clients Ajax is a way of
being able to reduce the overhead of
client to server messaging in particular
client to server when the whole page is
being rewritten Ajax is a way of making
local changes to web pages without
necessarily having full server
interaction another class of questions
has to do with the different kinds of
devices that are now parts of
distributed systems sometimes those
devices are relatively constrained by
their power consumption and batteries
which might mean that their memories and
their their chips are going to be
smaller or slower in which case the
overall device is going to be somewhat
limited that might be a reason to have a
thinner client on it related to that is
the whole question of mobility if part
of the application if the client side of
the application is moving around what
happens if it all suddenly goes in a
tunnel right and you can't reach it your
system then has to be more robust with
dealing with that kind of uncertainty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
