focus and how you can manage it in your
application now in a nutshell bukas
refers to the control on the computer
screen that receives input from the
keyboard and from the clipboard when you
paste you're probably familiar with
focus for text fields in order to type
in a text field you first have to go
over with your mouse and click on it
well that act of clicking on the text
field that's actually what focuses it
you may also know that if you then press
the tab key will then move focus to the
next text field or available control now
some users drives a computer entirely
with the keyboard or some other type of
discrete input device for those users
focus is absolutely critical it's their
primary means of reaching everything on
the screen and so for that reason the
webbing checklist States in Section two
dot one dot one that all page
functionality should be available using
the keyboard unless that's something you
couldn't normally do with a keyboard
like freehand drawing or something like
that so this is a great place to start
learning about accessibility because
obviously we all know how to use a
keyboard it's very easy to relate to end
tests and it benefits virtually all of
our users those users out there with
motor impairments which could be caused
by anything from paralysis or even just
a broken arm those folks may be relying
on a keyboard or switch device to
navigate your page so a good focus
strategy is going to be absolutely
critical for them and for the power
users out there those folks who know
every keyboard shortcut on their machine
and hate having to use the mouse well
for them being able to navigate for
instance a form on your site it's just
going to make them more productive so
well implemented focus strategy means
everyone using your application will
have a better experience and as we'll
see in the next few lessons the work
that we do today on focus is actually an
important primer for supporting
assistive technology users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
