words related with classes and objects
we will move on to creating our movie
website and here is the final output
that we are after all of our favorite
movies on a web page and as you've seen
previously if we click on any one of
these movies we see it's trailer let's
build this so here I am back with my
code now thus far we've made only two
movie objects Toy Story and avatar I'm
going to make a few more in fact for
more movie objects but before I do that
I want to make this window a little bit
bigger so we can see all of this code
really easily okay so here are the two
instances we've created thus far Toy
Story and avatar now before I proceed I
will go ahead and comment out the
previous output statements that I had
created this print statement and the
show trailer method so let me just add a
comment there and they're done now I'm
going to add a new movie object for a
movie called school of rock there it is
you will notice that I've changed the
name of the movie its storyline its
poster image and it's YouTube trailer
values appropriately next I will add
another movie object this time for an
animated movie called ratatouille next I
will add a movie object called Midnight
in Paris now this happens to be one of
my favorite movies and the final movie
object I will add is for a movie called
The Hunger Games
okay so thus far we've created six
different movie objects so far so good
now to turn this into a movie website
you will need a piece of code that we
wrote now we call this code fresh tomato
spy by the way this file is available
for you to download in the instructor
notes
now before we use it let's see what this
file actually does this file fresh
tomato Spy has a function inside it
called open movies page let's look at
this function a bit more closely now
what this function does is that it takes
in a list of movies as input and as
output it creates and opens an HTML page
or a website that shows the movies you
gave it in the first place so what I'm
going to do next is use this
fresh tomatoes pie and its function open
movies page inside our code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
