app but don't take my word for it make
sure that it runs under your phone so
now I'm taking you through three steps
to show you how to take a drawing to an
app let's recap a little the first step
was to choose your views a great place
to start with this step is to circle the
different views and then decide which
view tags you need to use Katherine
couldn't all taught you about to view
tags image views and text views and
they've also mentioned a view called a
button which you'll be using in the next
lesson as you begin to feel a little bit
more ambitious you can discover new
views in the documentation all right
once you're done choosing your views you
move on to positioning and the question
you need to be asking yourself at this
stage is what view group should I use
now view groups have a lot of control
over how and where you position your
views if the views are aligned
horizontally or vertically you probably
want to use a linear layout and if the
views are aligned relative to one
another then you probably want to use a
relative layout now once you've made
this decision if you're using a linear
layout you're going to think about
things like orientation and layout
weight layout weight in particular is a
little bit complicated but pretty
powerful it allows you to sort of
equally distribute your views across the
screen which is a really great feature
if you're using a relative layout you'll
be thinking of how to position your
views relative to their sibling views
and to their parent view and this will
be done using the align parent
attributes and attributes like two left
of and two right of and step three is
the fun step where you get to style your
views during this step you'll look at
things like the text and the color and
the font and decide what you want them
to look like will the text of a
background color
how will the pictures fill up their
space once you know the attributes are
going to change then you need to know
the correct value you're going to change
them to finally you look at the more
subtle spacing issues between elements
and you can tweak the spacing between
elements using padding and layout margin
attributes once you're able to master
these steps you should be able to take
any simple drawing that you come up with
and turn it into an Android app layout
good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
