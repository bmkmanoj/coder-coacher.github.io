extremely powerful fundamentally it
gives us a tool for decomposing objects
into combinations of simpler objects in
a structured way let's explore one of
the first phenomena that are
consequences of orthogonal ality for
this video let b be a constant vector or
you can think of the be as standing for
the word basis it will be useful to
think of be as emanating from the origin
and then to imagine a line L through the
origin that contains the arrow
representing be we are going to consider
the process of projecting a vector V
onto the basis vector be one way to
describe what this means is to let v
emanate from the origin and then imagine
rotating your point of view until you
are looking at B &amp;amp; v in the same plane
then measure the apparent magnitude of
the arrow v from this point of view
unless V&amp;amp;B are perfectly parallel he
will look shorter than it actually is
this shorter arrow is the projection of
V on to be which we will denote by proj
subby of V or the with two little bars
next to it for short
another way to describe projection is to
draw a right triangle whose hypotenuse
is the arrow depicting V and one of his
legs lies on the line L if we draw a
vector from the origin along this leg
that drawn vector will also be the
projection of V on to be the remaining
leg is perpendicular to the line L and
therefore orthogonal to be if we draw a
vector along this leg the drawn vector
is the component of the orthogonal to be
which we can denote the with a an
upside-down t called me perp remember
our definition of the sum of two vectors
since we have formed a chain of two
arrows from the tail to the head of V we
can say that the sum of these two
vectors is V in other words v equals the
parallel plus V perp we have written v
as a sum of two vectors one that is
parallel to B and the other that is
orthogonal to
this is something that occurs often in
mathematics given a nonzero basis vector
we can express any vector as a sum of
two vectors one that's parallel to the
basis vector and one that is orthogonal
to the basis vector
all right so is there a nice way to
compute the projection of V onto the
basis vector B let's start by making a
simplifying assumption
let's assume that the angle between V
and b is that most 90 degrees if you
remember sohcahtoa from trigonometry
remember that the car means that the
cosine of the angle of a right triangle
is equal to the ratio of the adjacent
edge to the angle and the hypotenuse
in other words the cosine of theta is
equal to the length of V parallel
divided by the length of V after some
rearranging
that means that the length of the
parallel is the length of V times the
cosine of theta now we're going to use
our dot product formula from earlier
substituting this expression and for
cosine theta we get that the length of
the parallel equals length of V times
this expression since we have a factor
of the length of V in the numerator and
denominator the expression we can cancel
them and then we can rewrite what's left
over as the . u sub B whereas use of B
is the unit vector in the direction of B
IE the normalization alright so i
cleaned up some of these formulas and
just left
what we need going forward the length of
the parallel is equal to the dot product
of just V with the normalization of B
now because we made this simplifying
assumption that theta is less than or
equal to 90 degrees we know that the
parallel will point in the same
direction as be we also know that the
normalization of B is a unit vector so
it will have magnitude 1 what these two
facts tell us is that if we scale the
normalization of be by exactly the
length of V parallel that will actually
get the vector V parallel
imagine taking a unit vector that's
right here and just stretching it just
the amount needed to get to be parallel
that's what we're doing now let's plug
in this expression for the length of the
parallel and what we end up with is this
formula the parallel is exactly the
normalization of B times the scalar the
. the normalization of B now what if we
didn't make the simplifying assumption
what if theta were greater than 90
degrees that negative sign from earlier
will carry through all the way to this
expression here we'll also have to make
a change here because V parallel will
now . in the opposite direction of B
since the parallels pointing in the
opposite direction this formula will now
become a negative but now when we plug
this expression in for length of the
parallel then the negative signs will
cancel out and we'll get the same
formula so regardless of the assumptions
that we make on this angle will always
get the same formula for V parallel in
other words the projection of V on to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
