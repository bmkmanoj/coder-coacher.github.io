architecture for deliberation earlier
today we will talk about a specific
cognitive architecture for deliberation
this architecture is called soar I
should mention that so not only coerce
deliberation Serkan also covered certain
aspects of reaction and some aspects of
metacognition but we are going to focus
mostly on the deliberation component of
Seoul Seoul was initially developed by
Alan noble John Laird and Paul
Rosenbloom and John Laird and Paul
rosenbloom have been working on it for
the last thirty years or so at the
highest level so consists of a long term
memory and a working memory the long
term memory itself contains different
kinds of knowledge in particular so
talks about three kinds of knowledge
procedural semantic and episodic
episodic knowledge has to do with events
specific instances of even's like what
did you have for dinner yesterday
semantic knowledge has to do with
generalizations in the form of concepts
and models of the world for example your
concept of a human being or your model
of how a plane flies in the air
procedural has to do with how to do
certain things so as an example how do
you pour water from a jug into a tumbler
notice that this makes an architecture
there are different components that are
interacting with each other
this arrangement of components will
afford certain processes of reasoning
and learning there's exactly the kind of
processes of reasoning and learning that
we look at next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
