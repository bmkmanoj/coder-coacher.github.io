regardless of the value of x if x was 55
55 times 1 is 55 FX was 00 x 120 X was
negative 2 negative 2 times 1 is
negative 2 excellent x times 0 is always
equal to 0 this is one of those
mathematical identities 55 times 0 is 0
negative 1 times 0 is 0 0 x 0 0 it
always works out x times 2 can be
rewritten as X plus X this may not
immediately seem like a useful
optimization formally we call it
strength reduction in the sense that
multiplication was a stronger harder to
compute operation than addition on some
CPUs on some hardware platforms it takes
less time fewer cycles less energy to
compute addition than it does to do
multiplication so even though both of
these have two operands and they're both
binary operators this one might be
faster on many platforms finally we get
to the last one and the one that
probably is the most controversial x
divided by x cannot safely be replaced
with anything smaller you'd really like
it to just be one one is so tempting 5/5
equals 1 negative 2 divided by negative
2 equals 1 it seems like it's always one
except for this one corner case 0/0 does
not equal 1 0 / 0 raises an exception
and the golden rule of optimization club
is always keep the same semantics if
there's a possibility that on some
inputs we could raise an exception we
can't rule out that exception with our
optimization you think why would anyone
want to divide by zero you can't change
the meaning of the program you have to
keep it exactly the same when you're
doing optimizations so one is very
tempting but it's too aggressive there's
a single case where it's wrong so we
can't use it for optimization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
