perspective let's look at a traditional
structure of an operating system in the
tradition structure of the operating
system there is something called a page
cache which is indeed an and this page
cache is supporting both the file system
and the virtual memory subsystem and the
file system has opened files explicitly
from the storage and they live in the
page cache that is in the physical
memory and similarly processes are
executing in virtual memory and the
virtual memory of every process has to
be backed by physical memory therefore
the page cache in DRAM contains the
contents of the virtual pages and of
course all these virtual pages are in
the storage subsystem so let's for the
purposes of our discussion we will focus
only on the virtual memory subsystem and
in the virtual memory subsystem the data
structures that are kept per process in
a traditional structure is there is a
PCB there is a process context block or
process control block that contains
information specific to that particular
process in terms of you know in terms of
memory management the memory footprint
of that process and a page table that
describes the mapping between the
virtual pages that is occupied by the
process and the physical memory that has
been allocated in the DRAM by the
operating system for backing the virtual
pages of that process and if the
operating system is also managing the
TLB in software then there may be a
global data structure that describes the
current occupancy of the TLB for that
particular process so these are the
things that it has per process and of
course all the virtual pages for that
processor resident on the storage
subsystem so that if there is a page
fault
the missing virtual page can be brought
from the storage subsystem into the page
cache for future access by the process
so this is your traditional structure
and what we want to do is for
scalability we want to eliminate as much
of the centralized data structures as
possible that's the key thing that we're
going to look at how we can do that so
that the operating system service will
be scalable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
