with regard to solving general some
games there are lots of ideas that that
have proven themselves to be pretty
useful for addressing this this class of
games it is not the case that any one of
them has has emerged as the dominant
view but but these are all really cool
idea so here's one you can think about
stochastic games as themselves being
repeated so repeated stochastic games
we're gonna play a stochastic game and
when it's over we're gonna play it again
and that allows us to build folk theorem
like ideas at the level of stochastic
games well that's cool and so there's
some efficient algorithms for dealing
with that so that's one idea another one
is to make use of a little bit of
communication side channel to be able to
say hey other player here's this thing
that I'm thinking about and it's cheap
talk in the sense that it's nothing
that's being said is binding in any way
but it gives the two players and ability
to coordinate a little bit and you can
actually ultimately compute a correlated
equilibrium which is a version of a Nash
equilibrium that you know requires this
a little a little bit of coordination
but can be much more efficient to
compute and you can actually get near
optimal approximations of the solution
to stochastic games using that idea yeah
that's cool I didn't didn't I do some
work in this space you did that's where
I got the idea from okay
there's some some work by Amy Greenwald
looking at how correlated equilibrium
play in to stochastic games and then
your student Liam and you developed a
really cool algorithm that actually
provably approximates the solutions nice
another idea that I've heard a lot about
lately that I really like is the notion
of a cognitive hierarchy the idea that
what you're gonna do is instead of
trying to solve for an equilibrium you
think about each player as assuming that
the other players have somewhat more
limited computational resources than
they do and then taking a best response
to what they believe the other players
are going to do this turns out to be a
really good model of how people actually
play when you ask them to do games like
this in the laboratory huh yeah the good
news about this idea is that because
their best responses they can be more
easily computed there it's more like cue
learning and mdps again because you're
assuming that the other player is
is fixed okay how about that and the
last idea I want to throw out is the
notion of actually using side payments
so that the players as they're playing
together can not only take joint actions
but they can say hey I'll give I'm gonna
get a lot but if we take this action I'm
gonna get a lot of reward I'm gonna give
some of that reward back to you and
that'll maybe encourage you to take the
action that I need you to take so that
we'll both do better and so there's this
lovely theory by a father and son duo
that they call cocoa values cocoa sounds
awesome but it stands for cooperative
competitive values and so it actually
balances the zero-sum aspect of games
with the mutual benefit aspect of games
so it's it's a really elegant idea so
basically the problem isn't solved but
there are lots of cool ideas that are
getting us close to solving it that's
right yeah so even though the one player
and the zero-sum cases are pretty well
understood at this point the general
some case is not as well understood but
there's a lot of really creative ways
that people are trying to address it so
that is good news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
