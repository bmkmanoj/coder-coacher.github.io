Joshua Bloch Josh is what is a leading
textbook author effective Java book on
concurrency in ba and Java a devilish
book on Java puzzlers and was one of the
leaders who brought Java to us and
worked on the the early api's including
the collections class and so on what was
that process like I was in the right
place at the right time and I have
always enjoyed api's to kind of been the
the recurring theme of my career for the
past 20 years but I used to write them
for 10 or 15 people and all of a sudden
I was writing them for millions of
people it was chaotic that's the way the
internet was back in those days type
systems should exist to serve the
programmer and not vice versa if you
find yourself constantly fighting with
the type system writing a program won't
compile and you just spend you know lots
of time sort of jamming the thing
through the compiler and it wears you
out and you don't really gain any
insight in the process then there's
something wrong with the type system and
and I believe that
Java's wildcards have that problem in
the case of Java you've got an existing
language that was kind of designed
around strong static typing and if you
try to put dynamic stuff into it there
is a little bit man in penis mismatched
things that are added to languages after
the fact tend not to reside comfortably
in the language and when languages grow
too much and stray too far from their
roots you generally end up with big
messes now so you talked about
reliability of algorithms you did a blog
post about a bug in a decades-old
algorithm and binary search what
happened there oh that was that was an
amazing story so I was at Carnegie
Mellon University from 1982 to 1990 or
so and when I'd first arrived I took a
PhD level algorithms course from John
Bentley who was a brilliant and funny
man I mean he started out by asking
so how Nuvi know how to write binary
search we all raised our hands we were
hotshot computer scientists got our
bachelor's and we we felt we knew what
we were doing he said okay fine you know
take out a piece of paper and write it
you know you got ten minutes then we'll
talk ten minutes later we said okay who
got it right everybody is there Andy
picks one person says put your algorithm
on the board the person does and he
tears it apart and the point of course
the person had not gotten her right he
was broken and the point of his lecture
was that you need to use invariance in
your code and in particular binary
search invariants are tricky and if you
don't think of in terms of invariants
you'll get it wrong language design is
always going to be an aesthetic exercise
you need good taste if you're gonna do
it and you are operating partially from
the gut empiricism is one important part
of what you're doing but if something
feels wrong or feels ugly then it's
probably a bad idea there are some
people who are really good at doing the
aesthetic stuff and it's of placing
themselves in the shoes of the
programmer and saying yes you know this
will feel right other people can't do
that but they're really good at you know
looking at a grammar and saying oh you
know I'm afraid that you're gonna end up
with an ambiguity here if not now when
we add these other features that we
intend to add so the point is empiricism
is great I would even say it's necessary
now but it's not sufficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
