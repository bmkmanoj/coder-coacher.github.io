and this lesson was all about complex
traits and most traits are complex and
we learned about traits really for the
first time in Lesson one now there are
two main types of complex traits we have
polygenic and multifactorial both are
controlled by multiple genes but only
polygenic traits don't really have an
influence from the environment whereas
multifactorial traits do now among
multifactorial traits that have a
genetic and environmental component the
variability seen among that trait can be
explained using something called
heritability heritabilities on a scale
from 0 to 1 and if there's a lower
heritability under point 5 then it means
that variability is more influenced by
the environment where's the higher
heritability means that the variation in
the trait can be explained by more of a
genetic component or by certain alleles
now one way to estimate heritability is
to use studies of twins both monozygotic
and dizygotic now we can use correlation
in these studies to measure quantitative
traits which vary continuously over a
range whereas we would use concordance
to measure qualitative traits which vary
discontinuously which means unlike
height which can vary over a range of
numbers from five feet to six feet to
seven feet there are only certain
options like blue eye color or brown eye
color or green eye color so in general
these multifactorial traits that show a
range of variability like our risk for
breast cancer can be measured on a
spectrum and overall this is due to
incomplete penetrance of particular
alleles so this throws a monkey wrench
into the simple dominant and recessive
traits we learned about in lesson eight
and then in our search for understanding
the variability among multifactorial
traits we can use jiwa studies or
genome-wide Association studies to help
discover correlative alleles that might
influence these multifactorial traits
and we learned all about alleles in
lessons three four and six hopefully you
enjoyed piecing all this information
together if you had some trouble why
don't you go check out the forums and
see if you had any of this
them questions that some of your
classmates do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
