finish we need to make progress in both
the east-west direction and the
north-south direction so this is my
straight line distance I can think of it
as being composed of east-west progress
and north-south progress so if i can
find these legs of this triangle i
should be able to find this third leg
well let's see what we can do first
travels east at this speed for this
duration so after leg one its move 30
kilometers east words in fact one I keep
track of this in some sort of table
progress East and progress south so for
this first entry we make 30 kilometers
of progress East and 0 south because i'm
heading exactly east in the next entry
while i'm going exactly south at 20 km/h
41 hour which means 20 kilometers south
&amp;amp; 0 east well in the next entry i go 15
kilometers an hour for three hours which
is 45 kilometers east in zero south what
about this last entry i'm going north
east eight kilometers an hour for one
hour so that would be hypotenuse of
eight but this side actually has both
east component and a North component
well northeast means I'm exactly between
East and North so this angle is 45
degrees in fact I can see that the
cosine of 45 it's going to be equal to
this eastward progress i'll call this e
over the hypotenuse of eight so the
eastward progress will be eight times
the cosine of 45 which is five point
seven kilometers and the southward
progress will be identical but it won't
be identical it will be negative or not
going south here going north it'll be
negative five point seven kilometres and
we can get that by looking at the sine
of this angle ok now let's keep track of
total progress south I'd be this leg of
the triangle here while I'm south 20 but
the North 5.7 so this leg has a total
length of 14.3 kilometers and this leg
has a length of 30 plus 45 75 plus five
point seven which is 80 points seven
kilometers I can do the Pythagorean
theorem to find this side and I find a
straight line distance of a 1.96
mama ters so that's probably too precise
I should probably just say eighty two
kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
