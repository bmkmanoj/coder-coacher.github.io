converged on to this model over here
that any cheap non vegan food at Kim's
is it's giving me my allergic reaction
we left off by saying that potentially
any food at Kim's or any breakfast or
any cheap food gives me an allergic
reaction but the fourth visit rules out
it being any meal at Kim's or any
breakfast or any cheap food it also
rules out a couple other specializations
like any breakfast at Kim's any cheap
food at Kim's or any cheap breakfast on
a more specific model we left it off as
any cheap non-vegan meal at Kim's on
Friday but visit six rules out the idea
that it's just on Friday it can also be
on Saturday so that leaves us with any
cheap non-vegan meal at Kim's note that
in this exercise there were only seven
examples and only five features so we
could do it by hand what would happen if
the number of examples was much larger
and the number of features were much
larger this algorithm would still work
but we'll need a lot more computing
power it is also possible that the
algorithm may not be able to find the
right concept to converge to because I
might be allergic to multiple meals at
multiple restaurants such as breakfast
at Kim's and lunch at Sam's but even in
that case the benefit of this algorithm
is it will show that convergence is not
possible even after many many examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
