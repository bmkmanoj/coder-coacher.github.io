here's an old cast of characters and
there's two funny things for me to tell
you the first is you talk about you know
missing a trademarking opportunity right
so when Matt Turk and sandy Pentland
were putting this together they had in
mind this notion of mugshot books you
know mug shots where page through this
book of all these face images you say
AHA that's the person so they were
putting together something that was
going to be kind of like a mugshot book
but of faces and it was going to be an
electronic program so what do you think
they called this electronic program that
was supposed to be a book of faces photo
book so you know there you go Zukerberg
help your happy face book was invented
and called photo book and so then
Facebook could be Facebook so that's
humorous story number one humorous story
number two is actually not humorous at
all it actually speaks to sort of the
productivity of the Media Lab the vision
and modeling group at the time this old
cast their characters here a bunch of
these people were students in fact
almost all these people here were
students at the time oh no there's Mike
Bo he was a research scientist but some
of you may know Stan's Clara off who was
chair of boston university computer
science well that's him right there
somebody ever heard of g+ all right so
Bradley Horowitz at Google was
instrumental in making that happen he's
right there I think that's him or is
that him those two may be the same
person okay anybody up in Berkeley
Trevor Daryl computer vision researcher
or here at Georgia Tech there's
professor Irfan ISA neither he nor I
looked like we used to look like when we
were at the Media Lab at that time but
that really is him so it just tells you
a little bit about sort of the density
of interesting vision research going on
there at the time but basically what
they did was they produced a database
eight thousand faces and was able to do
recognition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
