functions which set off making a
completely random and then randomly
flipping a random number of bits so here
we going to make a random number between
0 and 63 and flip that many bits we can
you make a much better random tester for
this particular code by making a random
and then making be a mutated function of
a let's look at how to do that we're
going to still make a totally random
alright so we want to do is change our
random number generator and here we're
going to be slowing it down by adding a
nested loop so I've changed the number
of total random tests to 10,000 instead
of a hundred thousand that's what we
want to do is a is still a completely
randomly generated 64-bit number and now
we're going to do is initialize be to be
a and now for J in 0 to 63 for James 0
to 63 so that is for some random number
between 0 and 63 we're going to flip the
sense using pythons XOR operator of one
random bit of the input and our new test
case is going to be a and an a change
version of a with the idea that that's
going to be a better test case let's see
if that is indeed the case so now we've
completely covered our code we have 27
statements all of them run we had no
partial executions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
