of learning technique we are discussing
here he might be the old concept of a
cup in this particular case this
particular concept definition has been
put in the form of a production rule
there is a new concept definition for a
cup this is almost identical to the
previous definition except that now the
object not only has a handle but also
the handle is fixed this is similar in
many ways to incremental concept
learning you may recall that an
incremental concept learning at any
particular stage of processing there was
a concept definition as new examples
came then the concept definition changed
depending on the new example and the
current concept definition note that in
this method a concept revision the
number of features in this if Clause may
become very very large very quickly here
we have object has a handle and handle
is fixed we could keep on adding
additional features will be included as
blue that cover all the positive
experiences the difficulty is at the
present time there is no understanding
for why the fact that handle is fixed is
an important part of the cup definition
this requires an explanation why is it
that the handle being fixed is an
important part of the definition of a
cup this is one of the key differences
between knowledge-based AI and other
schools of AI classification is
ubiquitous in many schools of AI as we
have discussed earlier explanation
however is a key characteristic of
knowledge-based AI explanation leads to
deeper learning it not only says here
are the features that result in a
concept definition it also says and here
is why these features are important for
the concept definition this brings us to
the second question and learning from
failures now we want the agent to
explain why a particular fault and its
knowledge led to its failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
