would cause the result to also be an
integer even if the division results in
a fractional number in Java this
fractional part is just thrown away and
only the integer part remains this is
called truncation because we're
basically cutting off all that digits on
the right-hand side of the decimal point
sometimes it's actually handy to
truncate a fractional number and only
leave the integer part behind for
example say you're writing a Java
program that would predict the number of
students who would sign up for your
course in the next few years your
calculations could result in a
fractional number of students but you
don't really care about fractional
people all you need is the whole number
itself in this case if you got the value
of 25 point five you can estimate that
at least 25 students would sign up for
your class to do that you can explicitly
convert a double variable into an
integer say you're a java prediction
program looks something like this where
you're multiplying the current number of
students by the rate of growth that
you're estimating calculating and
predicting the number of future students
in this variable future here now because
we're multiplying those two doubles
together the result itself becomes a
double and if I print this result of the
program here it would result in the
output of 25.5 to get rid of this
fractional part here we can convert that
double variable into an integer here I
created a new integer called aprox and
set it to equal to the variable future
but asking Java to convert it to an
integer first I've put int between the
parentheses here which tells Java that I
want the integer value of our double
future so if I print out our new aprox
value it would print out only 25 this
part here is called casting because we
basically cast it or molded this value
of the future variable to become an
integer you can also do the opposite
where you cast an integer to become a
double imagine we had this division
where we're dividing the variables x and
y they are both declared as integers up
here so how do we force this division to
calculate the accurate fractional answer
remember that dividing two integers
would itself result in it to an integer
value so if we print out this value of
div here it would just give us two
instead of
in five however if we try to cast one of
the variables say X to become a double
using this parenthesis surrounding the
world double this will force the
division to result into an accurate
value casting is a really important
concept in programming and you should
always be aware of what datatypes your
variables are and when to convert a
value from one type to the other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
