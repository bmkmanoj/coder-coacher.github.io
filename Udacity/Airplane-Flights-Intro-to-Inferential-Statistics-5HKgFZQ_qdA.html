dan Meyer a really great math teacher
the link to his blog is below with more
ideas around the upcoming example let's
say you want to go on vacation but you
have a budget of 500 dollars where are
some places you could go how much will
it cost to go to Reykjavik where they
have awesome volcanic beaches or maybe
dublin ireland or kumasi ghana you'll go
anywhere you just want to have an
adventure you decide to analyze some
flights and plotted the number of miles
they traveled and the cost of that plane
ticket here's a scatter plot showing the
nine flights you looked up here's the
line of best fit this shows the expected
value of the dependent variable Y for
any value of the independent variable
let's focus on this point for example
for this x value which looks like it's
about 1,500 miles we see that the flight
costs almost eight hundred dollars let's
say this is about seven hundred fifty
dollars this is the observed value but
based on our line of best fit we would
expect that a flight that travels 1,500
miles would cost more like four hundred
fifty dollars these expected values for
any x value are symbolized by y hat
whereas the observed values are just our
regular Y values you can see that we
have an observed and expected value for
all of these data values take this one
for example we travel about 5000 10
miles let's say and the actual or
observed price was about fifteen hundred
dollars but according to our line of
best fit we would have expected this to
cost about twelve hundred dollars the
prices for both these flights were more
than we would have expected based on all
of our data the difference between our
observed and expected value is called
the residual there's a residual for
every point in the data set it might be
0 or it might be huge the most important
thing is that we're able to find this
line of best fit and then use it to
visualize the data and the relationship
between X
why and make predictions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
