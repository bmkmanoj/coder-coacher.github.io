simple there's two things to be careful
about first you cannot write 1/3 because
that would be zero integer divided by
integer but be an integer so you have to
put in at least fun decimal point here
the second thing to be careful about is
Athens power operator if you forget the
parentheses here you would be forming
the first power and would be dividing
the result by three which is not what we
want obviously and here's the result if
we start with an initial value of zero
the result stays at zero all of the time
but if we start with a positive number
that's ever so slightly above zero such
as 10 to the minus 300 you get a
completely different evolution and as
you can see there's hardly any
difference between starting with 10 to
the minus 300 and starting with 0 point
0 1 so from a numerical viewpoint this
differential equation looks as though 0
is a highly unstable fixed point once
you get a tiny bit above zero the
solution is going to quickly diverge
from that and mathematically speaking
this is a differential equation whose
solution curves are not unique if you
start with zero if you will branch off
at any point in time in this fashion and
get another solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
