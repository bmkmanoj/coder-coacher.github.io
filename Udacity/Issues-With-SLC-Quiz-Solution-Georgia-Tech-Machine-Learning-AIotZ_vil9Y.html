how do you do single-link clustering
again assuming the distances are
distances in the plane just because it
makes it easy right so you just keep
finding the clusters that are closest
and you defined it as where the two
closest points and two clusters or what
make them is what defines their distance
and so if I look at this if you look at
the big outer circle you'll notice that
each of you start with any one of those
points and it's always going to be
closer to one of its neighbors on the
circle than to say those four points in
the middle of a circle right there close
to each other they're close together if
we start doing merchants it ought to
look something like this right where
we've got I don't know and maybe but
little by little it's going to be
licking these things up mm-hmm and
that's the key thing there that a you
were drawing before the the bridge
between the two big circles every point
there is always going to be closer to
one of the points on the outer circle
clusters then it's ever going to be to
anything else and so you're going to end
up making one big cluster out of the
outer shell which is kind of weird it is
a little bit weird you get these kind of
stringy clusters because two things are
close to each other if they're closed
anywhere right so I don't know to my eye
the best one is the bottom right but it
wouldn't do that because k equals to
write so to my what's from what's left I
guess I like the upper right but that's
not what single-link clustering would do
it actually would kind of walk around
the circle and Link things up like in
the lower left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
