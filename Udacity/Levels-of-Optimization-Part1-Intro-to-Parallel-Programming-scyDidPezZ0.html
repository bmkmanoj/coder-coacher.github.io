picking good algorithms obviously this
is the the most important level of
optimization and when sorting a large
random list and order in log n algorithm
like merge sort is just intrinsically
going to be faster than an order N
squared algorithm like insertion sort
and clearly this is a case of choosing
the right algorithm and you know much of
performance CPU programming relies on
making efficient use of the cache this
is sort of the number one thing to keep
in mind when you're trying to write
efficient CPU code is that there's this
big cache hierarchy and you want to
write code that's going to make good use
of it and so I would consider this an
example of optimization level two right
it's a basic principle of efficiency on
a CPU on the other hand blocking for the
l1 cache which means carefully sizing
your working set to fit exactly in the
per core cache on the CPU this is a
detailed optimization it's gonna depend
on the exact CPU model you're using
because every CPU core has a different
size l1 cache I would also put the use
of vector registers like SSE or AVX
intrinsics into this category right
these are not every CPU has SSE some
have a BX some don't have either so the
use of vector registers the choice of
blocking for the l1 cache cache blocking
I would consider these architecture
specific detailed optimizations so these
kind of architecture specific
optimizations tend to be the domain of
of what I call ninja programmers and
we'll also touch on a few ninja style
GPU topics like shared memory bank
conflicts I'll try to highlight these
ninja topics with this little icon here
the idea is that these are really you
know not needed or necessarily
accessible to every programmer they tend
to be when you're sort of squabbling
over the last few percent of
optimizations the last few percent of
speed-up I think this is one of the big
differences between CPU and GPU
programming on the CPU these sort of
ninja level optimizations can make a
really big difference for example if you
ignore the existence of SSE registers or
AVX registers on really modern
processors then you're only getting 1/4
or 1/8 of the power of each core on your
CPU so you're taking a huge hit in
potential performance on the GPU for the
most part as a rule of thumb the speed
ups to be gained by these sort of ninja
- MS Asians are usually comparatively
minor okay so we're talking more like a
30% or an 80% speed-up by using some of
the techniques that we'll talk about
with this little ninja icon versus the
speed ups that you might hope to get
from just picking the right algorithm in
the first place or you know just obeying
the basic principles of efficiency on a
GPU such as coalescing your global
memory accesses these can also often
make a difference of 3 3 times 10 times
sometimes more so these you know just
doing a good job these sort of
higher-level
principles of optimization matters more
on the GPU and the ninja level
optimizations definitely helps sometimes
you can get a speed-up here but it's not
a sort of vital step to extract maximum
performance the way that it is on a CPU
where if you don't if you don't start
doing something to make sure you're
using your vector registers you're going
to take a huge hit in terms of the
efficiency that you get out of out of
your modern CPU and finally this last
one is I really just threw that in there
for fun clearly shifting a number
casting it shifting a floating-point
number
casting it to a float and subtracting it
from this magic constant is firmly in
the category of micro optimization at
the sort of bit twiddling instruction
level this is an infamous hack that's
been used in many places most famously
in the video game quake 3 and if you're
curious go to Wikipedia and look up fast
inverse square root of course these are
firmly in the ninja category and we
won't be talking about them at all over
the today or in the rest of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
