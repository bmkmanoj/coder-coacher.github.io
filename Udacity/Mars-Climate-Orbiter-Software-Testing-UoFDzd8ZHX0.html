bit more famous bugs that kind of fit
this basic flowchart so let's talk about
a bug that happened to the Mars climate
orbiter Mars climate order orbiter was
sent off to Mars in 1998 and there were
some miscommunications let's say between
NASA and the people they contracted out
to which was Lockheed Martin and by the
time that the Mars climate orbiter
actually got to Mars which was in 1999
quite a while later there had been some
problems that caused the orbiter to
drift off course enough that it
basically ran into a suicide mission and
crashed into the Martian half atmosphere
and broke up and crashed in the planet
so what happened was a basic unit error
see NASA expected units in metric for
example m/s and Lockheed Martin
programmed in English units for example
feet per second and neither of these are
wrong I mean they're both entirely valid
ways to to program a rocket and the
underlying code was actually correct at
least in terms of this bug didn't have
anything to do with the underlying code
but because the nasa software was
expecting units in meters per second and
the lockheed martin software was sending
feet per second English units they that
miscommunication caused this drift off
that caused the Mars climate orbiter to
crash into the Martian atmosphere and
into the planet so when we go ahead and
turn this into a quiz was this a bug and
the software under test that is the
actual software of the Mars climate
orbiter was it a bug in
the acceptability test when they tested
the actual software earlier on was a bug
in the specification was their actual
actually an underlying bug and how they
planned on operating the Mars climate
orbiter or is there a bug in the
underlying hardware or libraries or
compiler or the operating system of the
rocket so go ahead and mark your answer
