scientists at 23andme I'm from Dublin
Ireland so after dropping the DNA sample
in the mail we don't see anything until
we get to our results what happens to
that sample once we drop it in the mail
where does it go where does it end up so
your sample actually gets shipped to our
lab in Los Angeles where it gets
processed there are four major
components to that it starts with DNA
extraction than amplification of the DNA
then hybridization and finally analysis
of the data to make sure it's good okay
great about how long does that process
take for to do all those steps so if you
take all of the steps and you did them
end to end it would probably take three
days or so a lot of the process is just
waiting for the equipment to become
available because of volume I say what
of all those sort of four processes
which of those is the most
time-intensive of all of them the most
time-intensive is the hybridization step
which happens overnight amplification
also happens overnight those so there
are two major parts where we have to
leave the DNA for a while and come back
to it so it has time to about what a
what I mean I'm curious what's the most
expensive part of the of the process so
that the chip and the reagents are ready
the expensive part of the process when
you buy the chip you also get the
reagents those are like the chemicals
that you need to run the chip the other
expensive components are probably labor
obviously because we actually need to
hire what's called high complexity staff
to run our process CLS stuff and then
the rest is actually fairly inexpensive
what are the are there any international
restrictions like obviously I'm guessing
if the lab time only takes you like you
said three days but you no longer if
you're processing multiple samples um
you know is it take a lot longer for any
international people who want to have
the service done so the lab process
doesn't take longer obviously the
shipping is an issue and shipping can be
expensive if you're coming from Asia to
California that's part of the reason why
we want to add another lab actually is
to help with that there are also issues
with exporting DNA from certain
countries so China and India
specifically have laws around what DNA
you are allowed export out of that
country so that the that plus other
regulations regarding biological
specimens mean that it's actually quite
difficult to add another country to our
list of countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
