at 88 miles an hour here's a finite
state machine that corresponds to the
regular expression A plus one plus let's
just to verify that by tracing out the
input a a 1 on this finite state machine
we start in the start state we haven't
seen anything yet we see the a fool pour
in state 2 we see the a self loop back
to state 2 we see the one we're in state
30 state 3 is an accepting state huzzah
surprisingly this super high-tech
sounding trace it with my finger
approach is actually pretty much exactly
what computers do under the hood to
check strings against regular
expressions or evaluate finite state
machines you really only have to keep
track of where you are in the input and
which state you're in and not much else
so let's do this together we'll write a
computer program in Python to check to
see if a finite state machine accepts a
string so if I somehow give it this
finite state machine and a a one is
input it should say true if I instead
give it a a 1 B it should say false
because that string is not accepted but
the first big design decision is how do
we represent this finite state machine
by now we know how to pass a Python
program a number or string or a list but
how do I pass in a picture well for the
state's 123 presumably I could just pass
in a list of the states it's these edges
these arrows that go anywhere that's
what really matters what we really want
to know from an edge is if I'm in state
1 and the next input is a where do I go
so let's use Python dictionaries or maps
to do this I'll make a Python dictionary
or map called edges and I'll just pass
in my current state and the input letter
and it will give me the new state at the
end before we dive into it though let's
have a little refresher on maps and also
tuples you may have seen them before in
a previous CS class but if you haven't
I'll just go over them right now you
make a new map or dictionary in Python
using open curly braces and close curly
braces and the purpose of a map is to
associate one thing with another for
example here I'm making a map that's
going to help me keep track of which
things in the world are flowers because
I might easily forget this critical
knowledge so i can update my map by
saying o roses should map to true in the
is flower dictionary but dog is not a
flower so that should map to false and
then if i go look it up later is flower
of rose will return true there's an
alternative notation for specifying a
map inside the curly braces you use to
make a new map you can actually just put
all of the bindings Rose maps to true
colon dog maps to false is it colon in
the center now at this point you're
probably thinking what's in a name is
this word Rose really important or what
a rose by any other name still smell is
sweet well we may be able to tell
synonyms but Python cannot so if I try
something like is flower Juliet that's
not defined in this mapping so we will
get some sort of key error element not
found exception for Python dictionaries
you need to get the name exactly right
dictionaries and mappings are synonyms
they both refer to the same thing a
Python tuple is just an immutable list
immutable means you cannot change it
once you make it it is etched in stone
for example I could make a tuple to hold
the Cartesian coordinates of some object
maybe my point on the grid is it 1 comma
5 I can access its elements the same way
I would for a list the zeroth part of
point is one the one part of point is
five and while Cartesian points may not
be super exciting many of you may have
done navigation or taken long trips and
use GPS coordinates or longitude and
latitude the Taj Mahal is a unesco world
heritage site in india these are its
actual gps coordinates go check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
