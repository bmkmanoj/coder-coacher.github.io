debugging statements everywhere I would
also try to debug the program into
existence just change things until they
work let me try the error obviously has
something to do with quotes so we don't
imply go and remove all these extra crow
checks in here let me see well this
makes any difference okay I removed all
the code checks let's see whether it
works right now and we run the program
and see its food the output is food it's
almost correct only the quotes are
missing well now we can handle the
coaches what maybe we'll just to remove
these other two lines in here maybe we
can change things until until think
things are proper let me see that
whether this works saying oh yeah great
let me see okay and I can run the thing
again and however i think i removed too
much at this point because if you recall
our original example the one with the
greater than sign here in the target URL
that we now still get this error in here
the quote is in here which shouldn't
belong here which is why we introduce
code handling in the first place so now
actually maybe i should go back to this
earlier version but how do i get back to
the earlier version well of course i did
never back up my earlier version so i
don't even know what the earlier version
was this more or less was my state of
debugging this is how i debugged as a
student which was not the perfect way to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
