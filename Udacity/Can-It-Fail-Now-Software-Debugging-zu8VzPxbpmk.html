only hold when C was a double quote so
first c was a double quote and then c
was a less than sign from all this
information we can reconstruct the input
that was passed over to remove HTML
markup it must have been something along
the lines of first double quote and then
an opening tag between these two events
see being a double quote and see being
an opening tag they could also have been
other characters before but in our
deduction none of these matter for us it
is sufficient to know that indeed there
is an input which can cause this
assertion to fail and second while we
were doing the reasoning we actually
also stumbled across the condition that
was wrong from the line of a reasoning
we can now deduce that if this condition
had not been true then for this input
the assertion would not have failed by
adding appropriate parenthesis here we
can make sure that this input will not
cause the assertion to fail and thereby
through reduction we have found a fix
without executing the program even once
and now for a real tough quiz in which
you can show how good your deduction
skills are if I have applied this fix
with these parentheses can this surgeon
ever fail if yes provide an example if
no right down the individual steps of
your deduction and let's see whether
this is elementary my dear Watson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
