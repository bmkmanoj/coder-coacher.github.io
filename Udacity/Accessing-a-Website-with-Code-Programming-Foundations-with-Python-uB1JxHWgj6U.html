the only new stuff that I've added to
the code thus far is this function
called check profanity by the way this
function is empty for now it takes in
one argument or one piece of information
which is the text we actually want to
check for profanity now I know there is
this module in Python called
URL Lib which helps us get information
from the internet it has a function
called
URL open which takes in a link to a
website so here I am going to give it
the full link to the what do you love
website and add to that the text we
actually want to check for profanity now
this function URL open is going to help
us make a connection to this website so
I'm going to call this connection now I
recognize that you may not be able to
read the entire line of code that we've
written here so I'm going to temporarily
put in a return statement there so you
can read the whole line of code and then
I'm going to restore the code okay let's
continue now I want us to notice that
this function URL open is quite similar
to the other function that we've used in
this program which is open open helps us
read contents from a file on our
computer URL open on the other hand
helps open a connection to a website on
the Internet
then we can do things with that
connection things like read a response
from that website I'm going to call this
response output and then print the
output after I've done that I will close
the connection so now it's time for us
to call this function check profanity
and I will do that after I have
successfully read the text from a file
on my computer so let me add code to
call the function check profanity and to
it I will pass in the contents that we
had previously read from the file I'm
going to save our program now if all
goes well the read text function will
read the contents from the movie codes
file and then the check profanity
function will check that text for curse
words let me run my program and oh it
seems like I forgot to import URL Lib so
let me go back to the
code and add that to the very top there
it is let me save my program and run
again and this time the program worked
and the program's response is false
which means that the movie codes have no
curse words in them now if I go back to
my movie codes file and change just one
word let me save this file and run my
code one more time now the response
changes to true which means that there
was a curse word in our movie codes file
alright so it seems like we are getting
very close to finishing this code but
before we do I want us to figure out how
Python knows about this thing called URL
Lib and URL open let's find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
