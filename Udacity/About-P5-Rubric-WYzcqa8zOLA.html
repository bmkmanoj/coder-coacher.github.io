design and the meet specifications
criterion for basically dreams is all
application components render on screen
in a responsive manner usable across a
modern desktop tablet and phone browsers
you want to make sure that things look
good especially because you have several
different components inside one arm you
know application you're going to be
having a Google Maps that's going to
show your markers and then you have a
listview off the same places that are
shown in markers as well as you know a
search bar or whatever that you
integrate inside your map um it is going
to filter that list you as well as the
markers so make sure that all these
components together render in a very
responsive manner and usable manner in
the sense that we don't want your list
view to completely populate your mobile
browser and not be able to view your map
it can be a toggle element that you can
sort of minimize and maximize the way
you want it to or you can make it
responsive and very relative to the
screen size since we're talking about
interface design one thing that I
definitely want to say is start with a
mobile first mm-hmm design and we say
that because it's it's so much easier to
design make something and make it mmmm
instead of taking something big and make
its fall and the next one is a about app
architecture which says code is properly
separated based upon knockouts best
practices following an MVP M pattern
avoiding updating the Dom manually using
observables rather than forcing
refreshes manually etc um so this this
goes to knock out and the JavaScript
design pattern of course hmm is going to
help a lot yeah over here now we can
talk a little bit about the model view
viewmodel architecture in general
because that might be a little calm
located to understand in the beginning
and how to integrate it in your code so
the model view viewmodel splits your UI
code into three parts the model the view
and the view model now these names are
kind of self explanatory model basically
is going to have all your data mm-hmm it
can be data related your gear placed and
in place where it is located what type
of food I think about to does it serve
anything that has got any information
yeah it's going to go in your data and
this data can be written hard coded by
yourself when you're starting to use the
application so if you're overwhelmed by
hey how do I actually put in this JSON
get a JSON array from a third-party API
and send it to render it in map markers
and so on if you're overwhelmed take one
place or two places hard-coded into a
JSON object you guys know how to create
JSON objects from project too so I'm
sure you'll know how to do it just put
in two places and try to put in these
places inside your map markers so your
JSON object is essentially what the
model will be now the view this really
is basically what your view it's the
visual representation of what you see
off your data so in in case of a place
you're going to see a marker so anything
that can be seen goes in your view and
then the modelview with a few model is
the messenger between your data or the
model and your view which is yeah your
visual information so any data or all
the data is taken by this model view
processed and then given this view du
bist lay it or can render on the screen
I know that a lot of people would know
it ask the model-view-controller ah but
yeah
all at the model view viewmodel pattern
for knockout and that's how knockout is
built upon a little more details on it
with respect to knock out would be that
um knockout essentially handles the
viewmodel part of things the sense that
it has a very nice property of data
bindings where you can actually observe
your Dom elements inside your view model
to make changes to it let's say that you
have a list element coded up in your arm
HTML so you have a Dom element that's
made up of a list and you don't know how
many list items go into that list um
everything is going to be based upon
what you're going to retrieve from an
epi and then send it to the front end so
how do I know the list contains ten
elements or five or just one so what you
can do is you can add a data bind
property to your list element and this
can be accessed inside your JavaScript
by calling the kayo dot observable
function so what that is going to do is
anytime so you give an ID inside your
data bind so whenever you call that kayo
dot observable with the ID past and do
it as um whatever element Dom element
you're getting from the Hashima it's
going to you know track that element
immediately and you know it can make
changes to that element you can add more
data into it you can retrieve what the
current data is inside that list element
so it's it's basically to update the DOM
and retrieve data from the DOM and um so
what you will be essentially working on
is the viewmodel portion necessarily and
I know that model is going to be just a
simple data you know object JSON object
that you at least two strikers yeah to
start out with um so it's always going
to be something that you could or you
will be getting an area or JSON object
from your third party API so yeah that's
how knockout works and that's what you
should basically keep in
mind the next part is the Indian from
this data usage and this is where we see
a lot of project not meet specifications
on their first time yeah and then we can
talk a little bit in depth about it yeah
but you want to make sure that you're
using Google Maps API that is the basic
requirement yeah you want to make sure
you're using least one third party data
API and to make sure places google
places in google street view do not fall
under this both of these eps are
actually a part of google maps yeah
they're like a library undergo colossal
api so um it's great if you integrate it
but if we would want a mother a third
party aap I'm apart from the google ones
yeah and there's no interesting ones
that we have seen now a lot of people
use the usual gelb and Instagram and
Wikipedia foursquare flickr so you can
use any third-party imei as long as it
has documentation that we can read an
undersea also that on some of these
third-party api's might have um a lot of
hot stuff to do like authentication and
authorization like I know that a lot of
people have tried using YouTube API and
the YouTube API definitely needs an
OAuth and you have tutorials for it in
the google developers website so if you
ask if you guys would ask me how do I
learn these tariffs party aap ice just
go to their own documentation like Yelp
has a developer's page where they talk
about their search api and you know
other AP is that you can take and sort
of like the attributes that you need to
query them using to get places and
restaurants or with a particular
location or so on so definitely if you
want to get started with an API that you
have no experience with what i would do
is to go read their developer
documentation and then find tutorials
good trustworthy tutorials around it a
very important point is whenever you're
using a third-party api you need to
enable cross-origin resource sharing for
some more
these AP is so make sure that you know
so that your app is actually able to
access you know other API is data from
other API so definitely go and look in
to enable court argh to make sure that
you know you don't have to handle any
additional you know condition in using
those AP is so do do please do read
documentation I think the next big part
of this is no asynchronous all data
requests are retrieved in an
asynchronous manner and I think this
part is blue done with the model view
viewmodel part but where a lot of
students stumble is in the event of a
failed data retrieval retrieval errors
are handled gracefully and we do explain
what our error handling gracefully what
do you mean by that you when an API
cannot load its data that's right you
either want to pop up an error message
Len says hey sorry non-working back
later or you want to have a project or
your UI should not get affected by data
retrieval so what an easy way to check
what happens when you block as a certain
API is to go go and play around with
your hosts files yeah there are two main
methods to check it using host files as
gary was mentoring and oh there's
another one which is by blocking your
internet connection i'm going to go sudo
nano / I did yeah I shows ya and this is
what will open up I hadn't just check
this like a minute back so it's not
asking me for my password yeah otherwise
it would and what you want to do is have
Gus hashtag space custom and then you're
going to add the local posts oh yeah and
then master my google api api scom
mm-hmm or any other
api that you might want to block yeah
and that would be Sierra corn and once
you do this you want to hit ctrl + o
together and then hit enter and what
this is going to do is basically block
my API is now and then you can open up
your application and what Google Maps
usually does is it just gives a great
grey screen so doesn't give you any air
it doesn't look very pretty in your
application just gives you a brick grey
screen say and what happens usually is
there is an error in the Google
developer Chrome's console where it says
google is not defined so all you need to
do is add a condition that would you
know actually handle when Google is
undefined so when Google is undefined
show an error you know render an image
that says something or you know
something else that hey sorry our app is
not functioning right now please come
back and check later or something like
that and you can check it with disabling
your internet connection as well I
believe I think that should work as well
um so those are the ways to sort of
check how your application is reacting
when a failure occurs then the first one
we got baddest map functionality and am
a pre presentation of identified
locations is provided runs error free
and is presented in a usable and
responsive manner we keep seeing this
usable in responsive manner which takes
you back to the interface design start
on a small string device and go to a
large screen device you basically want
to see those markers yeah we need those
markers to be clickable and change their
styling when they're clicked on my
favorite one was or I shouldn't see my
favorite one but the bobbing one is the
most common rÃ©alisÃ©e you can change
the color of the marker you can be a
subtle change doesn't have to go from
red to black yeah i think but least
need to see something of a change make
sure that you're filtering your markers
at the same time updating your list view
as well so that should be responsive
like you don't want all the our markers
to show up even when you are filtering
the list or searching a specific you
know place in the list that's not a very
usable design of your application if you
have to like go through each of your
markers to actually find the place you
are looking for so just make sure that
your search functionality the keyword um
updates your list as well as your
markers vice versa um would also be good
that when you click on a marker it
somehow highlights the place that you
have clicked on in your list view that's
wrong yeah so hmm all right um this is
an easy one the location details
functionality functionality providing
additional data about a location is
provided runs error free and it's
presented in the usable responsive
manner so we really want you to get
responsive design use in this fun in
this with this project obviously and we
want to see some additional info
provided about the location you can
choose how you want implemented the most
common implementation is when you click
on a marker it opens an info window with
something more about the place meteor
phone number its phone number Yelp
address address location details yeah
anything even if you give the lat and
longitude it's it's yeah I know some
people attach like links to youtube
videos or Instagram pictures and so on
that's going above and beyond it's
awesome but start out small on the time
and then go start enhancing your project
if you even say even with that third
party epi implement Google Maps the way
you would want it implemented first
began where you jump on and take the
rice big thing yeah adding another
third-party I the search functionality
has a search function is provided runs
error free and is presented in the
usable in responsive mountain that's
again the search function is more like a
filtering
operation from your list so if I have an
ax and Annabelle when i type Anna I want
to be able to see both Anna and
Annabelle and the moment I dig that be
it's wonderful is that and I go away and
I can see just Annabelle yeah we
actually don't give you guidelines on
how smart your searches but we want to
see some kind of search right just if
you want to put a full keyword and
search it you can do it that way if you
want just by a single letter you can do
it that way but we want to see that
filtering is going on and that you know
that is going to in turn trigger your
markers and your list to be updated is
what we want to see get out of it um and
we also want you to code in more than
one place since we want you to be able
to search and show that away i have 10
places list with more than one element
exactly i have one you know ten places
and i type this letter and one of them
show up or five of them show up so we
definitely do want to test that
functionality out if you're going to be
using only one place it sort of makes it
difficult for us to even like check if
your functionality works fine it's just
yeah make sure that you know it returns
multiple places well even if you have
few places and I type something that I
might not see in someone's list you I
usually just go with my name well if
that doesn't show up I can see that
you're listening okay I you can
definitely uh if you want to go above
and Leon implement text completion yeah
autocomplete yeah that's right
autocomplete we have seen some of those
projects now and we have fun to play
around button keyboard shortcuts would
be another one mm-hmm the next part of
different brick is basically talking
about the ListView Alyssa few or some
other variation of browsing with the
content is provided runs error free and
is presented in the usable responsive
man you can you can chew
you have a typical ListView yeah if you
want but it is in double quotes so if
you think of a creative way of
representing all the locations that you
have beyond the markers please go ahead
do that we would love to see that
project yeah I think that's pretty easy
to understand point the next few ones
are again you are going to be destined
for quality you have been getting good
reviews now so we have added that detail
to our evaluations so make sure your
code is clean you comment it you don't
have commented code left in your project
and I understand sometimes it's just
nice to have oh I had that I had it work
this way but remember you're using
github yeah so you have version
controlling and building you can go back
and you go forward with whatever that
you are doing you can host that thing on
a completely different branch because
what we are looking for is on the master
branch and like production quality go
tends to be on the master branch yeah
that is the reason why we want to check
on the your master lunch the last one is
the readme something that you have been
doing since project one and this is the
second last penguin you will be doing it
in this 90 degree program make sure we
you tell us how to run your application
if you need us to unlock it have
instructions for that most of you have
been or most of the projects that i have
seen have just been located somewhere on
the public internet and its really nice
to see this yeah yeah and don't forget
build tools as well if you want to go
above and beyond um you you have learned
a lot of useful like techniques and you
know optimization therefore it's in
project for and you do want to you're
going to have a ton of JavaScript CSS
code I bet in this application so it's
always important to make them render
blocking make sure that they are all
minified and don't have extra spaces
that could potential
we make you our storage as well do a
higher you know value so I'm just make
sure that you know all your code is
optimized if you can of course this is
optional I'm not like you know pressing
it on you guys to do it but um it's
definitely a good practice and you can
sort of like remember you can if you
want to sort of refresh your mind from
project for and be like I want to try
using grunt or a gulp again you know in
this project and it seems like I have
all this like javascript file that can
that I can concatenate and minify and
then use them all to host my page and it
will be more efficient and faster when I
do that go ahead and do it um add it in
the readme and just make sure that you
send us a readable copy as well because
we definitely want to be seeing how
you've written your JavaScript code um
and I know that a lot of people have
been asking me hey I'm so overwhelmed
I'm unstuck at this point where I have
my google maps built-in I don't know how
to go forward I don't know how to make
things work um so what I would say is um
we are looking for knock knock out only
when you make changes to your list view
or only when you make changes to
filtering your JSON array that you get
back from an API so Google Maps is a
view model by itself so you don't need
to put that inside your view model class
I know that a lot of students have this
question off hey I don't know where
Google Maps goes exactly into the MVC
pattern so it's a removable formats yeah
yeah and um you don't need to worry
about using data bind on your marker
objects on in or anything of that sort
all you need to worry about is whatever
like ways that you manipulate this area
of objects that you are going to show in
your list item should be using
observables and should be in your view
model and the same filtering or whatever
mechanism you do and get the filter
this make sure that it's always rip like
reflected in your Google Maps API so
make sure that your list view and your
google map it Maps API are in sync when
they are rendering all the places but
you don't need to worry about
integrating data bindings into a Google
not object that is going to get
complicated when you start out doing I
have not tried that personally and I'm
going to be open about it so I don't
know how well that would work or if it
would work so you don't need to worry
about applying knockouts principles on
your google maps just make sure that
outside of it whatever Dom element that
you create outside of the Google Maps
need to be updated dynamically during
your run time I need to use lockout so
definitely go with that approach in mind
and if you want all you need to worry
about is to set google maps aside and
get data from third party aap eyes and
be able to render that thick data in
list view using knock out that should be
your first objective and then integrate
it all together if it gets overwhelming
and they start out with a google map I
would also say you blended a Google map
in your project yes so going back and
seeing what was done over there might be
a good place to start as Liam yeah and
you have like create documentation
around yes so yeah go ahead just read up
on that it's a great place to start and
then you can you can start with the map
that's tiny and then work on making it
bigger oh yeah exactly more
functionality either didn't do it um and
yeah we do have like a lot of medium
through which you can communicate with
your peers and with your coaches so feel
free to leverage that as well I bet just
the way we are having about it this
Union who submitted pencil is happy
about it yeah and if you've come to
project 5 it means it's a great
achievement for you guys it's yep it's
you've learned a lot and you're here and
that's why you're at that point so do
not get frustrated it can be
overwhelming but it's how you take it
it's
going to be a lot of learning experience
for you it might be frustrating but it's
going to have you're going to get a
great satisfaction when you actually see
these you know I've been running and I'm
sure that you guys can get there for
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
