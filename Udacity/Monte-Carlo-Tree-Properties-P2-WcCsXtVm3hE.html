horizon is that the horizon isn't just
something you make up right the horizon
actually depends upon things like your
discount factor if you have a very small
discount factor then so far out in the
future it doesn't matter what's
happening anyway and so you can do
better but if you have a reasonable
discount factor then you're gonna have
to look pretty far in the future to get
a good estimate of taking a particular
action in a particular state okay makes
sense right so this is both good and bad
right Monte Carlo is kind of neat
because it's sort of neat on its own
it's very useful it's one way of dealing
with scale it's completely compatible
with options and other things that we
know it has a bunch of dials in it that
we can play with that sort of help us
and that we might be able to take cool
advantage of but you still need lots and
lots and lots and lots of samples in
order to make it work which is true for
any Monte Carlo method so is there a
sense in which we traded you know in big
state spaces we traded being exponential
in the size the number of state features
say for instead exponential in the size
of the horizon yeah and that that
trade-off is I mean it's it's right here
I suppose this is our trade-off and
you're right and that makes sense right
so before with the kind of algorithms
that we've used before you visit all the
states you backup information about them
and so on and so forth so that clearly
has to depend upon the number of states
here we're not worrying about the states
what we're doing is we're just looking
forward into the future by doing
simulation and so every single time we
have to look forward to the future we
have to look forward into the future and
perhaps we have to look forward very far
into the future and somehow because
we're doing this kind of Monte Carlo
thing we're doing kind of I don't know
I'd like a almost a nonparametric
estimate of whatever the the true
transition model is that's going to
require lots and lots of states and more
lots and lots of samples and more and
more samples the further out into the
future that we go so we are going to be
trading that off
we're always trading off kind of space
versus time in a particular way in here
the space is represented by the states
as opposed to the time which is
represented by how far out you're going
to search oh that's nice
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
