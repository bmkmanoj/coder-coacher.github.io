in a given month was equal to the number
of rabbits the previous month plus the
number of rabbits two months ago in this
new model we have the same number of
growth of rabbits but instead we're
going to subtract the number of rabbits
that are five months old to account for
them dying astute readers will know that
this doesn't actually model death
correctly of rabbits but it's a good
example for coding a recursive function
so with this in mind let's get to the
programming so the first thing I've done
is at our base case which was defined in
the problem statement and if it's not
the base case we're just going to plug
in the formula that we got from the
problem statement so this may look like
it's finished but there's one issue and
that is what we do in say N equals 3
when 3 minus 5 is a negative number and
we don't have anything to account for
that we're just going to continue
forever basically because we're never
going to hit the base case of 1 or 2 so
we need to actually add a second base
case in our second base case basically
says if we had a number that's not 1 or
2 or below 1 or 2 then we're going to
return 0 and not affect the count of the
number of rabbits alive for that month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
