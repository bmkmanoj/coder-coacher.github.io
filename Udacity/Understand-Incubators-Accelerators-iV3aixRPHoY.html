how can they help your startup
incubators and accelerators are programs
meant to speed up the growth and success
of startups they provide resources for
your idea and give you the focus and
direction necessary to gain subtraction
for your business think of them
basically like how an incubator works
for an egg the egg like your idea
already exists but it's the resources
and careful nurturing of it that allow
it to grow into its new environment
let's take a look at some of the
benefits of working with incubators and
accelerators
the main benefits you'll get in these
programs are networking and services
first networking incubators and
accelerators provide a ton of
opportunities for networking between you
other entrepreneurs and coaches that are
part of the program this can help you
gain the foundation you need to mature
as a business next services the
connections you get often extend beyond
coaches into networks you can use to get
funding services and mentorship which
can be an invaluable asset to the growth
of your startup if you don't currently
have a strong Network or don't know
where to get the skills you need this
can be a great place to start so those
are some of the benefits but what are
some of the downsides
here's to focus and equity first while
all of this guidance and networking can
be an incredible experience this can
make it difficult to focus on your
business and give it the attention it
needs to grow effectively make sure to
find the balance between meeting people
to talk about your business and actually
building it next equity both incubators
and accelerators are meant to jumpstart
your business and what they want in
return is equity you're likely to give a
substantial amount of equity in return
for your experience if your business
takes off this can become very costly
later on you'll need to be sure the
value you're getting is worth the value
you're giving up if you have strong
connections or are growing quickly
already then these programs might not
provide the right value for you moving
forward there are tons of incubators and
accelerators to choose from and none of
them are quite the same so it's
difficult to gauge how effective they
could be for your business explore
different options and take some time to
consider if you think incubators or
accelerators could be right for your
business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
