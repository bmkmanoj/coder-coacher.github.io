we get into the details of that I want
to define a couple of terms because
we're going to be throwing these terms
out all throughout the lessons that I
want to make certain that we're all on
the same page and we mean the same thing
but we're returning to this again and
again and again so the first term I want
to introduce is the notion of instances
so instances or another way of thinking
about them is input those are vectors of
value of attributes that define whatever
your input space is so they can be
pictures and all the pixels that make up
pictures like we've been doing so far
before they can be credit score examples
like how much money I make or how much
money Michael makes how much money I
wish I made so on and so forth so
whatever your input value is whatever it
is you're using to describe the input
whether it's pixels or it's discrete
values those are your instances the set
of things that you're looking at so you
have instances that's the set of a set
of inputs that you have and then what
we're trying to find is some kind of
function and that is the concept that we
care about and this function actually
Maps inputs to outputs so it takes the
instances and maps them in this case to
some kind of output such as true or
false this is the the categories of
things that we're worried about and for
most of the conversation that we're
going to be having we're going to be
thinking about binary classification
just true and false but the truth is
this would work whether there were three
outputs as we did with high school
college or grad school or whether there
were 250 as we were contemplating for
ages but the main thing here is the
concept is the function that we care
about that's going to map pictures for
example to true or false so okay so I
get I get to use the word instance right
instance is just like a single thing
that's out there but I have an intuitive
notion of what a concept is how does
that relate to this more formal notion
like can we connect this to kind of the
intuitive notion of what a concept is uh
I guess okay so a concept I don't know
but how would you want to put that so a
concept is something that I mean we're
talking about it as a notion of a
function so what it means formally is
that you have some input like a picture
and it immediately Maps anything in that
input space to some particular define
output space like true or false or male
or female or credit credit worthy or not
intuitively a concept is an idea that
describes a set of things right so we
can talk about maleness or femaleness we
could talk about short and tall we can
talk about college students and grad
students and so the concept is the
notion of what creditworthiness is what
a male is what a college student is okay
I think I see that so essentially if you
want to think of tall as the concept of
tallness one way to define it is to say
well in general liking if you give me
something I can tell you whether or not
it's tall so it's going to map those
some things to our my tall or not true
or false right exactly and so really
when you think about any concept I mean
when we talk about this in general in
air right a concept is effectively a way
of saying it is actively a set of things
that are a part of that concept so you
can have a concept of a car and if I
gave you cars you would say these things
are in it and if I gave you non cars you
would say they are not and so a concept
is therefore by definition a mapping
between objects in the world and
membership in a set which makes it a
function okay that makes sense okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
