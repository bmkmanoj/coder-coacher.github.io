character in the text so if the text has
at least one character then there's
going to be a match and the match is
going to have a remainder which is all
the rest of the text so that remainder
is a set and it's a set of one element
and the element is the text from the
first character on in other words
dropping off the zeroth character and
we're going to return that if there is
any text at all that is if the text is
not empty otherwise if the text is empty
then we're going to return the null set
to find the null set down here how about
for one of so one of takes a string of
possible characters and what it should
return is similar to dot it should
return the remaining characters if the
first character is equal to one of the
characters in X so we're going to return
exactly the same thing is that
consisting of a single answer which is
the original text with the first
character dropped off and we're going to
return that and what I'd like to be able
to say if the text starts with any of
the characters in X and it turns out
that I can actually say exactly that X
text that starts with X if I arranged to
have X be a tuple of characters rather
than a character string here I have the
documentation from the Python manual for
the string that starts with method and
it says it's true if the string starts
with the prefix so we can ask does some
string start with a particular string
yes or no but prefix can also be a tuple
of prefixes to look for so all we have
to do is arrange for that X to be a
tuple and then it automatically searches
for all of them so what I'm saying is I
want the API function one of ABC that
should return some object and we're not
yet specify what that object is such
that the operator of that object is one
of and the X for that object should be
the tuple a B C so it's a little sort of
a little optimization here that I've
defined the API to construct an object
of just the right form so that I can use
it efficiently here and just go ahead
and check
does the text start with any one of the
possible X's otherwise return no now if
you didn't know about this form of tech
stuff starts with you could have just
checked to see if any of the characters
c4c enx so we'd say we return the rest
of the string if any of the characters
in X if the text starts with any one of
those characters otherwise return no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
