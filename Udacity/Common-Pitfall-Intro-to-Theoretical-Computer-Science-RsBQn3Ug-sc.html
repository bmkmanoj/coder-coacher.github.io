computer the halting problem is
decidable using the following argument
so you're given a program and you're
given an input and you put it into the
following algorithm you start out by
simulating step one of the program so
again you use the simulation here just
as in previous units so you simulate
step one if the program terminates at
that step then we output yes and else we
record a snapshot of the Machine of the
simulated machine of course and what I
mean by snapshot is something you might
remember from the NP completeness proof
of SAT a snapshot is a complete picture
of the memory of the machine as well as
the line where the program is currently
at and the reason why this algorithm is
doing it is it's using one property of
an infinite loop and that is if a
machine goes into an infinite loop then
snap shots at some point in time must
repeat so the third step of the
algorithm is it takes that snapshot that
it has just recorded and compares it
against all previous snapshots of the
machine and if it finds just one
duplicate it knows the machine has been
exactly at that place before which means
it will also return to that place an
infinite number of times in that case
the halting algorithm or at least this
algorithm here which is supposed to
solve the halting problem would output
no and then the algorithm would simulate
the next step of the program and go to
step number two this algorithm would be
guaranteed to terminate at a certain
point in time either if the program
itself terminates or the simulation of
the program indicates that it terminates
or if the program goes into an infinite
loop here it's important that we have a
real computer because if we have a real
computer we do not have infinite memory
so if we do not have infinite memory and
the program goes to into an infinite
loop then at a certain point in time we
must have a repeating snapshot now if we
had infinite memory that would not be
the case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
