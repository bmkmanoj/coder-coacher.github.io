can figure out a sensible way to do this
so we've got some pool of randomness and
one approach would be to extract a seed
from that pool use our encryption
function we'll make the seed the message
we'll select the key is zero we'll get
an output from that and we'll make a
copy of that put that's going to be our
first random value and will encrypt
again using the previous output as the
new input using the key 0 again and
extracting the next random number so the
second option we're going to extract the
seed from our random random pool we'll
use that as the key to encrypt and for
the first random output we'll get the
result of encrypting 0 with that key for
the next one we'll get the result of
encrypting 1 with that key we'll keep
using the same key encrypting and
getting a new random value as our output
and for our third option we'll extract
new values from the random police time
will encrypt a message selector from the
random pool with a key selected from the
random pool to get X 0 to get the next
random number will extract a new message
from the random pool and a new key and
do that encryption so which one of these
options makes the most sense for a
pseudo-random number generator and let's
assume our encryption function behaves
well it provides a mapping between keys
and messages that's hard to invert if
you don't have the key and that we have
a random pool that provides a limited
but good source of randomness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
