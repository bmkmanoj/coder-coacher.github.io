skills that we've been learning combine
them with our probability skills and
we're going to make it harder because
we're taking a sex linked recessive
trait and we're talking about
probability I want another probability
of each of these parental couplings
causing an affected offspring well we
know it's sex linked so this father
right who's affected could not have
passed on the affected allele to this
father a he's unaffected right there's
no way he could pass this allele on
right we assume someone mating him from
the outside is homozygous unaffected so
the probability of having an affected
child is zero here now let's come over
here to the right and do the same thing
we have an affected father you might
think oh gosh well that means he has a
higher probability of passing it on and
having an affected child well if he
hasn't affected act he's only going to
pass his why onto a son so the Sun can't
be affected and if he passes it on to
his daughter the daughter is not going
to be affected because she'll be
heterozygous right because this mating
in from the outside we assumed to be
homozygous unaffected so she may carry
the allowable should be unaffected so
again zero probability but now let's
take the middle scenario the father must
have passed on this allele to his
daughter so we have x + + x-
heterozygous here we are going to assume
homozygous unaffected so x + y these are
definite probabilities one and one or if
they have a daughter the father's got to
pass on one x and it's going to be
unaffected allele and the mom can pass
on either or right plus or minus in a
won't matter because she has one good
copy from dad so she's not going to be
affected but then we have the case of a
male if they have a son well dad's going
to give down a why but mom could give
either the X with the unaffected early
or the X with the affected allele and if
she gives the exit with the affected
allele then we're going to have an
affected individual so you have to
combine the probability that mom can
pass on the affected x which is one-half
and the probability that they're going
to have a boy or the probability that
dad is going to pass down the Y which is
another one half and one half times one
half is equal to one-fourth or
twenty-five percent and that would be
the answer to this middle question here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
