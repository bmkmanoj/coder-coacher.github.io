that represents an algorithm of the sort
I just described after the last quiz so
here's the basic idea just see if you
can picture this we have in the middle
of this process we have some theta at
some time step T and we're simply going
to generate samples that are consistent
with that distribution so we're going to
treat our probability distribution is
not just something that gives us a
probability but something from which we
can sample so generate samples according
to pea-soup theta sub t generate a bunch
of those samples and now that we have
these samples we're going to come up
with a new theta t plus 1 and that theta
t plus 1 is going to be the best samples
that we just generated so let's say the
top half now you'll notice that this
should actually remind you of something
does it remind you of any other
randomized algorithms that we've looked
at so far maybe a little bit like
simulated annealing no because it does
you know change the probability of going
up where we're choosing oh we'll choose
anything for a percentile that's a lot
like genetic algorithms right this is
Aguilar genetic algorithm except instead
of having this population that moves
from one bit to the other we generate
samples that's like our population so we
generate a population here we pick the
most fit of that population by retaining
only those that are the best ones and
all the stuff that you said before about
well maybe you don't want to pick the
best ones maybe you want to sample it
according to a probability distribution
proportional to the fitness all those
things you talked about before would
apply here but let's just stick to the
simple case where you you take the best
ones and now that we've got this new
population rather than using that
population again we estimate a new
distribution that's consistent with
those and then we just lather rinse
repeat until we come to some convergence
okay so let me just make sure I'm
following first of all when you say
pea-soup you don't mean the food I do
not because I do not like you soup and
you don't mean soup meaning like the
largest possible value of theta because
when I was hearing pea soup theta I was
I kept thinking that you meant the best
theta no soup is short for super script
script
people so P sub I which means subscript
yeah okay that makes sense and okay so
now that that's another that's we are
the this notion of estimating
probability distribution I guess that's
where it feels really fuzzy to me
because if you do the estimate as a kind
of I don't know sort of particle filter
II kind of thing where you just keep
instances then it feels really a lot
like to genetic algorithm right except
remember one of the things that we cared
about was structure so this structure
that we're maintaining remember this
this complaint that I had that we
weren't somehow keeping track of
structure in a nice way
yeah is all going to be hidden inside
the how we represent these probability
distributions that is going to be the
structure that moves from time step to
time step rather than just the
population of points moving from time
step to time step and I'll get into some
details about that in the very next
slide I just want to make sure that you
understand the high-level bit here the
high-level bit I mean I'm not I'm not
yet connecting it with theta in the
sense of the previous slide
ah so theta is our threshold right so
basically we have some distribution now
remember what is P superscript theta it
is you know it is a probability
distribution that is uniform over all
points that are have a fitness value
that is greater than theta greater than
or equal to theta right so I have some
distribution here if I generate samples
from that distribution then what this
means is I'm going to be generating all
the points whose value whose Fitness is
at least as good as theta and then I'm
going to take from those the set of
points that are much higher than theta
hopefully and use that to estimate a new
distribution and I'm just going to keep
doing that and what should happen is
since I'm constantly taking the best of
those is that theta over time will get
higher and higher and higher and I'll
move from theta min over time to theta
Max and when I get to theta max I've
converged and I'm done
I see so alright so the theta trace so I
guess I was confused because I didn't
completely absorb the second line yet so
that we're updating the theta and it's
specifically going to be tracking the
I'm not sure what the enth percentile is
so given the number of samples that we
draw oh no I'm sorry
int means you know 50th percentile or
25th percentile or 75th percentile so
okay so if you set that to be the median
which is the 50th percentile then what
we're doing is we're
sampling we're taking the top half of
what's left we're somehow refitting a
distribution to that set of individuals
that were drawn and repeating in the
sense that now the fitness of those
individuals the median should be higher
because we're sampling from kind of a
more fit collection right that's exactly
right
okay so this should work or at least it
should match your intuition that would
work if there are sort of two things
that are true the first is that we can
actually do this estimate yeah that's
the part that scares me
uh-huh sure well given a finite set of
data can we estimate a probability
distribution so that's the first thing
that sort of had better be true and the
second thing that needs to be true and
this is I think a bit more subtle is
that a probability distribution for a
piece of theta and a probability
distribution for say p sub theta plus
epsilon that is a slightly higher value
of theta should be kind of close so
another one what does that mean what
that means is that generating samples
from p sub theta t should give me
samples from p sub theta of t plus one
so i have to that that means that not
only do i have to be able to estimate
the distribution i have to be do a good
enough job of estimating this
distribution such that when i generate
samples from it i will also generate
samples from the next distribution that
i'm looking for okay okay so if those
things are true then I hope you can at
least sort of imagine that you would be
able to move from the part of the space
that's a theta min and eventually get to
the part of the space at theta max yeah
it seems like it should climb right up
yeah I agree with that I just assuming
that you can represent these
distributions in between again the
picture that I have in my head is like a
bumpy mountainous landscape and you put
a slice through it and in the beginning
yeah right so in the beginning it's the
whole space and that should be easy to
represent at the end it's a single point
and that's easy to represent but in the
middle yeah like that but in the middle
it's this sort of crazy there's a blob
then there's a space then there's more
blob there's little blob of the hole in
it so like that might be a much harder
distribution to represent right and
that's going to turn out to be an
empirical question but as I hope you'll
see in a couple of slides it tends to
work out pretty well in practice okay
and by the way
when it doesn't work out well in
practice there's all these cute tricks
that you can do to make it work out
pretty well in practice and we'll talk
about that towards the end okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
