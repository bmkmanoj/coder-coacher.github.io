procedure for cleaning data now the
specifics are going to vary from one
situation to another but the overall
process remains the same here we're
going to go through this blueprint or
procedure and then immediately following
this discussion we'll look at a concrete
example
following this blueprint so the first
step is to audit your data now in this
step what you'll be doing is
programmatically checking the data using
some validation rules you've written and
you'll create a report on the quality of
the data now you might also want to run
a statistical analysis in order to for
example check for outliers having run
your audit then you use that information
to create a data cleaning plan in our
data cleaning plan we want to identify
any causes of the dirty data that we're
seeing now this is going to be very
situation specific then we're going to
define a set of operations that will
correct our data again
situation-specific and finally what you
want to do is run a few tests to make
sure that your data cleaning plan is
going to do what you need it to do next
we're going to execute the plan now just
to be clear this is essentially running
a script that will execute that set of
operations you defined in the data
cleaning plan now it's possible in fact
it's likely that we won't have been able
to programmatically clean our data
entirely and if it's necessary for you
to do so there may be a manual
correction step where you go through or
you hire someone to go through and make
any changes that need a human eye in
order to correct the data now again this
is another process where we have humans
involved so once we've gone through all
this it makes a lot of sense in my
opinion
to iterate on this possibly more than
two iterations until you have confidence
in your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
