great work if you found those two now if
you struggle with this I recommend going
back to looking at completing the square
you'll need this as a helpful tool for
many of the types of problems you'll
encounter later we want to start by
subtracting 6 from both sides of the
equation so we'll have negative 6 on the
right and then we'll have our x squared
term and 6x on the left and our y
squared term and negative 2y also on the
left I'm moving my constant term to the
right and I'm regrouping the X terms
together and the y terms together we'll
add 9 to our X terms and we'll add that
to both sides of our equation we add
nine since B over 2 squared equals 9 b
is 6 we divided by 2 which equals three
and we square it to get 9 to complete
the square for the y terms will add one
to both sides of the equation the be
here is negative 2 so negative 2 divided
by 2 equals negative 1 and then will
square it which equals positive 1 so
these three terms can be written as the
perfect square of X plus 3 squared and
these three terms can be written as the
perfect square of Y minus 1 squared and
then on the right hand side we simply
add these constants together to get a
total of four now our equation is in the
form we recognize we have h which is
negative 3 and we have k which is
positive 1 and then our radius is simply
the square root of this number it's too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
