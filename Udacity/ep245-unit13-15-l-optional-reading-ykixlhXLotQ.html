business model canvas and customer
development there's some optional
reading for the next lecture take a look
at business model generation pages 86
through 111 and pages 135 to 145 and the
startup owner's manual take a look at
pages 51 284 down market size and then
take a look at pages 188 199 and pages
457 to 459 also take a look at the links
below on for additional readings that
don't require any of the textbooks so
that's the reading but what should you
really be doing if you want to build the
start up before the next lecture well
what we want you to do is start working
on identifying your market size your
total available market and what's your
target market and then we want you to
think about what kind of experiments
would you want to use to test your value
proposition customer segments channel
and revenue model how would you go out
about doing this not just talking to
people but what would you ask them and
what would be a pass/fail signal for
each test some examples for the next
class are available on the link below
the other thing you need to be doing or
the most important thing you need to be
doing in between lectures is talking to
customers and if you're not talking to
at least 10 potential customers between
these lectures you're really not going
to have enough mass enough data to
actually get some insights well you
could say well I've talked to three but
you know there's no magic number but it
just turns out that you want to data set
large enough that you can actually get
not only the mainstream thought but some
of the outliers where some of the
interesting answers are so the other
thing is after you talk to customers you
want to every week update your business
model canvas with what you learned which
hypotheses were wrong in which we're
right and optionally if you're using the
launchpad central software post your
first discovery narratives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
