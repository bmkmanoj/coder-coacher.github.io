want to D transformations where we
basically have a matrix m to give us
values of any point B to give a point P
Prime let's look at what we would do to
get something simple less translation so
what we want to do for translation is of
course we would have the axes for x and
y and we want to translate it into a
different location again from this and x
and y so this has been translated let's
say for a lack of better words by an
amount DX and dy okay how would we
represent this in this new homogeneous
coordinate system well again this is
what we are interested in XY prime X
prime Y prime 1 X Y and of course now
let's think about what m will be by just
looking at this you notice that we can
actually construct it diagonal terms are
all ones and the these two axes could
just be TX and dy and if you actually do
the math you less basically notice that
what we will come up with would be is X
prime is going to be equal to X plus t x
and y prime would be equal to y plus dy
that gives us what we wanted so
translation is easily modeled this way
what about scale again here the goal is
to go from this image to a larger image
in this case again what we did before
the same two by two we had looked at
before with SX and sy can go into these
two values here and of course the rest
of it will work out because what will
happen is x prime x sx x will be the
result and that's exactly what so this
gives me a nice three by three matrix
for being able to doing things like
scaling what about rotation in rotation
basically I want to take an image and
being able to kind of rotate it around
where basically how I need to know
things like theta and here the theta
would be this value here right and we
know how to do this again we know when
if somebody gave me a theta I can
compute using this cosine theta minus
sine theta just in this two by two and
again these are 0 0 1 would give me x
prime x
Prime and we know how to do this to the
good thing with homogeneous coordinate
system is these two parameters help us
do things like even model translations
we can also do share the same way start
with an image we want to share it
remember this was when shear happened
like this and of course again we would
put the shears in the off diagonal terms
all the diagonals be beyond you can play
around with this yourself and these
matrix multiplies you can see it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
