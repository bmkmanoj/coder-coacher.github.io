about with regard to portfolio
optimizers and modern portfolio theory
consider these assets and also recognize
that for any particular return level
there is an optimal portfolio so let's
suppose we pick this return level and
that this is the optimal portfolio in
other words this portfolio reflects
weightings of all these assets that
provides the lowest risk for this
particular return now we can compute
this for all the potential returns from
the minimum return stock here up to the
maximum and if we did that for all of
them in fact there's an infinite number
of them so we couldn't really do it for
all of them you get a line so our
maximum return portfolio is up here and
it would consist entirely of that one
asset but as we bring the return down we
find a number of other portfolios all
the way down to here a couple different
things to observe that are interesting
one is is as you reduce the return
sometimes this curve comes back in this
direction indicating that actually the
risk is increasing as we reduce the
return so for the most part people don't
want those sorts of portfolios in other
words who wants a lower returning
portfolio with more risk so we typically
look only at portfolios above this line
as you might have guessed the name of
this line is the efficient frontier so
what does that mean the efficient
frontier well it means that there are
essentially no portfolio's out here and
that any portfolio that's on this side
of the frontier
it's suboptimal in some way so for
instance if you had a portfolio here you
are assuming this much risk for a lower
return than you could have if you were
up here on the frontier or if you were
targeting this much return you could be
over here with regard to risk so any
portfolio inside here is not efficient
because it's either higher risk or lower
return than
could be if we were on the efficient
frontier one last thing to mention about
the efficient frontier is if you draw a
tangent line from the origin to the
frontier where it hits is the max sharp
ratio portfolio for all of these assets
in practice the efficient frontier isn't
used for that much other than as a
theoretical device but people do often
like to plot the efficient frontier so
they can see where their portfolio is in
relation to the assets that they're
using and where they could be in terms
of efficiency okay that is all I will
see you online soon thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
