the lunch Exxon and this is pretty sort
of um this is kind of redundant bad code
but I wrote it quickly and I and then I
think it works so we have the lunch Exim
function and the first thing it does is
looks at the length of its argument but
is to say looks to the length of the
string over which it's going to compute
a checksum it's also going to initialize
to check some variable to be 0 now if
we're computing a checksum over an even
number of digits the remainder mod 2 is
going to come out to 0 so in this case
we're going to loop over the digits in
the checks on that is the range l is the
goes from 0 to the length minus 1 and
hear what I'm going to do is add one to
that number so that we can get a one
base numbering system like I showed you
in the explanation of lines algorithm so
here now if we're a digit zero in Python
we're a digit number one in the ones
based human numbering system and so if
that comes out to be 0 when modded with
two now we're at an even-numbered digit
so in that case we're going to add the
value of that digit into the sum
otherwise we're going to call this lund
is it function on the same value and the
lund is a function is just sort of the
obvious thing it multiplies the number
by two if it's greater than nine returns
nine less than the number otherwise this
returns the number so now the other case
is that we're check summing an odd
number of digits and in that case we
have exactly the same logic but with the
even and odd cases flipped around so
here we're taking the Python zero-based
digit adding one to it to get a human
ones based numbering system modeling
that with two if it comes out to be even
we're doing the lund is your computation
if it's odd then we're just adding in
the value of the number and finally we
get a checksum that we've accumulated
here and we take that mod 10 and that
gives us our actual check some value
that we're going to use so now here's
the algorithm for generating a valid
random credit card number so the inputs
are remember a prefix and a total length
and digits so the number of random
digits we're going to generate is the
total length minus the length of the
prefix minus one for the checksum digit
now we're just going to assert that
that's greater than zero just to be
careful and now we're going to set n is
our credit card number that's in
progress so we're going to initialize
that to be just the prefix now for the
number of random digits we have we're
just going to make up a random digit and
append it to the string finally we're
going to add a zero checks on to it and
could be at the lunch exon if that lunch
exilim comes out to be zero we're done
if that lunch exon comes out to be
nonzero we have to do the little
inversion that I talked about where we
take the checksum where we subtract the
checks on from 10 and now what this
little bit of logic does is strips off
the last character that's
zero we added from the credit card
number and ads on the checksum number so
that's how easy it is to generate a
valid credit card number and now the
Islam valid function just checks off the
loan check sum is 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
