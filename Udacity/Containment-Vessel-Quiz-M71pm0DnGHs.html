to use case number two which was the
having to do with the containment vessel
was not ready so our first use case asks
the question but the question might come
out negative in the last case we have a
contingency we have to have to deal with
so this is a variant on the on the first
use case so in order to get there the
the steps are that the quarry is sent to
the containment vessel if it is not
ready than a message must be sent to the
hot water source telling it to stop or
prevent the flow of water now what's
what's going on here is really a couple
things one is the start-up situation
where before we even start the we check
whether the pot is there but it could
also be the case that somebody pulls
that pot out too quickly okay and so in
that case it's not going to be ready
either in both of those situations we
want to make sure that the water doesn't
start pouring through we can extrapolate
and indicate that when the containment
vessel is returned to the the heating
plate another message is sent to the hot
water source enabling it to resume so
we're talking about 12 turn turn off the
hot water source and another one to turn
it back on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
