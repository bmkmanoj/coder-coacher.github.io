is doing is that it's returning the path
to the directory where our app is
located and this thing path for resource
is getting for us the path of the folder
where our mp3 file is alright so we're
about to use this file path to play
sound although there is this one thing
that is bothering me here which is what
if there is a problem getting this file
pad for instance what happens if we miss
type the name of the file or its
extension to avoid such cases it's good
to include this declaration in an if
statement there now if you are unable to
obtain this file path for whatever
reason we can print out a helpful error
message okay
so it's time to do step two in our
pseudocode which is to create an
instance of av audio player to do this I
will click on the help menu and then go
to documentation and here I can search
for AV audio player now I read through
this documentation and in here I found a
constructor that can help us make an
instance of av audio player it takes in
two arguments one of which is called URL
which is of type nsurl I think this is
the URL to our mp3 file
although nsurl seems new now at this
point I'm starting to wonder if the file
path in my code is also of this type so
I'm going to go back to my code and
check and here if I look in the
documentation for path for resource I
can see that it's returning a string and
not an nsurl so it seems I have to
convert the string to the type NS URL
and this is where you can help me can
you run a Google search to figure out
how to convert a string to NS URL here
are the details you will need one more
time our code currently returns a string
although we need an nsurl to create an
instance of av audio player can you
convert a string to an nsurl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
