tester all of the methods are actually
returning zeros let's fix the Amidala
speed up first right now it's returning
zero what if I just write it in sort of
the way it is now if I run the tester
again I'm getting an actual of two point
eight seven five when I expected one
point six I think I'd better go back and
fix it right now this is doing the
divisions first so one over s and s over
N and then the additions and
subtractions in the middle and there's
no real sense of the fraction that we
started with this whole piece from s to
n should stay together in the
denominator and the 1 minus s needs to
stay together in its numerator let's try
this again all right looks like I'm dull
speed up is working but we still need to
do the cross ratio I'll try doing this
sort of naively again I've written this
as it looks but flattened it onto one
line so if I return this quantity and I
compile I'm getting an error unexpected
type required class found value this
error probably doesn't make a whole lot
of sense to you yet but this is a little
hint of what's to come a pair of
parentheses like this immediately
followed by some other quantity has
another meaning in particular if you put
a type in here instead of an expression
like a minus C what I need to do is
indicate that I want to multiply and
I'll need to do it over here as well and
now if I try to run the tester again I'm
definitely not getting right answers for
the cross ratio this is because when we
have a bunch of operators with the same
precedence Java will just start from the
left and move to the right so instead of
computing a minus C times B minus D over
in parentheses B minus C times a minus D
this will do a minus C times B minus D
divided by B minus C and then multiply
that entire quantity by a minus D what I
need to do here is group the denominator
I could also group the numerator if I
really wanted to but it wouldn't make
much of a difference if I compile again
and run the tester I've now got two
methods working right now for the
average
I might try returning the sum of all of
these all divided by four let's see how
this works if I run the tester it looks
like it works in in one case but not in
the other let's look at this second case
I'm gonna go read inside of the tester
the case that isn't working is when we
try to take the average of three for
three and three we should in fact expect
3.25 but it looks like we're losing the
decimal Java is interpreting this as
integer division because 4 is an integer
and a b c and d are all declared as
integers there are a few ways I could
fix this I could write 4 as 4 point or
4.0 and then it would get the right
answer here or I could actually change
all of these instils and then I wouldn't
actually need to specify that the 4 was
a double I could compile this and run
the tester and it still works that's
because if any of these variables are a
double this whole expression in
parentheses is going to come out as a
double and a double divided by an int
doesn't need to be done with integer
division that calls for regular division
this is a really easy thing to mix up it
looks right to us but the computer is
going to read it wrong and the compiler
won't warn you when we ran this with all
intz and no doubles we saw that it ended
up being a runtime error this is a good
example of why it's helpful to think
about what you want your answer to be
before hand calculate a couple examples
and then write your code good work on
