and let's say that n is 4 so we have 4
values here in order from least to
greatest so if n is 4 the rank of this
value is 1 and the rank of this values 4
and the actual values are these so for
this one n divided by 2 would be 4
divided by 2 which is 2 X sub 2 is this
one is this the median no because since
it's an even data set the median is
going to be the average of these two but
now we know that this data value is X
and divided by 2 the rank n minus 1
divided by 2 would be 4 minus 1 which is
3 and then divided by 2 which is 1.5 and
that doesn't exist we don't have any
with a rank of a decimal value only
integer values what about this one we
have X sub n plus 2 plus X sub n plus 2
plus 1 so if this is the rank and
divided by 2 and divided by 2 plus 1 is
3 and then if we divide it by 2 we get
the average of these two values so here
we have our answer
and you see that this value is this
third one using this logic we can extend
these formulas for any even-numbered
data set ok let's say that n is 5 so we
have 5 values in order can we divide 5
by 2 no if n is odd then we can't have a
decimal rank what about 5 plus 1 divided
by 2
well that's 6 divided by 2 and 6 divided
by 2 is 3 so that means we would get the
value in the third rank and that is the
median let's still explore the others if
we have 5 minus 1 divided by 2 that
gives us 4 divided by 2 which is 2 and
the value and the second rank is not our
median and finally we have 5 divided by
2 which is 2 point 5 plus 1 which is 3
point 5
and again we don't have a value that's
ranked 3.5 only integer values this is
probably kind of confusing so before we
finish this solution let's just apply
this one to the Udacity ins Facebook
friend data set that we had before
remember we had 27 values so we want the
value in the n plus 1 over 2 place so if
we plug N in then we get 27 plus 1
divided by 2 which is 28 divided by 2
which is the 14th place and then when we
looked for that value in the 14th place
we found that the median was 479
hopefully that makes some sense in that
it's getting you more familiar with
using symbolic notation good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
