non-deterministic RAM on a ram because
that is what we originally set out to do
and it turns out it's actually not that
difficult once we have our deterministic
Ram simulator because what happens if
you are in a given line of code there's
two different things that can happen one
is it's a normal instruction such as one
you would find on a deterministic Ram
and in this case the simulator can just
go on running the same way that it would
have gone for the deterministic Ram the
only difference is if the simulator
encounters this if-better here then it
has a problem because then simulating
what this line of code does is not
straightforward anymore
the if-better might execute the first
part of the code or the second part of
the code around which it is written
so we have to work a little bit on this
part here of the simulation so we have
to distinguish two cases one is if we
have a normal instruction then we'll
just do a simulation but if we have an
if better then we don't know how the
machine continues so what our simulator
will then do is it will branch into two
different possibilities so it will start
two new simulations in one simulation it
will continue assuming that the if
better function executes the first part
of the code so the one that came
directly after the if-better and in the
other case it will continue assuming
that the if-better function executes the
second part of the code so the part that
comes after the else statement and of
course once you have this branching you
don't have one single simulation anymore
but you have to continue with two
simulations one simulation makes this
assumption here the other one makes this
assumption down here and if you now
encounter the if-better statement a
second time then again you will have to
branch into two possibilities up here
and the same thing down here if you
continue the simulation with the
assumption what happened the first time
you encounter the if-better function and
now you go on then again if you find if
better again you will have to split into
two different possibilities and of
course running a simulation this way
where you have to split into two
possibilities all the time comes
the price which I'm sure you can figure
out by now and my question to you is if
we have a program that uses the
if-better function n times how many
simulations or how many different
simulations do we end up running is it n
simulations is it N squared simulations
is it 2 to the power of n simulations or
something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
