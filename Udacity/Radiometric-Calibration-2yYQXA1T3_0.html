again we are interested in this pipeline
of going from L towards I but we also
want to be able to model the inverse
phenomena in a bit so let's start off
with a color chart that we know the
reflectance is off but basically means
is a color chart like this comes in
predefined and here basically just I'm
showing you the gray values here it
shows what are the intensities ninety
fifty nine point one percent so somebody
is sat down and calibrated this color
chart as a perfect color model or
grayscale values that we are interested
in what we want to do is we want to take
multiple exposures from this Kerr color
chart which basically means is I'm going
to take images of this what I can do of
course is I can take them at different
exposure values that basically means I
can you know do things like epsilon
photography I can take images at
different exposures shutter speeds and
all that kind of stuff that would of
course change how what kind of intensity
is for the same image that ours out
there of course we're basically playing
around on this parameter here of
different types of parameters to get to
this value I'm just showing you an
example of this so again my pixel values
go from 0 to 255 this is my scene
irradiance
I'm gonna look at irradiance because we
know our scene radians to radians is
linear things and actually we're more
interested in trying to get there this
mapping is something which is linear of
course when done we know what's going on
of course this basically means is now
everything's projected on a 2d surface
which of the information is coming from
so of course if I know the scene
irradiance I can plot a point as I go at
different senior radians and of course I
can figure out from this one what is the
intensity at each and every pixel so
next part that we can do now of course
is after I've drawn this curve for a
specific device or a sensor an imaging
device like the camera I've done this on
by taking in this case one image to
image three four five six seven images
and I can basically fill in the curve
now I can do the opposite right if I
know a pixel value around one am curious
about a pixel value can I actually now
compute the scene irradiance and that's
what this exercise basically shows once
I can model this I can always come back
and I say okay what's here I can
throughout the singing radians at this
point again senior radians here is going
from 0 to 1 now this will allow me to
pick up any values I want so of course
there are few assumptions here in when
we play around with images like this it
assumes constant lighting and all
patches basically are equally well lit
so it can't be a focused light source
the zooms of light source is really far
away and is equally lighting the whole
scene so you know for example something
like natural sunlight when you light
with this kind of stuff or a lot to do
this a unique in work exists for G
because in this case G is monotonic and
smooth for all types of cameras and
again we will model this for different
cameras and this allows us to compute
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
