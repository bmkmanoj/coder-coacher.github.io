functions to data like this I'm going to
show you the code of how to do that in
just a moment but I wanted to start with
sort of the result and then go back into
the code and show you how we did it so
our original polynomial is a blue line
it's under here you can't quite see it
and the noisy data are the green dots
there this purple line is our initial
guess and the fitted polynomial the red
line here fits the original pretty
closely so let me show you a little more
detail here is output from our program
this is our original polynomial it
prints it in kind of a weird way our
original polynomial is 1.5 X to the
fourth minus 10 X to the third minus 5 x
squared and so on and down here are the
results of our optimization so here's
what we got instead of 1.5 for the
fourth power we got 1.6 instead of
negative 10 for the third power we got
negative 10.5 and so on but overall
pretty close and as you can see by that
chart I just showed you you know very
nice fitting let's look now at how we
did that in code the code here for a
higher degree polynomial is very similar
to what we had for the line again
there's an error function we're trying
to minimize and we take in the
coefficients for the polynomial and the
actual data and our error function is
computed here again it's a sum of the
difference between the actual data and
the polynomial value squared we take the
sum of all those values and that's our
error so again very similar to what we
did for the line here's our function
that finds the coefficients of the
polynomial as just a few parameters the
data that we're trying to fit
our error function in other words how do
we measure error and what are we trying
to minimize and the degree of the
polynomial we create an initial guess in
other words what do we think the values
of the coefficients are and what we're
doing here is we're just setting them
all to be once we plot that and then we
call our minimizer just like before we
have to tell it what's the error
function we're trying to minimize
what's our initial guess we have to pass
along the data which then gets passed to
the error function and again this method
s LS QP and finally you can't see it
it's off to the side there but same
options
essentially the verbose options and
that's it that's how we use Python to
create a model based on data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
