interviewee I think she did she didn't
end job answering my questions she
definitely took her time thinking right
she she thought she didn't she didn't
feel rushed rushed trying to answer my
questions and that's very important
because it allowed me to to stay staying
connected with her I think she did an
excellent job with we ask me the
questions in general she she she went
straight to the answer she was very good
I think she was very good at explaining
what she was thinking and taking me with
her to the process of getting to the
answer which i think is very important
and there there are three things that
she did very well and the first one was
guiding me through her thought process
whenever asked her a question she would
not just rush in and start answering I I
I asked her a sequel question right and
she explained how she was exactly what
she was going to write before she even
started writing the board same with the
with a programming question she she told
Mike us all with she told me how it's
not the optimal solution we agreed that
it was a good enough solution she
started writing I think that those are
the the most important thing to do in a
technical interview and she was also
very clear with her she explained which
is something I said analyst you need to
be very good at and we look for I want
her to be able to explain things to
other people because it's a huge part of
her job the things that she could have
worked in a little bit more was
definitely being more familiar with the
machine learning algorithm that she
mentioned during the interview I think
another point where she might have be
able to improve a little bit is when
once she solved the programming question
when she went to work through examples
it was a little bit too fast it was kind
of hard for me to follow so maybe even
making a table of what a variable will
look like over a ation of the
for loop might help me be able to keep
keep obably what she was saying and stay
connected with her in general I think
she did a good interview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
