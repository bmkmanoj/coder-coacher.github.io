something may be failing occasionally
when collecting your data for example if
you were conducting a traditional
door-to-door survey maybe the person
handling the documents loses a few or
tends to miss some streets at random
because they don't know the geography of
your town very well this is a case of a
researcher or collection technique
causing missing data the offline example
of someone conducting a traditional
door-to-door survey can easily be
translated to the digital world
imagine your data collection software
fails one out of every thousand times or
you have a couple of service outages you
could have similar data loss if this
were to happen in our baseball player
data set we might see some missing
values here and there just because we
made some error in collecting them at
random another more harmful reason
values may be missing is referred to as
non-response in the case of non-response
a certain subset of people chooses not
to answer particular questions or don't
respond at all this can lead to biases
in your data and consequently false
conclusions in the case of baseball data
say we were interested in the batting
average of players maybe since there I
don't know self-conscious about their
batting average all outfielders just
don't provide a value this would make
our results inaccurate and lead us to
conclude that the average batting
average was 312 even though that is
based only on one data point here Derek
Jeter's the important point here is this
if a missing values from your data are
distributed at random your data may
still be representative of the
population
however if values are missing
systematically it could invalidate your
findings it's important to design your
experiment or data collection method to
minimize these effects beyond this it's
very important to check your data to see
if such effects are present</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
