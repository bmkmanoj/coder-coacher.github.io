devices look like let's talk about how
they and other i/o devices can be
connected to the system we usually
connect our devices using some sort of a
standardized IO bus it needs to have a
standard because we want to be able to
connect for example hard drives from one
manufacturer to a computer built by
another one and then possibly even
replace the hard drive with another one
from another manufacturer or even move
our existing hard drive from one system
to a new one we are buying so that we
can access our data without having to
spend a lot of time copying it because
these buses have standards they have a
limited rate of improvement and often
this improvement goes in steps so
although the technology might go up in a
relatively smooth fashion this is where
a new standard gets adopted by
manufacturers this is another one and so
on meanwhile this is where a new
standard gets adopted by manufacturers
or things suddenly improve but then for
a while you just have the same buses
even though the technology is actually
improving and instead of having just one
type of bus that connects to all io
devices typically we have a hierarchy of
buses you have a mezzanine bust such as
PCI Express it will be pretty fast and
short so that it can be dispensed and it
can be used to directly connect fast
devices to the processor such as for
example graphics then we will connect
storage buses to it for example the SATA
or skazhi for hard drives both of these
are used usually to connect storage
devices these are somewhat specialized
for storage and a SATA controller will
act as a PCI Express device on the
mezzanine bus but the controller itself
actually controls a SATA bus to which we
now connect devices so the reason why we
have these and don't directly connect
their hard drives to the PCI Express is
that although these for example serial
buses are slower there is also less
change in their standards and there need
not be that much change because these
devices are much slower than what the
PCI Express can provide so we don't
really need all the speed of PCI Express
in exchange we get to keep our hard
drive standards for a while longer while
PCI Express can improve a little bit
more rapidly all we have to do is
devised new controllers that connect
these storage buses to the newest PCI
Express that we have and then we can
have a USB hub for example also attached
to a pci express bus the USB hub itself
provides a USB bus connection for USB
devices that are even slower than for
example SATA but again they're standard
lives for a lot longer so we can use a
lot of different devices relatively
cheaply and connecting to this so
overall what we can have is a pci
express bus to which we can attach the
process or the graphics the i/o bus
control for disks for USB and these in
turn provide buses to which we can
attach disks here and all sorts of
devices here so the closer we get to the
processor the more important it is to
keep improving speeds because because
some of the devices like graphics need
that speed but for storage and for many
of the standard USB devices we really
are much more interested in
standardization so that we can exchange
this so that we can interchange these
devices and not have them tied to a
particular technology and have to change
them every year or two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
