great on a bunch of different screen
resolutions and different sizes and even
better it doesn't detract from the
overall theme of your app how would you
use it so here's a small app that I did
to show you the different type of
graphical sizes that are available in
Android and their names now right now
they're all using the Roboto font let's
go and change that so here's the app
that we were just looking at so if you
want to add your own font the first
thing that you'll need to do is add an
assets directory under source main and
we've included our font which is
courgette regular it was just a font
that I found on Google web fonts because
most of them are available with
open-source licenses so if we switch
over to the Android view it'll show up
as assets and res directory but those
are the same location so you might see
one one or the other depending on how
you set up your Android studio if you're
using your font inside of a fragment due
to the fragment life cycle you need to
instantiate the typeface in the unattach
method the reason for this is there's a
short period of time after a fragment is
created but before it's attached to a
host activity so if you can see in this
typeface create from asset function we
have get activity and then get assets if
this is called before it's attached to
the activity it will result in an error
so if we go to our uncreate method after
instantiating our text views we just
call the set typeface function with the
object that we just created so if we
look at this on a device we can see that
our display for and our headline view
have changed so this is our display for
here and then if we scroll up a bit
right here is our headline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
