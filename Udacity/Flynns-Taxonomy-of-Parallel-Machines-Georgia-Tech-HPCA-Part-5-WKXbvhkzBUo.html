taxonomy of parallel machines it
distinguishes parallel machines
according to how many instruction
streams they have and how many data
streams these instructions operate on
the first type of machine is single
instruction single data or sis d and
logically this type of a machine
executes one instruction stream and each
instruction operates on one data stream
this is really your normal unit
processor so if we have for example a
single core machine that's what it is
the next type of machine is single
instruction multiple data so it takes
Acutes one instruction stream meaning
there is one program with a single
program counter we go through but there
is more than one data stream they
operate on the most common example of
this used to be so called vector
processors which execute a program but
each instruction instead of operating on
normal scalar values operates on vectors
so for example you can execute an add
instruction but it operates on two
source and one destination vector of
things so it operates on many many data
items at a time modern processors also
have these multimedia extension
instructions such as MMX or SSE 1-2-3
and they are also an example of limited
sim D where a single multimedia
instruction will operate on maybe four
or eight data items then you can have a
multiple instruction single data stream
this is weird because we have multiple
instruction streams so there are several
different programs executing at the same
time all operating on the same stream of
data so it's not used much and the
closest we get to this is something like
a stream processor where you have the
first processor operating on for example
the raw data from the camera and then
that data moves on to the next processor
which is going to process it some
further like find the edges or sharpen
it or something and so on but even there
it's not truly that we have a single day
because the output of the first
processor is not the same as the raw
camera feed so this is just kind of the
closest we get to it but really MISD is
not really used much and then we have MI
MD where there is more than one
instruction stream and more than one
data stream and this would be your
normal multiprocessor where each
processor has its own program that it's
running with its own program counter and
so on and each of them operates on its
own data so they don't have to do things
in lockstep to operate on the data and
they don't do something like a stream
processing so this type of processor
really includes most of the processors
you can buy today because most
processors today are multi-core which
means really they have several processor
cores each of which executes its own
instruction stream and can access data
independently so it has multiple data
streams and this lesson is mostly about
this type of machines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
