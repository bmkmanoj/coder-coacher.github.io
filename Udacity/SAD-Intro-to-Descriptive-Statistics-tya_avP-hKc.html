you're just depressed during the winter
for some people this is an actual
recognize disorder called seasonal
affective disorder this applies to any
season throughout most of the year
people with sa D have normal mental
health but experience depression during
certain seasons even spring or summer
researchers tried to figure out how to
treat sa D ninety-five people were
randomly assigned to one of three
conditions bright light therapy which is
where participants were exposed to
10,000 Lux for 30 minutes every morning
from 6 o'clock until 6:30 a.m. Lux is
the international standard measurement
of illuminance the second group received
on simulation which was a dawn signal in
which people were exposed to Lux that
peaked at 250 and this lasted 1.5 hours
and the third was a placebo condition
which was just 1.5 hours of a dim red
light at only 0.5 Lux this lasted from
4:30 a.m. until 6 a.m. the number of
people in each group was as follows 33
in the bright light therapy 31 in the
dawn simulation and 31 in the placebo
after six weeks all the subjects were
blindly rated by a psychiatrist so the
psychiatrist did not know which
treatment each person was exposed to the
psychiatrist used the structured
interview guide for the Hamilton
depression rating for seasonal affective
disorder this measures a person's level
of this type of depression on a scale of
0 to 89 with higher numbers indicating
greater severity of depression the
researchers found that Dawn's simulation
was associated with greater recovery
that is compared to the placebo group
and the bright light therapy group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
