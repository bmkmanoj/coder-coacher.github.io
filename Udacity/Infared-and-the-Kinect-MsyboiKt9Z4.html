using infrared structured light all
right and infrared structure light one
of the nice things about it is you and I
can't see it so it's doing all this
stuff out there but it's not sort of
interfering with our vision and the main
reason that I our structure light has
become so big is because of this puppy
right here the Microsoft Kinect all
right kudos to my friends and colleagues
in in England and Cambridge who helped
take the technology and it was the 3d
technology i'll tell you about was
actually developed by primeSense which
was an Israeli company and then
Microsoft leveraged it in a way to go
from the depth to recovering skeleton
which is a whole other interesting piece
of work that we won't talk about here
but if we did it in machine learning
since they use machine learning methods
for doing it we could talk more about
doing that but the Kinect is really I
mean it was a hundred and fifty dollars
so all of a sudden you could put depth
sensors on little experimental robots
for very little money so how does the
kinect work well it's not public all
right so there are people who know
exactly how it connect works people from
primeSense etc but it's not public lots
and lots of this stuff is known but the
exact implementations are not known the
primeSense patents described at least
two ways and i will tell you about both
of those ways conventional wisdom is
that one of the ways is actually used in
the kinect and one is not I don't really
care they're both kind of interesting so
the two methods that they use are one is
a very very clever optics trick in fact
it's so clever I don't totally
understand exactly how it works because
I have to get more in the detail but
essentially it projects a pattern with
two different kinds of lenses and we'll
talk more about in a minute that allows
you to go directly from the image to the
debt explained that and then the much
more standard way which is just like
light striping is that you're
essentially using something about the
projected image from the projection of a
particular pattern in what it's observed
like and they're in the other camera so
you're about to see some drawings that
look kind of funky they don't look like
you know the high quality drawings that
Megan always insists that I use
but that's because these are actually
taken directly from the patent and the
patent applications I think it's cool to
just see those so the key to the connect
sorry the key to the primeSense focus
method are these cylindrical lenses so
cylindrical lens is if you take two of
them you have one that goes one way and
I think on the next thing you have one
goes the other way you end up with this
funny situation where you have different
focal lengths depending upon which way
you move so you have a one focal length
horizontally and a different focal
length vertically and of course slightly
different focal lengths as you were to
sort of rotate around what this allows
them to do is to project out speckles
and they now what happens when a dot is
out of focus well in a normal lens right
it becomes a blurry circle when you have
one of these what are called a somatic
race isometric lenses it becomes an
ellipse because the lenses are different
in one direction than they are in
another direction and what's cool about
the way they did this geometry and this
is the part that I'd have to work
through the map more to understand is
that depending upon the depth so here
the hand is at onesie and here is that
another Z again these are from the
patent these ellipses well they have
different thickness but more importantly
they have different orientations so you
can just take a look at the orientation
in a little local area of these little
dots that are been smeared and the
orientation tells you the depth this is
really really cool but I think it's so
cool that they probably don't use it
because i think it's requires some
pretty precise lensing and some other
things i'm not not really short but this
is the one method of how the kinect
works and if you go in there hat and
you'll see figures that talk about like
this that you capture this test image
and then you find the range based upon
the pattern orientation and then you
build this 3d map although you notice
this says based on offsets between test
and reference pattern so that's the
method i'm about to tell you here is the
one that just talks about the the
orientation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
