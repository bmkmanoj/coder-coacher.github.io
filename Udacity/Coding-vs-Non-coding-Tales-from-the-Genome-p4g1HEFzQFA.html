genome actually counts as coding for
anything there are more than 20,000
genes in just that 2% now we refer to
this major division in the genome as
protein coding DNA and non-coding DNA
now the rest of this lesson will
actually continue to cover how this 2%
of our genome
still codes for all those proteins the
next lesson will actually start to
reveal some more about the role of this
98% of non-coding DNA to make sure that
your understanding of non-coding and
protein coding DNA sequences is clear
I've listed five different types of
sequence that we could find in a genome
we have exons introns promoter regions
translated sequence between start and
stop codons and untranslated sequence
that would be transcribed but outside
start and stop codons I want you to
indicate which sequences in this list
here which sequences of DNA would be
considered either coding or non-coding
so we're gonna use the number one to
represent coding and two to represent
non-coding so in each box I want you to
put even the number one or the number
two to indicate whether an exon would be
considered part of coding or non-coding
sequence go ahead and pick which answer
you think is best
for each item in the list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
