experiences weight force of about ten
Newtons on the surface of the earth but
for space travel we need to know more
what's going to happen if it doubled the
distance between our mass and the center
of the earth for instance what's going
to happen if it double the distance
between our mass at the center of the
earth obviously the force is shrinking
but by which vector it turns out that as
we double the distance we have only one
quarter of the force if it tripled the
distance the force goes down to 1/9
which means that in our equation for the
force of gravity we have to have a
distance squared in the denominator if
you use twice the mass we should have
twice the force so the mass appears in
the numerator and if our masses are
created equal the mass of the earth
should have the same role so the mass of
the earth two should appear in the
numerator from the units of measurement
you can see that this doesn't work out
so far kilograms squared divided by
meters squared that doesn't look like
force there's a universal constant
appearing in front the constant of
gravity which is six point six seven
times ten to the minus eleven Newton's
times square meters over kilograms
squared these units are pretty much of
human scale Newton's meters kilograms
and you see that gravity seems to be
pretty small on these scales the force
exerted by two masses of one kilogram
each in a distance of one meter for to
mount to six point six seven times ten
to the minus eleven Newtons a pretty
small force this is why we need
something as big as a planet to see
gravity in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
