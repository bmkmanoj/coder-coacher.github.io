you see what I meant when I said that
hardness of a problem can be measured as
both a function of the size of the input
and the structure of the input so in the
case of vertex cover it so it turns out
that what makes solving vertex cover
hard is actually the size of the vertex
cover itself so if there's a small
vertex cover then the problem is easy
and if it's large then the problem
becomes hard now of course this
immediately raises a question for the
book of the laws of NP completeness and
that question is is every problem fixed
parameter tractable that depends it
depends on what you consider as a
parameter and one parameter I will soon
introduce to you as well is a parameter
called distance from triviality but
unfortunately in general not every
np-complete problem seems to be fixed
parameter tractable so for vertex cover
we have just shown that if you use the
size of the solution as a parameter then
yes this problem is fixed parameter
tractable using K and by K I mean the
size of the solution of course now what
about clique and independent set and
again we can consider these two problems
together because they're so similar and
here unfortunately have a bit of bad
news for you because using K by which I
mean the size of the solution that's
highly unlikely to be fixed parameter
tractable so by highly unlikely what I
mean is it would not be something as
similar as P equals NP or something like
that but so there's evidence in a way
that is similar to P versus NP that
clique and independent set are not fixed
parameter tractable at least if you
consider the parameter to be the size of
an optimal solution
now what about shortest tour well one
possible parameter here would be using D
the size of a shortest tour and here
again it seems somewhat unlikely that
the problem is fixed parameter tractable
but for shouldest where another
parameter has been investigated that
actually seems rather promising and that
parameter is called using distance from
triviality and there it turns out
shortest tour actually could be fixed
parameter tractable now what is distance
from triviality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
