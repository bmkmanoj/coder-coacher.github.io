timing quiz the final question was when
does the ad here the last instruction
commit to do that we have to figure out
what happens with the last two
instructions so can we issue the
subtract in cycle five yes we can only
one of the add subtract reservation
stations is used at that time in cycle
five it actually will be freed so from
cycle 6 we actually have all the
reservation stations in ads attract
available but for sure one is available
in cycle 5 and then the third one we can
use it in cycle 6 in fact by that time
this one is also available so we can
just issue these instructions the
subtract here uses r 2 and r 5 r 5 is
not produced by any of the previous
instructions but r 2 is so we actually
have to wait until cycle 7 before we can
proceed to execution now because in
cycle seven other instructions are also
beginning execution we have to figure
out can we actually run this subtract
now or do we have to wait for the next
cycle so we want to run it in cycle
seven but remember this is a
multiplication this is a subtract so
they're using different execution units
and they can begin in the same cycle if
another for example add or subtract was
beginning at seven then we would
actually have to wait until eight but
because these are different units we can
begin at seven and we're going to try to
broadcast a result at eight nobody else
is trying to broadcast at eight so we
will succeed at that and finally for the
ad here it's waiting for r 4 and r 3 r 4
is produced by the subtract r 3 is
produced here so we need to wait for
cycles 5 and date and then begin in
cycle 9 we will try to broadcast in
cycle 10 and now the question is when do
they commit remember that we can commit
up to two instructions per cycle so
what's going to happen is in cycle 10 we
are going to also try to commit the
subtract we are only committing this
multiplication so far we can commit to
instructions we will try to commit the
next instruction so in cycle 10 we will
actually commit this and now
interestingly enough this ad is done
just in time to try to commit it in
cycle 11 so it's going to commit in
cycle 11
so the final answer for the final part
of the quest is that the committee's
happening in cycle 11 here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
