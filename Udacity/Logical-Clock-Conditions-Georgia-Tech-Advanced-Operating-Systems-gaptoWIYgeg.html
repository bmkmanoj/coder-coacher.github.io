conditions for the logical clock
proposed by Lamport first of all the
first condition is that if I have two
events a and B in the same process the
first condition says that the clock
value associated or the time stamp that
is associated with event a has to be
less than the time stamp associated with
event B or in other words we have this
counter or a logical clock on every node
of the distributed system that is
monotonically increasing as events
happen on that process
the second condition is that when we
have a receipt of a message we want to
make sure that the receipt of the
message has a timestamp that is greater
for sure than the sending timestamp so
in other words if a and D are the act of
sending a message from process I and D
is the act of receiving the same message
on process J then what we are saying is
that timestamp associated with the event
a has to be less than the timestamp that
is associated with the event D in other
words we want to choose the timestamp
associated with D as the max of the
timestamp that I see in the incoming
message incremented by some value
whatever the local counter is saying so
these are the two things that I'm going
to look at and decide the max of that as
the timestamp to associate with this
event D and if the events are concurrent
in this case if I look at this picture
here is the act of sending the message D
is the act of receiving the same message
B is an independent event that's
happening on process P I it has nothing
to do with this event D that is
happening on process PJ and these are
concurrent events so the concurrent
events we've already seen this when we
talked about the happen before
relationship in the case of concurrent
events that time stamps are arbitrary
just by looking at the time stamp I
cannot say that B happened before D
because if I see the time stamp
associated with B here happens to be
four over here
we picked the time stamp for D by saying
that it has to be at least greater
the incoming timestamp so we give it a
timestamp of three and so if I look at
these two events B and D D has a
timestamp that is smaller than B but
that does not mean that D happened
before B because these two are
concurrent events and therefore there's
no way to know which event happened
before the other so in other words just
because we find that there is a an event
X which has a timestamp that is smaller
than the timestamp associated with
another event Y doesn't mean that X
happened before Y so while this
condition is important condition the
condition that if an event a happened
before B as we show in this picture we
have to ensure that the timestamp
associated with event a is less than the
timestamp associated with the event B
but the converse is not true or in other
words if I have two events and it so
happens that the timestamp associated
with this event X is less than the
timestamp associated with this event Y
that does not mean that X happened
before Y this is very very important
what that means is that lamport's
logical clock gives us a partial order
of events happening the entire
distributed system so if I take any one
process I know all the events the
ordering of all the events that happened
on this process both the events that
happened sequentially in this process
itself as well as events that happened
in which this process happened to
communicate with other processes in this
case it sends a message over here
similarly by looking at the record of
all the events accumulated on process PJ
I can know the order in which the events
happened in this process in which
process PJ had a part to play meaning
all the local events as well as
communication events that PJ
participated in when it communicated
with other nodes in the entire
distributed system this is what the
lamport's logical clock gives you is a
partial order of all the events that
happened in the distributed system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
