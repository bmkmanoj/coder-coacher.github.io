several different components we'll be
looking at how each of these components
interact with each other as we work
through this lesson but it's helpful to
see roughly how they all fit together
before diving into the specifics of each
one the first thing we'll look at is the
module component think of a module as a
container that stores the different
parts of an app like any framework
angular provides a template format the
HTML structure of your application this
is the view part of the MVC framework
architecture that angular follows the
controller is where you set up the
initial state and logic for a view the
scope is what binds the template in the
controller together when a user
interacts with the template and changes
some of the data the scope watches for
this change and updates the controller
on the flip side if the data changes in
the controller then the template is
updated directives are markers on a
template that tells the angular HTML
compiler to attach special behavior to a
Dom element a service is closely tied
with controllers you would put view
independent logic in a service then you
can use that service in many different
controllers for example a service could
be used to fetch and store a user object
this one service could then be used in
multiple different controllers an
angular app doesn't need a router but
the more complicated and app gets the
more likely it is that you'll want one
to help manage the application state a
router will watch the URL and load the
correct template in controller let's
take a look at how to add angular to an
existing project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
