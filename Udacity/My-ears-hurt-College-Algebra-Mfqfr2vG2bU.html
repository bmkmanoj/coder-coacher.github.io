answer to this question to be in minutes
but the time that we have up here is
eight hours so let's convert that to
minutes to start off so eight hours
times sixty minutes in one hour gives us
four hundred eighty minutes great so
this is the exposure time for an 85
decibels sound we want to know what this
is for 100 decibels though so let's
think about this last piece of
information if the exposure time before
damage is cut in half every time the
power doubles we need to think about how
many times the power doubles from 85
decibels to 100 decibels we knew before
that it was five times so if power
doubles five times that means that our
exposure time is halved five times so we
need to take 480 minutes and multiply it
by one-half five times that doesn't seem
too bad however we know that if we want
to multiply it by one-half five times
that's the same as multiplying by
one-half to the fifth power one-half to
the fifth is one over 32 so we're
actually dividing 480 x 32 and that
gives us a final answer of 15 minutes
now remember that every time power
doubles we have a decibel increase of
three some sources say that instead of
the exposure time being cut in half for
every 3 decibels its happens every 5
decibels but I think it's better that we
err on the safe side I bet you never
guessed that we would end up talking
about your health by the end of this
course but that just goes to show you
how incredibly applicable algebra is in
all spheres of life in just this lesson
we've talked about everything from sound
to carbon dating dead sea scrolls in the
population of the world and this all
happened in just a few questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
