meaning that speakers of the language
will understand we could define words as
just what's in the dictionary and then
there would be a clear answer for that
but certainly there are lots of things
that are words that aren't in the
dictionary and the important thing about
words is we have rules for making new
words for example we have a rule that
says if we have a word we can make a new
word by adding counter in front of the
old word I'm using the same notation
that we used back in unit 1 this is the
BNF replacement grammar if you need a
refresher on this please go back to the
video that introduced that in unit 1 but
the basic property is that we can
replace what's on the left side with
what's on the right side so anytime we
have a word we can replace it with
counter word and the meaning of the new
word is something that goes against the
original word so if we started with the
word intelligence and I mean this in the
sense of spycraft not in terms of smarts
well then we can use the rule we could
make the word counter intelligence
intelligence was a word we added counter
in front of it to make counter
intelligence and that means trying to
thwart intelligence from the enemy we
can use the rule again so now this is a
word and we could replace this word with
counter in front of that word and we get
counter counter intelligence and that
would be trying to thwart the enemy's
counter intelligence that's preventing
you from getting intelligence and we
could keep doing that we could have
counter counter counter intelligence and
so forth and these are words that once
we get up to at least three counters
it's not something that's used before
but it's still something that has a
sensible meaning and we could do this
further words so we saw that one of the
very long words was this hippo Potamus
monstrous sicko follow bia and if you
knew that this word meant fear of long
words and even if you've never seen the
word counter in front of that before so
now we can make the new word counter
hippo
Pato monstrously Peter Hawley phobia
quite a mouthful but even though you've
never seen that word before and I expect
most of you have never seen that word
before well you could guess that this is
something that goes against the fear of
long words maybe there's some new
medication that cures people of this
phobia and you could also figure out
well if there was a counter counter
hippo and so forth phobia well that
would be something that counteracts the
counter hippo and that might be
something where this new drug doesn't
work if you have too much coffee then
coffee would be a counter counter hippo
so forth phobia so the point is because
English has this rule that allows us to
make new words from old words there's no
such thing as the longest word we can
always make a longer word starting from
any word that we have if you remember
how BNF grammars work then you should be
able to answer the next quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
