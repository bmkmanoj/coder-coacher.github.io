quick example l1 is TS and its
compartment has these three categories a
B and C L to a secret with a B and l3 is
secret also with BCD as the categories
so does l1 dominate l2 TS is dominates s
and a B C contains a be so we said that
each or l1 to dominate L to the
sensitivity level has to be greater
which is the case and its compartment
has to contain the compartment of l2
which is the case so this is yes does l2
is less than l1 yes the same reasoning
we did it's less because this is less
than T s and this is contained in that
how about l1 and l3 as we know is TS is
higher than s so when you look at the
first part just the sensitivity level
that's a total order so this is greater
than this but b c d is not contained in
ABC ok so there's this element d that's
not content here and because this is not
contained here then l1 is not greater
than L 3 similarly l3 is not greater
than l1 and the two are not equal
because the compartments are different
and the sensitive level different so
when we in either one dominates the
other one and they're not equal then
they cannot be compared which is the
third case that we're talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
