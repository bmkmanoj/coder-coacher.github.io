up all the values and then we're taking
the absolute value since these are all
positive taking the absolute value won't
do anything it'll already be positive
but this has nothing about the
deviations in fact this will just be the
mean again this one says that you're
finding that absolute deviation so
you're taking a value minus the mean
which are these deviations but then
taking the absolute value of them here
adding them all up with the Sigma and
then dividing by n the total number
which in this case is 10 so this one
does describe what you did this one says
that you're finding each deviation sure
here you're taking the absolute value
which are here you're dividing each of
these by n which in this case is 10 and
then you're adding all of them up which
will give you the same thing
as if you first added all of these up
and then divided by 10 so this one also
describes what you did this one looks
like it's going the opposite direction
so instead we're taking the mean and
then subtracting each of these values so
we would get the opposite of each of
these we would get positive 19 thousand
574 this would also be positive but
these would be negative but then it says
we take the absolute value which will
lead us right back to this column here
because it doesn't matter if these are
negative or positive then we divide by n
and we get the same thing as this this
one says that we're just using one data
value we don't know which one it is
subtracting the mean taking the absolute
value and then dividing by n which
doesn't give us what we want this was
very tricky but the more you work with
formulas the more comfortable you'll get
with them and don't worry by the end of
this course you're really going to
understand all of these symbols and
formulas that we're using and it'll
really help you in expressing
mathematical ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
