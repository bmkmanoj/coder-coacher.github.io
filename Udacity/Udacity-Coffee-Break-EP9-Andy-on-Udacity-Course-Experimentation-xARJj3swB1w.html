and welcome to a diocese coffee break my
trumpet Udacity is the lead instructor
and that means I get to think about a
lot of interesting things but among
those things are you nasty score
structure I right now Udacity courses
all look pretty much the same series of
videos and questions and this is good
because it lets you think or forces you
to think of the content you're learning
which is a good thing but it's not ideal
because right now let's say I'm an
experienced programmer which I'm not and
I won't learn something about Java I
could take the intro java class right
now and it would contain all the
information that I need to learn but I
don't have to sit through a lot of
information that I already know and
that's not the best use of my time
likewise if I'm a rookie programmer and
I want to no html5 I could sit in that
class but it would be way over my head
and so I've been thinking or we've been
thinking Udacity live I have solved that
problem how can we make it so that your
time that you spent Udacity is best
suited for you you're always learning
and it's a really hard question I
suspect that the ideal course experience
will be nonlinear and by that I mean not
everyone is going to see the same series
of videos and questions it shouldn't
sell might be personalized but I'm not
sure should the student be making those
personalization decisions deciding what
paths to go down or should it be somehow
automated i'm not sure and we're testing
a lot of these things i'm really excited
to keep thinking about what the idea of
course experience is and i'd love to
hear any ideas that you have thanks for
