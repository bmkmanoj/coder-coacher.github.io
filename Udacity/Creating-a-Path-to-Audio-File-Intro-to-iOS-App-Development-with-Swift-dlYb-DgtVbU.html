right and the first step therein is to
create a path to an audio file now I
will need a V Foundation to work with
audio so what I've done is imported that
framework at the top of my code here
then I found an mp3 file of the movie
quote I actually want to play from my
app this file currently resides on my
desktop by the way it's also available
for you to download in the instructor
notes to add this to our app what I will
do is go back to Xcode click on the file
menu and then click on add files to
pitch-perfect and then simply add the
mp3 file make sure this copy items if
needed box is checked ok so now if you
look in the navigator we've added the
movie quote file to our project I can
drag it into the supporting files folder
alright now that I have the mp3 file
added to my project I can get a handle
on it inside viewdidload using the
following piece of code by the way this
code is also available in the instructor
notes for you to use so at this point I
want you to use the option key on your
keyboard and try and figure out what
these things called NS bundle main
bundle and path for resource are doing
here is your question one more time
enter your response in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
