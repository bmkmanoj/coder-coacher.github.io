to talk about how to be a good citizen
on the internet there are two key things
you can do when you're writing programs
to manipulate other people's websites or
to access other people's websites that
will make everybody's life a lot easier
one is use a good user agent remember we
talked about in unit 1 user agents are
the header that described what what
browser you're using or what program
you're using to access somebody if
you're planning and accessing somebody
in a consistent fashion if you're going
to pull them you know every couple of
seconds for updates or do something like
that use a good user agent when you're
using URL lib to you can specify headers
in your request and you should set a
user agent header that says you know who
you are what your name is maybe links to
your website so that's somebody on the
other end if they see you you know
pounding them with lots and lots
requests they know they know what's up
they have a way of reaching you to ask
you to stop or to tell you they blocked
you or that sort of thing it's good to
always include that and the other really
important thing is it's the rate limit
yourself if you want to download let's
say all of the search results for the
word Udacity on Twitter yeah you can you
can request them 15 at a time which is
what their API returns I believe as fast
as you can but you'd be really sending a
lot of requests to Twitter because you
can have some loop and it's much much
faster than any human could type it and
that would actually hurt Twitter servers
if you were to have code like this and
Python you know well there's more stuff
make another request to Twitter and just
run this in this infinite loop or maybe
not infinite loop but loop that's going
to run through a number of iterations
you'll be centering requests as fast as
Twitter could possibly serve them
instead it's a really good at to get in
the habit of using the sleep function in
Python you can say import time time dot
sleep 1 and this will cause your
interpreter to sleep for one second and
this is nice then you're only hitting
them once a second which is much more
sustainable but if you abuse their
service or do too many requests they'll
probably rate limit you I know Twitter
does because I thought about having a
quiz in this in this unit that was how
many requests in a minute can you make
before Twitter rate limits you but then
I realized that that would be the exact
opposite of being a good citizen on the
net asking thousands of students to go
hit some website as fast as you can is
generally not a nice thing to do so
instead we're just going to talk about
it i'm going to ask you to make sure if
you're hitting somebody hard that you
structure your code like this include
asleep so you pause a little bit and
don't hit anybody too hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
