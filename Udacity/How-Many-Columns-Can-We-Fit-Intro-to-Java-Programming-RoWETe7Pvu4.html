will be 2 and in each even row will be 1
this is because the width is 1900 so if
we start from all the way on the edge we
can fit 800 plus another 800 is 1600 but
not another 800 which would give us
2,400 so that calculation was 1900 over
800 and then we lost the decimal in the
even row we had to subtract 400 from
1900 because we can't use this first 400
meters then we can fit eight hundred and
at this point we're at 1200 and if we
add another 800 we would be at 2,000 but
that's more than 1,900 so that wouldn't
fit so that calculation was nineteen
hundred minus four hundred over 800 and
then we dropped the decimal let's write
an equation for this write it down and
skip if you know the rest to calculate
the number of columns per odd row we
calculated the width which was nineteen
hundred divided by the diameter which
was eight hundred and then dropped the
decimal to calculate the number of
columns per even row we started with the
width subtracted the radius or four
hundred divided by the diameter and then
again tossed the decimal write this down
you're going to want it for later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
