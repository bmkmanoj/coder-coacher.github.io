Alan with us here Alan describe some
problems when you're first working with
the framework what did you experience
when you're first learning a framework
there's a lot of overhead that you need
to learn that that's specific to the
framework I mean it's not just like
learning a language like take take for
example angularjs right even if you are
an expert in JavaScript you can't start
off right off the bat developing angler
jas there's some nuances or caveats are
things that are done differently within
those different frameworks like for
example angularjs has you know different
modules factories it's interesting like
for some frameworks in order to print
you know hello world to display on a web
page you need multiple lines of code
whereas like if you're just dealing with
straight HTML CSS and JavaScript it's
pretty simple to do so for students that
are just starting out into the world of
frameworks and trying to learn their
first one what would be some advice
you'd give them I would say first and
foremost you need to be very comfortable
with the language each each frame or
kind of ships are usually ships with
their own DSL or domain specific
language but if you don't understand the
base language you're incurring a lot of
technical debt professionally as well as
personally as far as advice to extend
generally to any framework and students
jumping into it another thing I would
recommend is definitely do not be afraid
to jump into the documentation
especially your mainstream or large
largely supported frameworks the
documentation is excellent take for
example angularjs or Ruby on Rails you
should you should have that bookmark and
always always visit it I mean different
documentation is good then most of your
questions will be answered there so
you've worked with a couple of
frameworks from learning your first one
what was it like transitioning to a new
one a good question so when you're
transitioning frameworks you you don't
lose all the knowledge that you gained
from learning that initial framework and
part of the value of learning frameworks
is that a lot of the best practices are
kind of built in if not if not forced on
you over with configuration or with
convention rather and so you're able to
be able to translate a lot of those best
practices to other frameworks or even if
you don't have a framework
you can you can build your application
with some of those best practices that
you learn from a previous frameworks
okay so learning your first framework
might be a little tough but then the
slide is a lot easier for learning a new
one yeah there's a lot of design
patterns that are common throughout
frameworks for example MVC model view
controller that's something that exists
across most of our front-end frameworks
or or full sack remarks okay so learning
your first one might be a big push but
then after that then it's a lot easier
to switch to a new one and learn a
different style sharing work every firm
works different they all have their
different nuances and caveats but the
general themes and best practices are
pretty consistent across all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
