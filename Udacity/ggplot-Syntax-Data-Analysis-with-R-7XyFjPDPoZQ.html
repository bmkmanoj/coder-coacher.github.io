scatterplot this time we're gonna start
by switching from the Q plot syntax to
the more formal and verbose ggplot
syntax I mentioned this in lesson 3
the ggplot syntax will let us specify
more complicated plots so just as a
reminder this is the Q plot syntax in
order to create this scatter plot ggplot
is another plotting function similar to
Q plot and it has slightly different
syntax here's the equivalent code to
produce this scatter plot the main
difference between Q plot and GG plot is
that we have to say what type of giome
or chart type that we want in this case
we want a scatter plot so we're going to
use the giome you can see the full list
of chart types in the GG plot reference
which is linked in the instructor notes
the second big difference between the
two plotting functions is that GG plot
uses this aes wrapper we have to wrap
our x and y variables inside this
aesthetic wrapper don't worry about this
too much we'll cover this in more depth
later now I want to get some ranges on
my age so I'm gonna run the summary
command on edge to figure out the lower
and upper limits the minimum of the age
of a user is 13 and the maximum is a
hundred and thirteen now let's clip the
x-axis at age 90 and at age 13 this
seems reasonable since users who are
younger than 13 are not permitted to use
Facebook and we're really not that
confident whether people who report
being older than age 90 are telling the
truth to do this we're gonna use the x
lim layer now i'm not going to pass x
limb into ggplot instead i'm gonna use
it as an additional air outside of it
notice that we use the plus operator to
add a new layer to our figure and this
is going to change the appearance of our
x-axis I really recommend that you add
one layer at a time when building up
plots this allows you to debug and find
any broken code and there we go there's
a nicer plot with our users ranging from
13 to 90 years old</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
