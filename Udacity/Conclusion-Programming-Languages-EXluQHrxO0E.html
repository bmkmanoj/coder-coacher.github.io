interpreters and formal semantics and we
touched briefly on the halting problem
surprisingly although the halting
problem is officially impossible to
solve it's actually one of my favorite
areas in computer science the halting
problem and its cousin Rice's theorem
are sometimes informally known as the
law of interpreter writer employability
because it's officially impossible to
solve all of these problems and get them
right every time there's always a market
for people who can make close
approximations or be almost right be
right most of the time be right with
high probability we know it's impossible
to do absolutely correctly but nothing
stops us from being 99.999 percent
correct so we keep trying with closer
and closer approximations in fact a few
years ago with a student I was trying to
do just that we wanted to look at a
program source code and guess which
lines were likely to be executed
frequently without actually running the
program if we could solve this formally
we could definitely solve the halting
problem so we know it's impossible but
we can solve it for a subset of programs
or be often right you might imagine
looking at the recursive definition for
Fibonacci if you're calling Fibonacci of
10 the recursive call happens much much
much more frequently than the base case
that just returns one is there some way
we can look at how humans write programs
and figure out what's common based on
that it turns out we were able to
extract this sort of structural
information or comments that are present
in human written programs and figure out
for them which lines are more or less
likely to be executed or executed more
or less frequently at runtime so even
though the problem is impossible to
solve in practice we actually view this
as an opportunity because it's not
possible to get it exactly right we want
to come as close as we can and reach for
the stars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
