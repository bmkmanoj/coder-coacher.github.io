first 22 months FML i was in the US team
and built a large part of the apt exists
currently today and and now i'm on the
strategy team we're focused on exploring
different monetization strategies FML
FML iOS team decided to rewrite the mail
app and Swift around the same time as WC
2015 Swift to was just announced and we
were watching all these videos about all
the cool things you can do it Swift i'm
at the same time quintessentially our
product design teams were discussing new
UI in New you x's in the dental appt
also at the same time our existing
objective-c Cody's was becoming very own
maintainable building features of
staying a long time and if we ever want
to take do any design changes to the app
or flows like different flows in the up
it would require like massively factors
because of the fact that our UI layers
or model layers are soaked PP coupled
together so one day after one of the WTC
sessions always came back to the San
Francisco office and started
whiteboarding like what of switched
version of my mom looks like we like
make an API layer like you like making
you wear and we just don't like open up
the computers and started building it
this wasn't like an official project or
anything but we started we kept doing
this for about a week and a half and
came up with the bare-bones version of
the dental appt kind of just like
experiment Mike sialic Swift only
version of my lap feels and how much
faster we think we can iterate on a
virtual like this as opposed to the
current events the app we got to a very
good . those two weeks and finally like
told product bike working on and how
like this is coby that's gonna be
maintainable for a very long time and
it's also going to enable us to write
features much faster and because of all
that they decided like cardboard and we
started building this app objective-c
will stick around for a very very very
long time
all of you like it foundation and I
think all the performers actually
written and not 100-percent objective-c
I don't think she's gonna go anywhere
for an extremely long time I think that
having some knowledge about how it works
is extremely important
um I do think that as time goes on more
objectively developers will be writing
Swift more often a lot of existing
companies that have a hundred percent
ejects the apps will start catching the
substrate and like start building all
the new features and switch i highly
recommend um why don't recommend is just
rewriting a nap perfectly good and
jealousy in his left because it's gonna
be a very very very long project with
very little game one of the largest
challenge of doing a baby right is the
fact that during that time of the
rewrite Europe your team can't can't
really build new product features and if
you are building your product features
you have to build it twice once them to
existing up as well as like a menu up
the nice thing is that when you build it
twice you can actually see how much
faster you're building a new app which
is quite delightful and kind of proves
your point like the rest of the team
that this is a good decision but that
was definitely the most difficult part
about doing this you're right that when
we we were being conservative on new
features in the developed during this
time and that the ones that absolutely
had to get in and rewritten full times
we're still working on it today it's
almost done
the scope of the app is also changed a
lot since we first started that said the
entire teams working on it and whenever
like some project has come up like a
product feature that needs to come out
come up one of us what kind like move
off the rack or a pre right app and
start working on that project and then
we're going twice once for the bill that
wants to continue happen if we were
hiring a new developer at the mill who
primarily be writing Swift I think that
dunk having some objective c knowledge
coming in to the note would be really
valuable to us and it would also
differentiate them from other candidates
that might only ones left which is
really important though our entire code
base will be 100-percent Swift we do
have a lot of dependencies that are
objective-c and sometimes you do have to
go into them and like maintain them we
would want them to know the syntax of
jealousy primarily as well as some of
the nuances of tennessee for example
like objective-c variables are by
default always optional that mean that
opens you up to a lot of like errors and
one time one time bugs which you don't
have in Swift and so it's important to
be even more careful and check for now
before you're adding a variable into a
dictionary a lot of our third party
dependencies are still interested to see
some of which we've open sourced self so
going back into those dependencies and
updating things is important so knowing
basically Jackie syntax is very
important know you kind of do and no
ability on it to make sure that IQ
swiftcode plays nice with the Tennessee
is also very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
