code and if you wrote some more tests
you may start to have some more
confidence in the code that we have or
also considered efficiency to some
degree and it seems like there's a big
problem with the efficiency of the
program we have so far let me show you
one of the issues now we represented
States as a here they are T triplet and
the problem with this is there can be
two states that have identical here and
theirs but differ in the T and they're
going to be considered different states
now why is that a problem consider this
problem we have two people one who takes
one unit to cross the bridge and one who
takes a thousand now it seems pretty
clear there's an easy solution the two
of them go across together and it takes
a thousand but look how we're going to
explore this space we're gonna start out
in the initial state that took time zero
and then we're gonna start adding things
to the frontier and out of all the ways
we could cross the one that adds the
least is for the one to go across by
himself and now he's on the other side
with the one on the other side and the
thousand on the original slide and that
only took one step and now what's the
fastest thing we can do after that well
we can take one more step and go back to
the original state so here we had one
and we'll say we'll call K for the
thousand on the left-hand side here
K was left behind and one went over to
the right here we took one more time
unit and we had one and K on this side
and if we continue taking the fastest
step we can we'll get to another
distinct state where K is on this side
and one is on the other side and the
flashlights I was going with the one so
we keep on going on like that we'll go
out a thousand different steps and each
of these will be a distinct state
because this will be the state with with
time T equals zero here time T equals
one T equals 2 T equals three but really
although it looks like we're getting
different states in another way of
looking at it we're always getting the
same state we
going back and forth from here to there
and back to here and back and back we're
going around in circles
so in order to recognize that these are
in fact the same States we're gonna have
to take T out of our state and we're
gonna have to deal with the T someplace
else so we want our representation of a
state to be just here and there and we
got to figure out someplace else to put
the T and I'm not sure what the right
way to do it is but why don't we do it
this way we have a path which is state
action state dot keeps on alternating
between states and actions let's change
that so that the path is a state
followed by a tuple of the action and
the total time it took after applying
that action then the next state and then
the next action and the total time after
applying that and so on so that'll be
our our new representation states are
going to look like that and pass are
going to look like that now I want you
to write the new successor function for
the bridge problem so we'll call it B
successors to the two just to keep it
distinct from the first version and
again it returns a dect of state action
pairs a state and now is just a 2-tuple
of here and there and the here and there
are still frozen sets so it's pretty
much the same except we dropped out the
time T go ahead and implement that for
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
