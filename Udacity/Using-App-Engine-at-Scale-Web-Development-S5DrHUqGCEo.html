talking about scaling and basically a
hundred and one uses of memcache now a
lot of the things that we talked about
scaling you know adding new app servers
and adding more mem caches and scaling
the DB you know horizontally and through
sharding App Engine does for you and
have you guys have you guys been taking
advantage of those features has that
worked out for you in production
absolutely
the auto scaling is probably the the
best feature of it it works really
smoothly it's very transparent and you
know and our traffic definitely has
peaks and valleys you know as you know
there's been a lot of press and that
brings a lot of traffic and we've course
launches there's a lot of traffic it's a
lot of traffic is as you know homework
deadlines come up things like that and
and we can handle that without thinking
about it some of the you know I wasn't
there but I've heard some stories from
the early classes and the early a I kind
of you know the the prototype you know
from the fall and Mike pretty much was
spinning up servers non-stop you know
and he didn't sleep for a couple of
weeks he was doing nothing but spinning
up new new virtuals and we don't have to
do that we don't have to think about it
you know in it and we just you know
check each day to see how many instances
we have running there was a time where
we accidentally DDoS ourselves with a
bug that was sending way too many
requests back to the server some Ajax
requests and when we spun up to a couple
hundred instances you know and and
everything was fine our users were still
able to continue and you know every site
that's you know learning how to scale
has made that mistake and but you know
most of those other sites took
themselves down for day well they really
figured out what was going on and we
were able to figure out what's going on
without going down and so I think that
was just won't you know an instance of
you know kind of proof or it really does
work well cool it's funny to me that you
mentioned on App Engine you know
checking how many app servers you have
in the morning because I'm Reddit and
Hipmunk that's a number we were really
familiar with you know adding a new app
server is something we do deliberately
and
and especially holidays with reddit
something with a lot of deliberation
beforehand you know how is this gonna
fit in the architecture I was going to
change things you know with regard to
caching why not and an app engine you
know you're working in a different you
have to kind of develop things in a
different style as a result of this
nature and I wonder if you could comment
on kind of how App Engine was designed
and how it kind of fits the way you've
done things in the past it's really
become clear to me in my time that I've
been working with it that it was
designed by people that had been through
that several times and with different
kinds of apps because the solutions and
the things that they provide you kind of
has that those characteristics of if you
were building you know something over
again just the way you do it like if for
example the you know queueing can get
really complex and they're the queuing
system you know you create a task you
give it some properties the properties
that they give you that you can kind of
tune are exactly the ones that you'd
want to tune and then and the trigger is
just a simple like a web hook callback
and so the worker logic is just like any
other you know request Handler and it's
it's just very simple you know kind of
like the least kind of a common
denominator sort of mentality so trying
to just simplify things is definitely
something that really comes to mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
