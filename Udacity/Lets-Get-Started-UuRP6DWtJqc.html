machine learning is and what it can do
we've covered how to evaluate whether or
not you're ready and what you're going
to cover over the next several months
now it's time to get started in the
introduction of this nanodegree we're
going to cover some of the big picture
ideas and machine learning you're going
to hear from Charles's Bell michael
wittmann's machine learning class you're
gonna hear from sebastian thrun xin
turreted machine learning class you'll
hear from ashok oil in my knowledge
based artificial intelligence class
these are all materials meant to give
you a big picture view of that what
machine learning is and what it can do
and that's really the learning goal for
this particular unit of this nano degree
program you don't yet need to worry
about how you do machine learning you
need to start off with an understanding
of what machine learning actually can do
so try and focus on what machine
learning can do in these first few
