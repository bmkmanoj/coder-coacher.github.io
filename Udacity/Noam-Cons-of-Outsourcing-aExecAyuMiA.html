outsourcing your job is low quality of
work it happens a lot of times you're
just asking someone to do to do
something and this is not what i asked
for all this is in such low quality how
how possibly can you think that i'm
going to accept is this job another
thing is that they charge you more money
than they should they said that they
walked on this project for 50 hours but
you know that it never to them more than
five hours like what seriously and they
can be not responsive do not answering
emails are not answering your instant
messages in time the slack world is
empty and basically a lot of the stuff
that can happen when you remotely walk
with employees it's not that different
but it's kind of more annoying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
