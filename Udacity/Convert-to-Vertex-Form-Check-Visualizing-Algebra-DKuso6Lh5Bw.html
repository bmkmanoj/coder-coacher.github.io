the vertex is at 2 comma 1 good thinking
if you found these two now this one was
pretty tough especially since we had a
negative 3 here let's work through it
together our goal is to get a perfect
square so that way we can put this
equation in vertex form so we're going
to try and complete the square by adding
some amount to our polynomial I can't
quite complete the score yet since I
have a factor of negative 3 in front of
the x squared we want this coefficient
to be a 1 this means we can factor are
negative 3 from these two terms leaving
us with negative 3 times x squared minus
4x we can quickly check to make sure
that if we distribute we would get back
with what we started with we'd have a
negative 3x squared here and negative 3
times negative 4x which is positive 12x
now we're ready to complete the square
the B term is negative 4 so be divided
by 2 equals negative 2 and B divided by
2 squared equals 4 we simply square this
number so we need to add 4 in order to
complete the square for this trinomial
but we didn't just add 4 here we really
added negative 12 4 times negative 3
again think about distributing this
negative 3 to each of the three terms
and we would wind up with this
expression now we can't just go adding
numbers two equations and changing them
at random instead we need to keep things
balanced if we subtract 12 from an
equation then that means we need to add
12 to the equation as well this makes
the equation balanced it makes it to
that way it's not changed we know this
since negative 12 and positive 12 sum to
zero so we're just changing what this
equation looks like but it's really the
same exact equation now that we're here
we're ready to write our perfect square
the perfect square for this trinomial is
X minus 2 if we square this amount will
get this expression our negative 3 stays
in front as the coefficient and then we
have negative 11 plus 12 on the
if we combine the like terms on the end
we get a positive one here this gives us
our equation in vertex form and finally
for the vertex we have an H value of
positive two and a k value of positive
one setting the binomial equal to 0
gives us the x-coordinate of our vertex
and the K value or the y-coordinate of
our vertex is just positive one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
