yep okay what's the answer do you know
the value of the whole game no I wanted
to know the matrix okay so right so if a
goes left it doesn't matter what B does
and at that point there's a chance node
and it's 50 54 and negative 20 which I
feel like got to be negative 8 oh that's
right how did you get negative 8 cuz
half a 2 is 7 half of 4 is 2 and half of
negative 20 is negative 10 so negative 8
right so you just took the expectation
of where you would end up exactly okay
what next and that it doesn't matter
what B does so the negative 8 is also in
the upper right corner of the matrix
fair enough
the next easy one to do is if both go
right if a goes right and B goes right
then we get the 3 it's just sitting
there mm-hmm
and the last thing requires me to do
some multiplication so or negative 5
times 0.8 is like negative 4 mm-hmm
10 times 0.2 is like 2 so negative 2
that is correct Michael shoot yeah so
now we have the matrix now what have we
just notice here remember what I said
about matrices before it has all the
information that you need right
so in fact none of this matters who
cares how we got weight so here's the
thing we cannot reconstruct that tree
from this matrix we can't reconstruct
well actually we could reconstruct that
tree from there
no we can't we could no we can't yes we
can't be there's an infinite number of
trees we could do and one of them is
that one I see
we just don't happen to know that it's
the right one I don't think that's
really what people mean when they say I
can reconstruct this like I could
reconstruct the the crime at this crime
scene it could be any of a million
things like no we can't construct that
specific tree but you know what it
doesn't matter because the only thing
that matters is the matrix and you will
notice Michael that you did all that
multiplication and you multiplied 0.8
times 5 and after a couple of seconds of
thinking about it which was probably
edited out but I know how long it took
you to do you came up with the right
answer that's great
but notice that the number you came up
with doesn't say anything about expected
values and what the probabilities are
it doesn't even matter that it's non
deterministic because once you have
these numbers these expected values
that's what you're going to end up with
so who cares what the original tree was
who cares if you can reconstruct it who
cares where the rules of the games are
all you know is I have a choice of two
strategies we called them left and right
here but we could have called them 1 &amp;amp; 2
or Q and Z it doesn't matter for the
purpose of solving the game so what is
the solution for the game by the way Oh
a is trying to maximize right yes so a
would never ever ever ever want to go
left mm-hmm so it's gonna go right and
then B is trying to minimize so B is
gonna go left and we get the minus 2 I
believe that is correct and it makes
sense the other way as well right that B
would not ever choose to go right
because then a would choose to go right
as well
gotcha so you'll still end up here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
