each other's results through shared and
global memory this means they can work
together on a computation but there's a
problem what if a thread tries to read a
result before another thread has had a
chance to compute or write it this means
we need synchronization threads need to
synchronize with each other to avoid
this situation this need for
synchronization is really one of the
most fundamental problems in parallel
computing now the simplest form of
synchronization is called a barrier a
barrier is a point in the program where
all the threads stop and wait when all
the threads have reached the barrier
they can proceed on to the rest of the
code let's illustrate this here's some
threads and they're all proceeding along
through the code I'll draw them in
different colors and I'm also drawing
them different lengths so that you get
the idea that there there are different
places in the code there are different
points in their execution of the program
the idea is that when they reach the
barrier they're going to stop and wait
for all the others to catch up so am i
drawing the red one reaches the barrier
first and stops and the meantime the
blue one is proceeding along and the
green one is proceeding along and
eventually the blue one arrives of the
barrier and stops and the green one is
the last to arrive at the barrier and
stops and now all three threads in my
example say I only had three threads now
that all all the threads have arrived at
the barrier then they're all free to go
again and so they'll all proceed again
and we don't actually know which one's
going to go first
it might be that the blue one is the
first out of the gate maybe Green is
next
maybe red is last so let's look at some
code to illustrate this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
