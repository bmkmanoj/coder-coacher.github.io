often hear people say the three V's
volume refers to the size of the data
you're dealing with variety refers to
the fact the data is often coming from a
lot of different sources in different
formats and velocity refers the speed at
which it's being generated in the speed
at which it needs to be made available
for processing so let's look in more
detail at each of these let's start with
volume the price to store data has
dropped incredibly over the last 60
years in 1980 the cost per gigabyte was
several hundred thousand dollars in 2013
it's merely ten cents although it's
worth saying to actually store the data
reliably you're going to end up paying
more than that that's particularly the
case with more traditional storage
devices such as storage area networks or
sand which can be extremely expensive
the high cost of reliable storage puts a
cap on the amount of data companies can
practically store at some point they say
ok it's too expensive to store all that
data and I'm not doing anything with it
let's just store the critical stuff like
my actual sales but it turns out as
you'll see that the data you're
currently throwing away can be
incredibly useful what we need is a
cheaper way to store it reliably and of
course storing the data is only part of
the equation you also need to be able to
read and process it efficiently storing
a terabyte of data on a SAN is not that
hard but streaming the data from the
sand across the network to say some
central processor it can take a long
time and processing commute extremely
slow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
