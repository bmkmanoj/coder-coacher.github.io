very hard to do to bugging in the test
case these are very large and or
nonsensical that's what I mean here is
that the random test case that triggers
a failure in the software it's some
software under test might be many
megabytes long and it may have no sort
of usable human interpretation and into
those cases debugging the software under
test can be really hard there's a
solution to this there's there's a
pretty good solution to this problem
that we'll talk about a little bit later
so a final disadvantage of random
testing is that every fuzzer the final
disadvantage of random testing is that
people's experience is that every time
you write a new pfizer it finds
different bugs and what this basically
means is little incidental design
decisions in a random test case
generator Explorer subtly different
parts of the system under tests input
domain and that results in finding
different bugs on this so this shouldn't
be a surprise given the dream difficulty
of the testing problem but it's still a
little bit demoralizing when you spend a
lot of time writing a buzzer it finds a
lot of bugs and you think the system is
getting pretty robust and then somebody
else writes a really simple fuzzer and
it finds a whole bunch of bugs that you
couldn't find and this is this is very
common for that to actually happen so
that's a long list of drawbacks and
these drawbacks are real let's go back
and look at the other side of the
trade-offs so in the advantage side
random testing has less tester bias
meaning that testing is less influenced
by what I know about the systems
implementation and random testing also
has weaker of otha I also has weaker
hypotheses about where bugs are maybe
that's just another way to say the same
thing so besides this issue of bias and
hypotheses perhaps the real killer
advantage of random testing is once you
implement a random tester and once you
automate the testing process the human
cost of random testing is basically zero
and so this has certainly been the case
with his c compiler fuzzing effort that
i've mentioned several times where we
spent a really spent a long time
developing this random tester we worked
really hard on it but since we more or
less finished it up a couple of years
ago it's been finding on average a bug
or two a week in real compilers with
almost no effort from us so we have a
machine sitting in dark room somewhere
that's doing random testing but it's
running by itself it needs almost no
oversight all we have to do is look at
the results and write up some bug
reports and this process of turning
random tests into bug reports is
something that will come back to a
little bit later so in extremely
interesting and useful thing about
random testers is that they often
surprise us I've had the personal
experience of being surprised by random
testers many times and also in the
course of reporting about 450 compiler
bugs I found the compiler developers are
often really quite surprised about the
behavior of their tool so random testing
sort of consistently has this ability to
tell us something that we didn't
that's extremely valuable I don't know
their advantages that every buzzer finds
different bugs and so of course I
included that under disadvantages as
well is it sort of depressing at some
level but on the other hand this is
really cool so it means if we have
several fuzz tools might as well just
devote a couple of course to each of
them and more than likely there's not
even going to be that much overlap in
the bugs found by the different random
tester and finally do perhaps to some
combination of these other advantages I
at least find random testing to be
really fun it's fun to have stuff
automated it's fun to be surprised about
the system it's fun to have shortcomings
in our logic pointed out five process
that doesn't have a human involved it's
really just interesting to have this
happen and what's really just
interesting that this kind of stuff
happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
