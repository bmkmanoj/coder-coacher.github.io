you Michael so it turns out that theorem
that we wrote down before is still true
in the case of non-deterministic games
oh cool of perfect information right by
the way do you know whose theorem this
is Charles's theorem no although that
would be cool
find no Hemans theorem yes this is von
Neumann stare oh really
yeah man he's responsible for everything
do you know what you're gonna remind
everyone who's on the women is he's my
uncle
no no you're right you're right von
ointment so we talked about von Neumann
architecture in computer science that
the basic design of a microprocessor is
still following the ideas that that he
worked out right the von Neumann machine
so there you go so this is pretty good
right so what we did so what do we learn
so far what we learned so far is the
only thing that matters is the matrix
and once you have the matrix you use
minimax at least if you're in a two
player zero-sum game of perfect
information at least if you're in a
world of two player zero-sum games of
perfect information we can just write
down this matrix throw everything else
away and use mini max or maximun and
figure out what the value of the game is
which is the same thing as saying as we
know what the policy is the kind of
joint policy in a world where everyone
is being rational and trying to maximize
their rewards and assumes everyone else
is doing the same that's pretty cool
I think awesome so though you know I
feel like I could make a matrix that
wouldn't have this property this maxi
min equals minimax and and that we
couldn't make a tree out of it you
probably could but I'm gonna guess that
it's gonna require that it's no longer
zero-sum no I'm gonna say no to that
well you know what actually now that I
think I understand what you mean and the
answer is yes you could and in fact
that's what we're gonna do next when we
relax the next little bit oh so would
you like to do that sure though I'm
afraid if we get too relaxed we might
just fall asleep in fact why don't we do
that when we take a nap and then come
the joy of being on videos asynchronous
napping done okay I'll see you in a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
