the number into the product of other
numbers 216 can be written as 2 x 108
this number is even so i know i can
divide by 2 then I just continue my
process to get all the other factors 108
breaks down into two x 54 and 54 breaks
down into two x 27 27 isn't divisible by
two but it is divisible by three so we
have 3 times 9 is 27 and then 9 is 3
times 3 these factors are the prime
factors because the numbers only have
two distinct factors one in itself the
only factor of two is two and one and
the only factor of three is three and
one we can rewrite 216 using bases and
exponents we know we have two to the
third power since we have three twos and
we have three to the third power since
we have three threes this is the prime
factorization for 216 since the only
numbers that appear here are prime
factors use what you know about prime
factors to figure out what's the prime
factorization for 192 you can write your
answer in this box and be sure to
include the appropriate basis and
exponents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
