available for the stub that is on the
client side and the server side through
the subcontract mechanism the first
interface of course is for marshaling
and on marshalling so the client side
stub has to marshal the arguments from
the client and in order to do that it
has calls that it can make on the
subcontract saying that marshal these
arguments for me the subcontract will do
that for you depending on whether this
invocation is going to go to a server
that is on the network or is it on the
same machine or is it on a different
processor on the same machine all of
those details are buried in the
subcontract and therefore when the
client stub wants to marshal the
arguments for a particular invocation it
just calls the subcontract and says
please marshal these arguments for me
and the subcontract knows the way in
which this particular invocation is
going to be handled and so it can then
do the appropriate thing for marshaling
the arguments based on where the
location of the server is that's the
beauty of the subcontract mechanism and
this is true on the server side as well
as on the client side and once the
marshaling has been done the client side
can make the invocation and when it
makes the invocation once again the
subcontract says I know exactly where
this particular invocation is going to
go to so it takes care of that
so the subcontract on the client side
has this invocation mechanism obviously
because the client is the guy that is
going to make the invocation on the
server side the subcontract gives a
different set of mechanisms it allows
the server to revoke a service or it
allows a server to tell the subcontract
that yes I'm open for business by saying
I'm ready to process invocation requests
so what you see is that the client side
and the server side the boundaries right
here the client stub and the server stub
don't have to do anything differently
whether the client of the server are in
the same machine or in a different
machine replicas of the machine cache
copies of the machine none of those
things make a difference in terms of
what the client when I say client I mean
the client application
plus the client stub and similarly the
server plus the server stub they don't
have to do anything different all of the
magic happens down below in the
subcontract mechanism so to recap the
innovations in the spring system uses
object technology as a structuring
mechanism in building and network
operating system and it ensures through
the object technology that it is
providing strong interfaces it is open
it is flexible and it is also extensible
because it is not a monolithic kernel it
has a microkernel and all the services
are provided through these object
mechanism living on top of the kernel
and the other nice property is that the
clients and the server's don't have to
know whether they are co-located on the
same node or they exist on different
nodes of the local area network and
object invitations across the network
are handled through the network proxies
and the subcontract mechanism allows the
client and the servers to dynamically
change the relationship in terms of who
they are talking to you can get new
instances of service instantiated and
advertise that through the subcontract
mechanism so that the clients can
dynamically mind to new instances of
service that have been created without
changing anything in the client-side
application or the client side stuff so
those are all the powers that exist when
you decide how to innovate under the
covers and which is exactly what Sun did
with a spring system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
