to turn our course projects into
something more like the web browsers we
use every day that is a nice question
and it's great to see students
enthusiastic about extending the course
project to get the key ideas across in
the amount of time given we restricted
attention in the course project to
building a static web browser like the
sort of web browser you'd see on an
electronic book reader not particularly
interactive more concerned with
downloading the web page and rendering
it let's say though that we wanted to
work on the project in our spare time
and extend it to become something a
little more interactive if you're
interested in that I would encourage you
to look at two old-style web browsers
elink CLI nks and mosaic the precursor
to netscape or Firefox ie links is an
all text based web browser mosaic was
one of the first visual web browsers
take a look at those and see the sorts
of user interface options that they
offer to get an idea for what the bare
minimum is for working web browser let's
say though that we want to do it
together in my mind the first step would
be to add the ability to have the user
click on links we can already read in a
web page we can already render it out to
a nice image let's say though that we
didn't worry about back buttons we're
not worrying about bookmarks no cookies
nothing fun like that no form input we
just want the user to be able to
navigate around the web by clicking on
links how would we do it well right now
our web browser is more of a batch
processor you give it an employed a web
page and it produces the image and then
it's done we'd want to add a little loop
at the bottom that said wait for user
input wait for the user to click on the
screen and let's imagine that through
our GUI library or our graphics library
or through talking to the operating
system or the windowing system we would
receive some sort of notification
whenever the user clicks in our window
and probably we'd get information like
the x and y coordinate of the mouse
click and whether or not it was a left
click or right click so
we need to build up some sort of mapping
from locations on the screen to whether
or not they correspond to href tags
links the text displayed underneath them
and we could do that while we were
displaying the text on the screen if
it's mostly images up here but then
suddenly there's a link in the middle
we'd want to remember by the way about
halfway down the page if the user clicks
there it's a link and we should know
where to go next how do we know where to
go next that's just the href argument
from that particular tag we already got
that information at the lecture level we
passed it to the parser and we have it
when we're interpreting so we just store
it in some sort of mapping off to the
side so let's imagine that the user
clicks we check our little page to link
mapping if the user is clicking in the
margins or in the whitespace off to the
side we don't do anything but if the
user is clicking in an area
corresponding to a link we fetch the
value of the target location we say oh
it's something like HTTP google com
index HTML and we open up a network
connection in order to fetch that web
page and if you took cs101 at Udacity
you may remember how to do that but if
not it does not take that long to pick
it up and ultimately we'd end up getting
out a new string a new file
corresponding to the contents of that
web page bracket HTML close bracket
welcome to my web page that sort of
thing then we just call ourselves again
and render that new web page and display
it on the screen and then refresh our
little mapping off to the side that map
screen coordinates to links and if we
had this kind of power then the user
could click and navigate their way
through the web and then maybe
eventually we want to add things like a
back button which would just require us
to store a list even a list of strings
of places the user had visited
previously so you can imagine starting
to add abilities like clicking to
navigate through the web going backwards
going forwards again to the framework
that we've already set up and it would
be pretty much as simple as adding a
control loop to the bottom of our exists
bache web browser now let me give you an
idea of something a little more
complicated under the hood the graphics
library that we're using to layout text
actually does a pretty good job of if
you're saying a lot of words welcome to
my web page eventually we'll reach the
end of the screen and it will wrap over
to the next line just like a word
processor or a normal web browser you
might wonder how do i do that if i know
the pages 8 inches wide and i have a lot
of text and i know how big the font is
it's a 12-point font all of the letters
are this wide how do i figure out how
many words to put on the first line how
many words to put on the second line
that sort of thing that problem is
called the word wrapping problem or
perhaps more formally the minimum
raggedness word wrapping problem and it
turns out that the human eye prefers
column layouts that are not ragged on
the side you don't want it to be over
under that kind of thing instead you
want nice even columns like a newspaper
or like a magazine article that looks
more pleasing to the eye well in an
incredible surprise move it turns out
that we can solve this problem using
guess it dynamic programming memoization
there's a mathematical equation you can
write down that sort of penalizes you
for not having smooth columns and then
we can try a bunch of different layouts
which words I put on which lines and
just memorize their badness values how
ugly they would look to the human eye
and at the end of the day we just take
the one that looks the least ugly and it
turns out that that's actually how
professional typesetting pieces of
software like la tech or Microsoft Word
solve this problem so we want to do some
of those things under the hood to make
our output look good and we'd want to
add support for things like clicking and
following mouse click to navigate the
web but ultimately we are pretty much
there with having a web browser that's
similar to some of the earliest
historical web browsers like eel inks
and mosaic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
