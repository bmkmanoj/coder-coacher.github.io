principle component of a data set it's
the direction that has the largest
variance in the data so in our example
that would be this heavy red line here
you can see how this is very different
from a regression although I know it's
sometimes it looks like the same thing
but here what you're trying to do is
you're trying to find the direction of
maximal variance not to make a
prediction so here's a question for you
this is a tough one
so give it some thought and then tell me
what you think why do you think we
define the principal component this way
what's the advantage of looking for the
direction that has the largest variance
in other words when we're doing our
projection of these this two dimensional
feature space down onto one dimension
why do we project all the data points
down onto this heavy red line instead of
projecting them onto the shorter line
just as an example of a different way
that it could be do we want to use this
direction because it's the
computationally easiest direction to
find do you think that it's the best
because it'll retain the maximum amount
of information from the original data
that when we do this two dimensional
compression down to one dimension that
we keep as much information as possible
with this formulation or do you think
it's just a convention and maybe there's
no real reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
