have some funky outliers in here and
down here is the bulk of our data to
determine good x and y limits for our
axes we can look at the 95th percentile
using the quantile command this will let
us see the 95th percentile of W W likes
received and the 95th percentile of
likes received and hopefully we should
get rid of some of these points to do
that I'll use the x lim layer and the y
lim layer will pass 0 as the lower bound
for X Lim and for the upper limit will
use the 95th percentile for the wwx
received
similarly for likes received we'll use
the same sort of syntax and just replace
the variable 0 will be our lower bound
and the 95th percentile for likes
received will be our upper bound when I
run this code where in effect zooming in
on that lower portion of the graph that
we had over here the slope of the line
of best fit through these points is the
correlation and we can even add it to
the plot by using some code we do that
by adding a smoother and setting the
method to a linear model or LM notice to
that I also colored it red so that we
could see it through the black points
let's quantify this relationship with a
number so what's the correlation between
our two variables I don't want you to
have to subset the data so just include
all the data points and then round your
answer to three decimal places</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
