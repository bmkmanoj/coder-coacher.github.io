shared memory and particularly I have
given you a specific example of a
distributed shared memory system called
TreadMarks
that uses lazy release consistency and
multiple writer coherence I just want to
leave you with some thoughts about non
page based DSM systems before concluding
this lesson there have been systems that
have been built that do not use
granularity of a page for coherence
maintenance I mentioned earlier that if
you want to maintain granularity not at
the page level then you have to track
individual reads and writes that is
happening on a thread so one approach is
what is called a library based approach
here the idea is that the programming
framework the programming library is
going to give you a way by which you can
annotate shared variables that you're
going to use in your program whenever
you touch a shared variable part of
creating the executable is to cause a
trap at the point of access to the
shared variable so that the DSM software
will be contacted and the DSM software
can then take the coherence action at
the point of access to the shared
variable so in this case there is no
operating system support needed because
in the binary itself we are making sure
that at the point of access we're going
to result in a trap that will get us
into the trap handler that is part of
DSM software so that it can take the
coherence actions and examples of
systems that use this mechanism include
Shasta that was done at Digital
Equipment Corporation and beehive which
was done at Georgia Tech and because we
are doing this sharing at the level of
variables you don't have any fault
sharing which is possible with page
based systems and single writer cache
coherence protocol so once the DSM
software takes the coherence action
which might include fetching the data
that is associated with a variable that
you're trying to access then the DSM
software can resume this thread that
caused that trap in the first place
another approach to providing shared
abstractions is not at the level of
memory locations but at the level of
structures that are meaningful for an
application and this is what is called
structured DSM so the idea is that there
is a programming library which actually
provides abstractions that can be
manipulated in an application program
and the abstractions can be manipulated
using API calls that are part of the
language runtime so when the application
makes the API call at that point when an
application makes those API calls at
that point the language runtime gets
into gear and says what coherence
actions do I need to make in order to
satisfy this API call all of those
coherence actions are going to be taken
at the point of that API call and that
might include fetching data from a
remote node in the cluster and once the
semantics of that API call has been
executed by the language runtime then
it's gonna resume this thread that made
the call in the first place again there
is no always support needed for this and
the structured DSM is a very popular
approach that has been used in systems
such as Lynda Orca and Stampede that was
done at Georgia Tech and successors to
Stampede called Stampede RT and pts and
in this course later on we're going to
see pts as an example of a structured
dsm system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
