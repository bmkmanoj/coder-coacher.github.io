we already have google and other search
engines what are the advantages of
building another search engine so
certainly you don't want to try to
duplicate something that behaves exactly
at Google does because Google works
pretty well and what it does but there
are lots of things that you can do that
would be different from what Google does
one of the best examples of that is the
search engine called DuckDuckGo and we
had a visit from Gabriel Weinberg a few
weeks ago there's a video with a few
clips from that visit where he talks
about what motivated him to build
DuckDuckGo there'll be a few more clips
of that later in this course where
you'll get some idea of the kinds of
things that he thought were interesting
to make a new search engine and why he
was motivated to build one but there are
lots of things that you can think about
that would be new features that are
different from what Google does or
specialize in your search engine for a
particular kind of corpus that you're
searching for probably you don't want to
try to build a generic web search engine
like Google unless you've got some ideas
how to go beyond that or to do things
differently that will be more
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
