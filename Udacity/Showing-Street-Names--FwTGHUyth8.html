and I'm just changing the location that
we're actually looking at and I've set
it to be the latitude and longitude of
the street right outside the studio
where I'm filming this so I call
panoramas dot set position on this and I
do everything else the same and I'll
show you what the app looks like here
you can see the area outside the studio
and I'm on labem Street and you can see
Latham Street in the Street View itself
and if I go to other places we can see
showers Drive and the other part of
showers Drive and as you as a result you
can see all the street names being
updated here we can see showers drive
again from this angle so street names
are on then you may want to turn this
off the default value is that it would
be on now let's take a look at what it
takes to turn it off now if you remember
it was just panorama dot set street
names enabled and we'd pass it a boolean
I want to turn it off so I'm gonna set
false so now I'm gonna rerun the
application and we'll see what it looks
like and here's the same application
running now with the street names turned
off and you see I can just see the view
outside the street names have not been
overlaid the default behavior was for
street names to be there but I've
overridden that and in some cases it
might make for a better app it's really
up to you and what the needs of your app
are play with the others the user
navigation and the zoom gestured for
yourself and see if you can get some
nice effects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
