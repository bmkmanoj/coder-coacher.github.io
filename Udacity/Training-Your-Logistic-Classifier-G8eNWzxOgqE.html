classifier a logistic classifier is
what's called a linear classifier it
takes the input for example the pixels
in an image and applies a linear
function to them to generate its
predictions a linear function is just a
giant matrix multiplied it takes all the
inputs as a big vector that will denote
X and multiplies them with a matrix to
generate its predictions one per output
class throughout will denote the inputs
by X the weights by W and the bias term
by B the weights of that matrix and the
bias is where the machine learning comes
in we're going to train that model that
means we're going to try to find the
values for the weights and bias which
are good at performing those predictions
how are we going to use those scores to
perform the classification
well let's recap our task each image
that we have as an input can have one
and only one possible label so we're
going to turn those scores in to
probabilities we're going to want the
probability of the correct class to be
very close to 1 and the probability for
every other class to be close to 0 the
way to turn scores into probabilities is
to use a soft max function which I'll
denote here by s this is what it looks
like but beyond the formula what's
important to know about it is that it
can take any kind of scores and turn
them into proper probabilities proper
probabilities sum to one and they will
be large when the scores are large and
small when the scores are comparatively
smaller scores in the context of
logistic regression are often also
called logits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
