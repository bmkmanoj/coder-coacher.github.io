encounter commands that you've never
seen before and we don't expect you to
know everything but we do want you to
keep the following in mind when you
encounter any sort of challenges or
difficulties first take an active role
in problem-solving and be aware of the
resources at your disposal you can type
a question mark in the name of any
function to bring up help documentation
in R so for example I could look up the
documentation for the function mean here
it will tell me any parameters that mean
takes and then it will give me examples
usually at the bottom of the
documentation I can copy and paste these
into the console and press ENTER to see
what the function does here I created
something called X and then if I hit X
in the console I can see what this is
this is just a vector of numbers 0 to 10
and then the number 50 I can take the
mean of X and print it out and finally I
have some sort of trim parameter maybe
you can figure out what this does now if
you can't solve your problem using the
documentation I would suggest googling
it Stack Overflow is also another great
site to browse for help I link to some
of the most useful websites and the
instructor notes and you can also find
these in the course materials under our
resources one of my personal favorites
when I learned art was quicker or stat
methods net' this site has excellent
examples and short pieces of code that
can refresh your memory and get you
going on any data analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
