go to the node that I think is going to
give me the page that I'm looking for
and at least information about the page
that I'm looking for whether it is if it
has it it's gonna give it to me or if it
isn't or if it doesn't have it it's
gonna tell me that it is on the disk but
in either case I'm gonna get I'm hoping
I'll get exact information about this
missing page from this node which is
supposed to have the page frame
directory the PFD that corresponds to
this UID is it possible that I go to
this guy and he says no I don't have it
yes it is possible in two cases one case
is let's say while this guy was sending
this request over this guy has made a
decision to evict that page that
corresponds to this UID because it had
to make space for itself in that case
that UID may have been thrown away from
the PFD and if it has been thrown away
from the PFD what he would have done is
inform the guy who has the ownership for
this UID this node is the owner for this
UID if he Avex that page this guy has to
tell this node that hey you know what I
used to back this UID in my PFD but I
got rid of it and I got rid of it by
sending it to some other node let's say
node D so that is something that I have
to communicate to this GCD but it's a
distributed system
things are happening asynchronously he
may not have communicated that yet that
information is not there in the GCD of
this node this is the owner for this UID
space but the owner doesn't yet know
that the PFD that corresponds to a
particular UID has moved to some other
node out here somewhere and if it has
moved to some other node he will know
about it eventually but he doesn't have
it at this point that's why this request
was routed here and this guy says I
don't have it you can have a mess that's
one possibility
second possibility is the uncommon case
that the P or Dean
that I had is still when can that happen
that is when the p OD is being
recomputed for the local area network as
a whole either because there are new
additions or new deletions of nodes and
therefore we are recomputing the
redistribution of the UID space and
deciding which node is responsible for
which UID that can happen and in that
case also and it's possible that the
information that I started with was
incorrect because I went here thinking
that he has the GCD he didn't have it at
that point but it is changing and
eventually I'm gonna find out so if
there is a mess either case the first
case is this guy replaced that page or
the second case is my period information
mislead me both cases I have a mess and
I'll say oh it was a mess and I know
that it is probably the uncommon case
I'm going to retry that by looking up my
p OD again and by that time the p OD may
have been updated I'll go to the right
GCD this time or the GCD would have been
updated and so I'll go to the same GCD
but the GCD will have the more relevant
information of which PFD is currently
hosting it so I'll go to him in order to
get the piece that I'm looking for but
the important point I want to leave you
with is that the common case is when
both the P o D and GCD of Co resident on
the same node and in that case you don't
have a network communication to look up
the GCD and also the MIS happening when
you do reach the PFD that is also
uncommon it can happen because of
replacement that has happened on that
node or because the p OD has changed and
this is something that is going to
happen relatively infrequently compared
to the activities that we are talking
about in terms of page faults</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
