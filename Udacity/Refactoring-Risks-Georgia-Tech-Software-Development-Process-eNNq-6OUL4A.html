we also saw how refactorings can be
performed automatically within an ID I
would like to make you aware of some
risks involved with the user
refactorings refactorings are a very
powerful tool but you also have to be
careful first of all when you do more
complex refactorings you might introduce
subtle faults what we normally call
regression errors you might change
something in a class you might think
that that's a behavior preserving
transformation when considering the
whole code and instead your change is
affecting the behavior of some other
parts of the code so it's introducing a
regression that will cause some other
functionality some other piece of
functionality some other feature to work
incorrectly so you always have to be
careful and as we saw at the beginning
one way to avoid that is to run tests
every time you make a refactoring every
time you change your code and refactor
your code so as to get at least some
confidence in the fact that your
refactoring is indeed behavior
preserving also consider the refactoring
should not be abused
refactoring should be performed when
it's needed it's useful to improve the
design of your code when you see
problems with the design of the code
shouldn't just be applied for the fun of
it because you can apply it for example
easily within a tool so be careful not
overdoing it when you refactor and for
the same reason that we mentioned at the
beginning you should be particularly
careful when you're using refactoring
for systems that are in production
because if you introduce a problem
before the system goes in production
then you might be able to catch it
earlier with testing or before it's
released but if you introduce a problem
for the system in production then you
have to issue an new version of the code
you'll be affecting you might be
affecting some users because the code
fails on their machines so you have to
be twice as careful when you're doing
refactoring when you're changing your
code for system is already in production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
