associate professor in the school of
interactive computing here at Georgia
Tech and a colleague of mine he and I
actually worked together on the research
we're going to be describing well you're
also the director of the Tannenbaum
Institute here in Georgia Tech can you
tell us about that sure
the Tenenbaum Institute is a
multidisciplinary Research Institute at
Georgia Tech that draws on all ecologist
here at the University and we're
fundamentally interested in how large
complex enterprises change and we use a
systems engineering approach to study
that and we were really brought together
when you decided to use that approach to
model the Center for Health Discovery
and well being a joint Hemery Georgia
Tech project that helps people who have
risks of developing chronic disease
later in life change their lifestyles
and behavior in order to mitigate those
risks we we actually developed a
business strategy using this model that
would fit the needs of all the
stakeholders doing this for acquired
modeling all these interests can you
describe how that was done
certainly so this particular model
involved a four level approach which
consists of people processes
organizations and the ecosystem and
there are interactions that occur within
and across these levels each of these
levels really represents a stakeholder
as well so at the people level we would
look at providers and patients at the
process level we look at how these
healthcare processes are actually
delivered which I'm often delivered by
one or more organizations the third
level in the model and ultimately there
are equal systemic forces that impact
all of these different levels now the
students are familiar with the various
approaches to modeling and simulation so
can you tell us which approach was used
at each level definitely so we did use a
multi simulation paradigm to approach
this particular enterprise so at the
people level we used an agent-based
modeling approach processes tend to be
model as discrete event simulation but
we also found that later on that agent
based simulation was actually quite
appropriate the other two layers were
done both with systems dynamics but
agent-based modeling approaches so a
mixture of different approach absolutely
in one model that's correct
so I know because I was involved how
difficult and time-consuming it was to
get the process layer defined have you
found that to be the case and other
healthcare projects and what do you
think is different about healthcare that
makes its processes so different so
difficult to answer it's quite
remarkable how complex healthcare is so
we found that process modeling in itself
in healthcare is quite challenging as
compared to other domains where it's
actually very well defined Manufacturing
is probably the best example where you
have well-defined processes and you know
how wages float through the system in
healthcare you have enormous amount of
stakeholders that come together you have
teams and collaborations you have
patients moving through the system and
all of that is sort of distributed both
geographically and also temporally and
that makes process modeling quite
challenging in healthcare collecting the
discrete data about events is also a
challenge as opposed to manufacturing
certainly so I think that with an
increasing amount of digital data now in
healthcare as well it's it's still quite
challenging to really clearly lay out
how processes happen so we can leverage
lots of different data sources for that
administrative data clinical data but
even that can be very noisy can be very
messy sometimes there's missing data as
well and then actually identifying
sequences of events in healthcare data
is actually very very difficult so we're
now exploring a more automated approach
to that called process mining can you
explain how that works
sure process mining has really has its
roots in the European academic
disciplines and what they have done is
they've used data mining approaches and
visualization to infer processes from
digital data and it involves lots of
sophisticated analytical tools and the
idea is is that could we use digital
data to sequence together how events map
out so we've done some preliminary work
on that in
treatment of pediatric asthma in the
emergency department can you tell us how
that worked out
sure so we would used digital data for
roughly 6,000 pediatric asthma patients
and the idea was to obviously identify
variations in care by patient strata but
also by providers and the idea was to
identify variations and cost quality and
outcomes we have developed a tool a
visual analytic tool that could actually
map different processes and allows you
to filter by different criteria across
patient strata providers patient
demographic data and this visual
analytic tool can be used by clinicians
to explore how processes are delivered
where there might be actual differences
in care and potentially how to improve
them so I'm sure the students at this
point near the end of the course can
appreciate just how challenging what
Raul just described is to do in practice
given all of the problems we've
discussed throughout the course in terms
of the interoperability of the systems
from which the data needs to be
collected the differences in the way the
data is represented the data quality as
we mentioned a few minutes ago a really
exciting area and you should stay tuned
see where we we end up doing in a few
years thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
