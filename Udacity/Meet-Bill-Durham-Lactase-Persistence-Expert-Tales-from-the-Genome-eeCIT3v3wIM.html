professor in human biology in human
biology and anthropology at Stanford
University well we're really happy
you're joining us especially to talk
about a very important concept now we've
just been learning about lactose
intolerance and about the idea of it as
all infants we have the ability as
mammals to digest these lactose
containing products and as we get older
our lactase expression diminishes but in
some people the lactase gene sort of
stays on and we continue to make lactase
and so I guess we'll start off by asking
why in human evolution with something
like this happen how could something
like this even happen well from a pan
mammalian background where the lactase
activity peaks around birth and then
tails off quickly into the weaning
period and into adulthood we assume we
know that that's pama million even your
house cat is lactose male absorb mal
absorber or lactose intolerant at least
every house cat that's been tested is
even though people will give milk to
their house cats and what we don't know
is whether the people have found the
threshold or the cats found the
threshold to avoid diarrhea and other
consequences what's interesting then is
from that background of a peak some
human population show persistent lactase
activity into adulthood while the
majority continue to decline so it's
that minority of lactose tolerant adults
that are really fascinating it's a
wonderful question because here's a case
where you have an interest specific
polymorphism you have the existence in
the ongoing persistence of a genetic
difference between human populations
with regard to some relatively simple
trait and a trait that has to be
relatively recent in human history there
were no sources of milk prior to dairy
animals so what we have here is I mean
other than Mother's Milk there were no
mammalian sources of milk for human
populations before agriculture so we
assume that the Pema million background
means that at the dawn of history human
populations were all lactose intolerant
and that there would be at best a
mutational a low frequency of
individuals that bear
done that characteristic and because it
was a very low variation and there was
no milk available we would have no way
of knowing how much there was or how
often to record and so on but what we
have then in the meantime is this great
invention called agriculture the
domestication of plants and animals at
the service of the human food supply we
have every reason to believe that the
main animals that are used for milk
today were originally domesticated for
meat they were valued first for me and
that milk was as the expression goes
that were part of a secondary products
revolution where they realized that you
could use more than the meat from these
animals goats sheep you know cattle and
so on and so they already probably had
them in close association with human
communities they were probably already
harvesting the meet regularly they
probably had mastered overwintering
water supply hurting activities and that
sort of thing and then suddenly there's
evidence for using the milk product of
these animals some of the earliest
evidence comes from sahara rock
paintings that are dated to 4500 BP that
show in fact bringing the calf up near
the female that all female and human
being underneath now we infer that the
human being underneath is doing this
what else is a human being doing under a
cow the question really is what was the
added value of drinking fresh milk it's
complicated on the one hand because you
had the meat value of these animals you
domesticated so it seems unlikely that
it would be just the protein or food
supply yet that was a important early
argument the question and and it's all
so complicated because there are ways to
get some food value from milk without
drinking it fresh you can all societies
that I know of have ways of processing
fresh milk into low lactose forms sour
milk is a low lactose form all the
things like yogurt and kefir drinks that
are widely known in some places and most
cheese's break down the lactose extern
using lactobacillus bacteria using a
separation of curds and whey lactose is
water-soluble it drains off with the way
and the Kurds are free of lactose so
most cheeses have very low lactose
concentration something like yogurt is
full of lactobacillus that's already
digesting the lactose for human
consumption so here's the real challenge
in a world where most populations have
ways to process milk and to get
everything that's in the mill why would
some populations still evolve this
persistent lactase activity sure because
their external sources of lactase why
does it have what was the advantage of
producing it internally to the human
organism the leading argument of the day
is that calcium that the advantage of
drinking fresh milk is the advantage of
an additional calcium supply especially
in areas where there is a calcium
deficiency caused either by inadequate
calcium in the diet well that's not too
likely for being drinking milk sure but
a vitamin D scarcity and then people say
well what's the advantage milk is
obviously rich in calcium but what's the
advantage of having what wipe can't you
again just eat the yogurt and why can't
you again just eat the milk product the
cheese which is going to have the
calcium in it except for the water
soluble calcium which you might lose
some of what's interesting with some
research on what's called the lactose
effect if you feed into human infants
from birth in a compare a control
comparison cow's milk from birth or
mothers milk versus soy milk you see
beginning at a matter of a few days you
see a big differential in the amount of
bone absorbed calcium in other words the
calcification of bone is enhanced you
can this is controlling for the amount
of calcium take soy milk and you
supplement the calcium in it so that it
matches the cow's milk they have the
same calcium and the presence of the
lactose enhances the absorption of
calcium according to this these data
that's a magnificent curve and at what
it shows is that the ability to drink
fresh milk has the advantage of making
the calcium that's there an equal
proportion in the two milks it makes it
more available to the infants who can
absorb who can digest the lactose so
what's particularly interesting about
that is it's saying that lactase
persistence compensates for the vitamin
D deficiency that's built in to the
solar radiation pattern on the surface
of our earth so that milk like epidermal
demonization they follow similar curves
and that you get the persistent lactase
activity and lack lactose tolerance at
high latitudes right and so just to sort
of reword which you say you're going to
make sure you know we're clear on this
in the case for skin pigmentation did
you as you sort of alluded to the ideas
as human migration moved away from the
equator yeah to higher and I guess even
I guess we should also say lower
latitudes yes they had less sunlight and
so when I could say higher latitudes
north and south sure higher latitudes
North and South they lost pigmentation
in the skin because they needed to let
more sunlight in for vitamin D there was
selection for the entrance of more
sunlight they was sure they recognized
it yes yes exactly same with milk it
wasn't real were you sitting around here
Wow hoping and wishing we could have
another source of calcium what's
happening is that those that happened to
have this mmmhmm out reproduce bice you
can even test whether it's a three
percent a two percent of five percent
how much does the difference have to be
in the long run in terms of differential
survival and reproduction in order for
this to work out in the time frame that
we have from 4500 years BP or whatever
and I'm one of those who thinks that
it's actually a pretty small advantage
pretty small advantage but persistent
generation after generation no fail it's
there if you have the lactose mechanism
for absorbing calcium and making strong
bones less likely to have rickets less
likely to have Harrison sulcus less
likely to have
broken bones and young adulthood and all
those things you'll have that rigid
calcification of bone which you can see
starting right out in infancy with the
lactose effect thank you so much of
course thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
