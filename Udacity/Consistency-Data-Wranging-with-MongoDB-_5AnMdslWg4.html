with data consistency now in this case
we're going to look at Sac symbols for
three different companies over a period
of several years this is an example
drawn from the bad data handbook Spencer
burns in his chapter when data and
reality don't match tells this story
having to do with unique identifiers for
a few different companies that are
publicly traded so for most of the 20th
century stock symbols for Kmart and
Sears for km and asked respectively
Sprint also during the time it was a
company during the 20th century had the
stock symbol Fon or phone so now let's
take a look at what happened with regard
to these unique identifiers for
companies as we move forward in time and
what I want you to think about is what
type of challenges might this present to
us from a consistency standpoint in
thinking about auditing data and
cleaning data so in 2002 Kmart filed for
bankruptcy and was then d listed as a
stock in 2003 they recovered from
bankruptcy were relisted but this time
with the stock symbol km RT in 2005
Kmart and Sears merged and so all former
shares of Kmart became Sh LD or Sears
Holdings as did Sears stock and then
later that year Sprint changed its stock
symbol from Fon to s so over a period of
several years three different companies
were uniquely identified by five
different stock symbols and in fact two
companies were depending on which point
in time you're talking about uniquely
identified by the same stock symbol now
when we talk about these being unique
identifiers we should really be using
air quotes it's this kind of problem
that we'll often face when we are
looking at data collected from different
points in time the identifiers for
specific entities have a tendency to
change now this type of data is actually
fairly difficult to find so in this quiz
what we're going to do is look at
something similar having to do with when
countries joined the eurozone and what
that means for what currency they were
using at a given point in time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
