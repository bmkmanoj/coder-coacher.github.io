internet all the way to Australia and
speak with graham grieve who for many
years with chief technology officer of
Kestrel a laboratory information systems
company today he's a consultant on
interoperability his company is called
health intersections well Graham I want
to thank you very much for being with us
today I know it's so either early or
late in Australia I'm not quite sure
which but could we begin with you're
telling us a bit about your background
and what led you into the world of
standards initially I started working as
a laboratory scientist after a stint
doing that I got engaged with the vendor
that we're selling as the laboratory
information system and transferred to
working for them for a number of years I
worked as the development leader that
bender and and much of the work that we
did at the vendor maybe eighty to ninety
percent of the work for a while was data
integration of one kind or another I
increasingly got involved with the hl7
side of the integration with the
clinical systems and personally more and
more interested in the standards
community the community space and that
led me to become more involved in actual
seven and eventually i left the vendor
and set myself up as a freelance
consultant contractor doing
interoperability of various kinds well
it's interesting it it makes sense
because as you and I both know clinical
labs were among the first entities in
healthcare to adopt standards so
segwaying forward all the way to march
two thousand eleven and what a high view
is a famous blog post entitled the rise
and fall of hl7 you said that we can
create complex standards but the market
would ultimately reject them can you
explain what you mean by that well we
hadn't spent at that stage 10 or 15
years creating very complex tenders that
set out to define the nature of reality
the nature meaning of clinical
motion and in our pursuit of getting
full control over that complexity we had
developed ever more complicated
specifications the people just couldn't
make them work and the market had
rejected the more complicated variants
of those their implementation efforts
had cost billions of dollars national
programs that squandered a great deal of
money for other reasons than that alone
but definitely for that reason even the
simpler ones now that are going to
market are going to have a very big
market backlash that's quite evident
right now then by that I mean CDA you
know that it's got a real impetus in the
market but your participation rate
reaction and it was clear that we could
continue pushing complicated
specifications but ultimately the market
would say even if you impose this on us
through a government government
regulation we're not going to do it and
I just haven't needed to find a fresh
approach so in that set same blog post
that you proposed the we stated the
problem you propose a solution around
json web services combined with a
simpler data model derived from the rim
and this is come to be called fire can
you explain what fire is to the students
so we started by looking and saying
people out there who are doing
interoperability and getting reckon
getting kudos for doing it well how are
they do it and you know the answer was
invariably restful webservices the it's
a mixture mixture over to the set of
technologies and a set of paradigms
about how information is exchanged that
make the solution simple stable easy to
use in a whole variety of tick of tech
of context and technically very scalable
also there's a great deal of solid
collaborations frameworks around
security and authentication and so forth
which have all developed in support of
the web via is just taking those based
technologies and welding those with what
we know about health information about
getting solid reliable safe exchange of
health information and and just
combining those two to produce it easier
to use specification for exchanging
healthcare information well to do that
fire attempts to define a subset of hl7
rim that meets most day-to-day clinical
needs even for complex patients and as I
understand it that's being defined as
standards really should be through a
collaborative process can you explain
that process how is fire actually being
defined at the detail level it's a
fundamentally it's an iterative process
we have what could combine committees
the gatherings of domain experts from
around the world in particular clinical
or business process specialties within
healthcare we work with those domain
committees to clarify the requirements
that are common and shared and then we
draft the standard based on those
requirements then we work with a bunch
of implementation programs national
programs vendors and we hold connect the
thoughts where anyone can come and try
these things out we have a bunch of
different tryout programs will reiterate
those to where we think it's something
that we can actually use in the
specification then we as HR 7 balance
that which process where all actual
seven members can vote on the quality of
the standard and ask the changes once
that's balloted then we publish that as
a draft standard
and the process starts again eventually
in a couple of years time we'll push it
through to becoming a full-blown
normative standard but we're not in any
hurry because we want to really enter
and that iteration cycle as much as we
can before we commit to normative
standards are not changeable and
everyone's committed to them if we want
to get as much iteration done as we can
before that we get to that point so I'm
sure that feedback from actual adopters
of fire is important to this process how
is fire adoption going now how widely is
it being used today and how do you are
you pleased with where we're at when we
first laid out the project plan for fire
we expected that we would get a little
bit of adoption interest at this phase
we've just published the first draft
it's effectively an early beta we
expected that we'd have a little bit of
engagement with a few users particularly
in the space of personal health record
access crossing the web the web because
the target technologies match and that
personal health access because it's
basically new space and there's not a
lot of established interfaces and and
communities and ecosystems it's not
working out like that we're getting a
whole lot of adoption in a whole lot of
areas more than we can deal with and
it's really tenfold more adoption that
we expected we didn't expect that
because just because of the change part
that is an early beta and that all of
the influences need to accept that the
specification is still subject to change
and therefore their implementations will
have to deal with that we didn't expect
that to be the case and it's just that
the overall advantages of fire are so
compelling that it's driving strong
adoption now rather than having people
wait to see how things develop why
I think that you know you and the fire
community are in the right place at the
right time as adoption of digital
records has grown exponentially at least
here in the United States where the
government is promoting it hella people
are beginning to recognize that without
interoperability the benefits of these
systems are many of the benefits won't
really be recognized and so the
attention is clearly turning to the
interoperability and people are looking
for a workable solution and there you
are with one so congratulations but one
final question as you look at a few
years what do you think we might be with
respect to health data standards fire
and interoperability in general I think
first of all the data exchange is not
something that solves any problems and
that's what we're working on we're
working to make data exchange cheaper so
that it becomes just easier to actually
exchange data but this point real
outcomes merely for exchanging data
beyond that once we can exchange data we
need to have interoperable workflows
interoperable powers of care right now
those things can't exist because the
data interoperability blocks those so I
expect that we'll have increasing focus
on clinical interoperability rather than
health information interoperability and
and that will become more and more
evident over the next few years looking
past that I would really like to see an
environment where healthcare data
availability is no longer the problem
right now it's a big problem for people
within the healthcare process the
providers of the healthcare and a big
problem for consumers although a lot of
them aren't even able to recognize that
I'd like to take that away so the
question is no longer data availability
but you know what do you do with that I
think that will increasingly see the
adoption of health to
at which wich people often call
patient-centered health care that does
depend on facile information I think
that we will see aggregation towards a
number of very few providers of very
large healthcare record systems and a
huge differentiation in the provision of
access and control and exchange of the
information between the various records
on the very large providers and those
very large providers will probably
aggregate out of consortiums of large
healthcare provider networks which are
forming now and or national programs and
we'll probably cross jurisdictional
boundaries those are the things that
we're starting to see happen now but
there are still a long way away from big
reality well I think you're absolutely
right on i particularly like your your
comments earlier on about the need to
develop better and more standardized
clinical processes and workflows that
that is clearly going to be the next
challenge after we have sufficiently
standardized data it's been great
chatting with you I'm sure the students
have gained a lot from this discussion
and I can I can only thank you again for
taking the time either very early or
very late your data to be with me today
thank you very much licious thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
