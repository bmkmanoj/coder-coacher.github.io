on top of imagery particularly icons or
text when doing so you'll need to ensure
that is clear and legible this is
especially important for dynamic content
when you don't know exactly what the
color or how complicated the image will
be for example with this dark image we
can see the title text and the share
icon but if the image given to us is
light the title and icon gets somewhat
lost
so the overlaid icon we can use a subtle
shadow and on the image to separate it
from the background so here we've added
a subtle dark shadow to the white icon
so that it's visible even if the content
behind is similarly colored third text
adding shadows are possible but it can
make the text itself somewhat harder to
read a better approach is to use what we
call a scrim now this is a
semi-transparent layer between the image
and the text to help provide contrast
and legibility here we're using a
gradient scrim which goes from 30%
opaque black at the bottom to complete
transparency the black gives enough
contrast for the overlaid white text to
be readable let's take a look at the
scrim from an angle giving you a clearer
representation of what's going on now
the gradient sits on top of the image
but below the overlay text we could have
used a solid block of color rather than
a gradient which would reduce the
overall impact on the image but the
sudden change can be distracting you
should tune the size of your scrim and
the opacity values to get the best
legibility without distracting from the
image to implement this technique we can
use a gradient drawable placed on top of
an image view so here we're creating a
gradient and it's going to fade from
this color here which is 30% opaque
black at the bottom it's a completely
transparent at the center on top we can
then use a frame layout to stack our
views first we place the image view at
the back to display the picture next we
place a view which has that scrim draw
wall we just created that set as its
background and then finally we place a
textview on top of it we're going to
draw the text here at the bottom so
don't be afraid of layering content on
top of imagery it can be a great effect
creating immersive apps do however be
careful to make sure that it's always
legible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
