collaboration based design when we did
object oriented analysis we were
essentially picking out the important
objects in the description of the real
world and we're using those as the basis
of deciding on classes and and the
associations among them and eventually
we got to the stage where we were
mentioning methods that the classes
might provide a services collaboration
based design takes a somewhat contrary
approach to things in particular its
concern it starts with the use cases
individual use cases sometimes called
user stories or scenarios and with these
use cases each use case has various
actors playing specific role for that
use case collaboration design by the way
is sometimes called role based design so
we can say that for a particular actor
participating in a particular use case
that actors fulfilling some kind of role
so let's specify that role that role
takes the form of the actions that that
user takes in that user story once we
have cataloged those actions okay we can
then examine other use cases that
involve that same actor and from the set
of activities which that actor under
undergoes in the various use cases we
have built up a set of rules and the
combination of that set of rules is in
fact going to be what the overall
capability that that class must provide
so we can synthesize the classes from
the set of rules we've defined during
this this process I'm not going to go
into role based design any further but
you may come across it in the literature
or you may want to look into it more
yourself and try it out because it can
be an alternative approach that might be
helpful under some circumstances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
