settings and secrets such as TLS certs
to run on a production environment one
problem we saw before when we use docker
was that many des want to bacon their
configs and put those on the public
backer don't do it so then what should
we do some say to put configuration
management tools into the pod you can
you shouldn't there's a better way
kubernetes our config maps and secrets
to take care of these problems config
maps and secrets are similar except
config maps don't have to be sensitive
data they can be used as environment
variables and they can tell downstream
pods that configuration has change
allowing a pod to restart itself if
necessary let's talk about secrets it's
really easy to create a secret from a
file using the cube CTL create secret
command in our example we've done this
and the kubernetes master already knows
about our secret then we can upload that
secret to a pod let's see how this works
what happens if we start up a pod that
uses a secret
well after we run this cube CTO create
pod command a pot is created then our
secret is mounted onto our pod is a
volume this way communities can make
sure that our configs are there before
our containers start once that volume is
there we can take the contents of it and
expose it on the filesystem so ever our
pods would go to mount it then our pod
starts to come online and finally our
container is spun up we're good to go
so now let's have Kelsey teaches more
about creating secrets to store
sensitive application data and creating
config maps to store application config
data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
