random in our dice rolling program and
we know that random is a math function
that Java provides that outputs a random
double between 0 &amp;amp; 1 but how did you
know that this function would produce
this 0 to 1 output we walk through how
to use it together and what about our
print Lim function that we've used a lot
how would you have known how to print a
line of text if we didn't go over at
first you wouldn't have and that's what
documents come in useful you can find
out more about any built-in java
functions like math functions or
printing functions just by looking at
the available Java documentation
documentation is a fundamental feature
of any big programming language it's a
huge resource for programmers because
good documentation provides all the
information we need to know it tells us
about built-in functions as well as
different variable types and shows us
how to use these functions in our own
programs so programmers of all levels
use documentation regularly Java is
owned by Oracle who maintains the most
up-to-date Java documentation on their
website and I'll provide the link to the
latest documentation page for Java in
the notes below next let's dive into
some documentation and learn more about
math functions to learn more about math
functions the first thing we need to do
is search for the information we want
since we're interested in math let's
search something like math Java 8
documentation so we've specified what
we're looking to learn more about math
our version of Java Java 8 and that
we're looking for documentation and any
similar searches should work just as
well and our first page result looks
promising
it's a Doc's oracle.com page so let's
click on this this takes us to the math
Java documentation page so let's look at
what this has in it this will be the
general structure for all of Oracle's
documentation pages first we can see
that it says class math and the class is
something that groups together multiple
functions and sometimes variables and
it's why when we've used math functions
like random we've had to say
math dot random in our function call and
not just random by itself this way Java
knows that this function can be found in
the math class and we'll get into
classes more later on when we talk about
objects so don't worry too much about
this for now next there's this general
description of math and it tells us that
the class math contains methods and
methods are the same thing as functions
so it says it contains methods or
functions for performing basic numeric
operations like exponents logs square
roots and trig functions cool then if we
scroll down more there's more
description and the next thing we see is
a field summary and the field is just a
name for a variable that's part of a
class like how functions are part of the
math class for functions in the math
class we've had to say something like
math dot random or math dot whatever
function name in order to call them and
these variables are accessed in the same
way so we can use the exact value of
something like pi which is around 3.14
by saying math dot pi in our programs
but don't worry too much about fields
for now because we're mainly interested
in the functions that Java provides the
next section is called method summary
and this is the section that were most
interested in this summary has a list of
all the functions that Java provides
these are functions that we can use like
math dot random and there are a lot
they're all listed in alphabetical order
let's scroll down to the one we're
interested in random here's our familiar
random function it's listed in the
method summary and it contains a short
description this says it returns a
double value greater than or equal to
zero and less than one and we can click
on random for even more information so
let's do that here's the documentation
for the random function we see the start
of its function definition public static
double random with empty parentheses
double is its return type and it means
as returning a double as output then
Paige has a brief description of the
entire function and it tells you exactly
what it does it tells you it returns a
double value between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and it tells
you a bit about how that value is chosen
it also has this return section that
tells you exactly what return value you
should expect a pseudo-random double
greater than or equal to zero and less
than one point zero so just by looking
at this documentation we can tell
exactly what this function does what it
returns and if it requires any input
data next we'll look at the
documentation for a math function that
we haven't seen and see if we can figure
out what it does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
