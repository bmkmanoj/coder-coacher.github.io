finding the distance between two points
here and here and here and here when we
found the distance between these two
points we set up a right triangle and
found the horizontal distance between
them and the vertical distance between
them this allowed us to use the
Pythagorean theorem to find the
hypotenuse or the diagonal between the
two points the same was true in this
case for town too we found the distance
horizontally between the mile markers
and then the distance vertically or
south to go to the town we squared these
two numbers and found their sum and then
took the square root to get the distance
we can do something similar if we wanted
to find the distance between any two
points so let's say we have these points
negative seven and three and five and
eight we can think of drawing two
interstates our roads horizontally and
vertically and the distance between the
two points is the diagonal or the
hypotenuse of the right triangle we just
created to find the vertical distance
between the two points we want to look
at the Y values we can think about this
vertical distance as starting at y
equals 3 then it goes all the way up to
y equals 8 so if we find the difference
or the amount between the Y values will
get the vertical distance which is five
here so knowing this what do you think
would be the horizontal distance what's
this distance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
