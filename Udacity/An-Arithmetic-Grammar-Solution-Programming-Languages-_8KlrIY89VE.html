of these three rules so in particular I
could use the third one and just replace
exp with number so number is definitely
in the language of the grammar it's one
of the strings that I can derive
unfortunately negative number is not
there's no way to get a minus sign
without an exp before it we take a look
at all three of our rules the minus sign
only appears once and there's something
before it so this isn't going to happen
over here number plus number plus number
it looks pretty big but I could get it
by applying this first rewrite rule
twice and then turning each one of these
expressions into numbers I've drawn it
in kind of this tree format we will see
more on that in a minute but for now
just imagine I did this because I ran
out of space in the corner poor planning
on my part similarly we could get number
minus number plus number just by getting
a minus sign here instead using rule two
and rule one in combination over here
there's no way to get number next to
number whenever we get multiple
expressions on the right hand side
they're always separated by a terminal
this can't happen so just to review this
uses rule one rule two and rule 33 times
this is roll one that's rule to its rule
33 times in order to derive this string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
