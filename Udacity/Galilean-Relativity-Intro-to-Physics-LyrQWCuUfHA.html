relativity so there we see it that word
relativity not special in front of it
yet but we're getting there in this term
which is the first postulate of special
relativity it says that the laws of
physics are the same in all inertial
frames of reference now these are words
we haven't seen before but don't worry
frames of reference we can think of for
now is just meaning point of view an
inertial this means moving at a constant
speed or being at rest so what the
sentence is really saying is that the
laws of physics are the same in all
points of view which are either moving
at constant speed or at rest
and in fact this concept of rest is a
very strange one even in the Train even
if we could have opened the window on
the train and seeing the world flying by
us is it the train moving or is the
world moving beneath the Train all we
can say for sure is that the world and
the Train we're moving relative to each
other
this idea of absolute rest is one we
really have to sort of abandon now that
we have this idea of Galilean relativity
so what I want you to tell me is which
of the following is an inertial frame of
reference a bike accelerating downhill a
car parked on the street a plane
traveling along at a constant speed of
500 kilometers per hour or an object
which has recently been dropped off the
Leaning Tower of Pisa and is now in
freefall check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
