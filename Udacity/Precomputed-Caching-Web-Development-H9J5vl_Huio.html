we added to help a scale was this notion
of a pre computed cache we find
ourselves running these queries to
generate the hot page for read over and
over and over again you may cash it for
a minute but then once that minute
expired whether recalculated and we had
a job that would cron job that would run
and just compute it and then put the
stored value in memcached that worked
okay but then we had to do it you know
we had all of our users pages every user
had their own listings of things they
submitted and liked and their top things
and every read it had a new page in a
hot page and a bunch of different sorts
so we started precomputing everything so
the way we did that is we had this whole
other database stack these were replicas
of the linked database basically more
linked databases they could lag a little
bit it wasn't a big deal
every time I vote would come in we put
it in this queue queue is just a list of
things to be done I would have this this
machine that basically manages huge
lists of things and then we had a couple
other machines that we call the pre
compute servers and what these things
would do is they would take jobs off the
queue this link has been voted on
actually what the apps would do is when
a link was voted on they would add like
a number of jobs to the queue and the
jobs might be recompute read its front
page recompute this users liked page
recompute this users top page recompute
reddit stop it there's all sorts of
different listings that are affected by
a particular vote and these machines
would pull off these jobs and then
they'd run those queries against the
database
they were just mercilessly as fast as I
could take a job off the queue run the
query against these databases so these
databases were really really hot no
real-time requests no requests from the
internet actually ever touched these pre
compute machines there's only these guys
these pre compute servers would touch
these pre compute databases and when the
job was done running we would take the
result and store it a memcached and so
that way almost every page you looked at
on reddit would be fetched out of
memcached there are very few things you
can do on reddit that actually directly
manipulate a database and once we got to
that point of scaling things got a lot
easier these are really just kind of the
last resort like primary sources of data
but any data you can access on reddit in
real time was actually served out of
memcached every single listing is pre
computed and stored and memcached for
writing on the whole site this is the
reason why now you can't go back beyond
about a thousand links on any particular
listing used to be you could go to
Reddit front page and hit next next next
next next and go all the way back to the
beginning of time which will just really
really trounce our databases do a lot of
damage slow the site down etc etc you
can't do that anymore we only store the
top thousand for each sort which is one
of the limitations
doing this precompute thing but on the
upside the cycle is very very fast there
are very few legitimate reasons to go
all the way back to the beginning of
time on reddit anyway this worked out
really nicely and the site to this day
still has this general structure
although a lot of the technologies have
changed and that's what we're going to
talk Neil about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
