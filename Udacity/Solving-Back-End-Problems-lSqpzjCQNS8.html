along going really well actually I just
finished my front end and I even managed
to integrate the google maps api great
job so what's your next step well i was
thinking i want to start adding pictures
of the places I've been to that's a
great idea so if you do this one of two
ways you can hard code images into HTML
or you can create a database to store
thousands of images well I definitely
want to add as many pictures as I
possibly can sounds like that will
require some knowledge on back-end
programming let's check it out have you
ever thought about what happens when you
post data to the internet like a status
update we take for granted that our
content actually shows up like how does
that happen the process that occurs
behind the scenes requires interactions
between clients which is your device or
computer and servers a gigantic computer
that processes data whenever I log into
my Twitter account my account is the
client and I'm interacting with Twitter
servers when I compose a tweet and click
this button I'm creating a post request
it's as if the Twitter bird carried my
tweet to their servers my tweet is then
saved in the Twitter database and then
sent back to my computer and loaded on
my twitter feed this is a post request
I'm creating content and data and
posting it to Twitter's database their
servers then return it back to my
browser whenever i see my twitter feed
with all the tweets i've created in the
past i'm creating a get request i'm
getting all the data from twitter server
when i go to my Twitter homepage i'm
creating a get request to get all the
tweets associated with my account it's
then sent back to my computer and all of
those tweets are loaded on my browser
this is a get request because I'm
getting all the data associated with my
account and retrieving it back to my
browser understanding the climb
server model is essential for back-end
programmers okay that was a lot of
information let's just take a moment to
review posts and get requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
