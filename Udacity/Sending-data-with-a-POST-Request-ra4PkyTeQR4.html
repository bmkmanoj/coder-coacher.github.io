server to send data to us using the get
method however sometimes you might want
the user to type in some data or upload
a picture and send that to the server
this is where the post method comes into
play that we mentioned earlier with a
post request the request itself can also
have a payload obody something we have
already seen in responses but not in
requests what exactly happens to the
data once it has been sent to the server
is up to the back-end developer and it's
not in the scope of this course it is
however important to know that post
requests are potentially looked
differently by proxies and the browser
than get requests have you ever seen one
of these this is what happens when the
page you're currently looking at was the
result of a post request if you try to
reload such a website the browser will
prompt you to confirm this read of the
action as post requests are allowed to
be destructive operations and repeating
it might be more destructive than you
originally intended that's why it is
usually recommended for the back-end
developer to not respond to a post
request with a website but with a
redirect to avoid this rather jarring
behavior for the user this redirect is
practically invisible
but avoids the prompt on reload</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
