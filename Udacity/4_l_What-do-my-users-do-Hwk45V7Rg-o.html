in your app first you need to identify
what's important to know about what your
users are doing do you care if they set
preferences maybe you want to know if
they reach a certain level in your game
perhaps you want to know they ordered
takeout or if they clicked an ad so
here's the code to send an event hit to
analytics you create the tracker should
know how to do that by now then you use
an event builder to build an event hit
you set the category the action and the
label and these three things that
category the action and the label are
going to show up in the analytics
dashboard and you put this code wherever
you want to record the event so I'd like
to know which the dinner options are
unpopular which ones people don't want
to see again so I'm going to add the
code to track the event in the method
that's called when the user presses this
button in this case it's the remove meal
method so this is a remove meal method
in the show dinner activity this is the
method that gets clicked when users
press the button to say they don't like
a meal so this method creates an intent
to start the remove meal activity and
here's where I've added the code to send
a hit to analytics I get the tracker I
build the event I've set the category to
dinner action set the action to dislike
dinner choice and here I'm passing in
the selected dinner so I can keep track
of actually which dinner it is that
users don't like so to see the report
for the events in the an analytics
dashboard you go to behavior events and
overview while you're waiting for the
data to show up in the analytics
dashboard you can check the log in
Android studio to make sure that the
hits did in fact get sent and Indian
analytics dashboard in the events
overview make sure that the date range
includes today's date so I actually had
to wait about half an hour for these
events to show up but here they are you
see the event categories I've only got
one
category you see the actions and again
I've only got one action and you see the
labels when you can drill down into the
events drill down into the actions so
here I can see that the tofu and
coriander salad was the most disliked
with three dislikes and you can see
other data about the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
