it the future is I've done a fair amount
of angel investing so we've seen a lot
of people come in and pitch ideas and
when you're watching people that pitch
these ideas you know there's a lot you
can tell from body language you can lot
that you can tell about how people talk
about how they got into this current
area that they're in and the problem
that they want to set want to solve and
you can really feel that passion I think
as far as growing a team around you as
an entrepreneur you know as an investor
you can look at the entrepreneur and you
can see well who's helping them who are
their advisors who are the people who
have already signed up maybe before
there's ever any money before the
business is formed and you can see those
started to see a lot of evidence of
whether the person can really do this or
not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
