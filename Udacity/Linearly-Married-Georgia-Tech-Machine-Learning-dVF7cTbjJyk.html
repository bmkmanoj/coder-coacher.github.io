on the screen for you because I want to
illustrate a problem so you see this
little graph that I have it looks just
like all the other graphs you've drawn
so far more or less I think there are
fewer points but I think you're right it
more or less looks like the same one and
we found the line that is linearly
separating the two clouds of points and
you agree that's a technical term and
you agree that it literally separates
them and you're even willing to accept
for the purposes of this discussion that
is in fact the line that maximizes the
margin sure even if it's not okay cool
so this is easy right so what are you
gonna do Michael if I take this now and
I add one more point here's the point
that I'm going to add it's another - I
can pick it two things to do one is I
can put a vertical line through it and
that makes things really separable again
that's not usually allowed and the other
one is since it's a different color I
feel like I can just erase it no that's
not acceptable I control the pen I mean
in some sense the maximum margin is now
negative right because this this point
there's going to be no way of slicing
this up so that all the negatives are on
one side and all the positives on the
other that's true it's not linearly
separable okay anything of some clever
way to fix it well again I mean I feel
like I'm is making a joke before but
maybe a reasonable thing to do is to
have some kind of you know I'm allowed
to delete some number of points thing or
or finally find the line that linearly
separates the positives and the
negatives while at the same time
minimizing the number of things that are
on the wrong side right so you wouldn't
be linearly separating separating them
but you'd be finding a line that makes
sort of the minimal set of errors while
also maximizing the margin if you kind
of were allowed to flip a few points
from positive to negative and negative
deposit I think that's what you said
yeah and then you need to have some kind
of new knob now to trade off those two
things right and it turns out you can do
that we're not going to talk about it
instead we're going to make a homework
assignment about it and let the students
think about it a little bit but I think
even that little clever thing that you
came up with even though it is used
won't work in another case that I'm
thinking of so let me draw that case for
you
okay Michael how does that look well the
good news is it's not exactly like all
the other grass you've drawn but it is
it is very similar to it there's going
to be a linear separator that falls
between that bottom plus and the line of
minuses and there's a maximum margin one
so it seems all within the bounds of
what we've been talking about that's
true you're very smart what if I add
just a few more points okay that doesn't
seem like just a few right so I guess
this is different from the other example
because whereas before it looked like
there was maybe like an outlier or an
intruder now it's like there's a ring
around the whole thing oh is that why
they're linearly married yes ha all
right
so now you know you can draw lines all
day long and it's just not going to
slice things up that's right so now we
have to come up with some clever way of
managing to make this work
or we're going to have to throw away
support vector machines all together and
I like support vector machines so I want
to avoid doing that so here's the little
trick we're going to do I am going to
change the data points without changing
the data points it's going to be a neat
trick that seems possible and impossible
here's what I'm going to do Michael I am
going to define a function okay here's
the function I'm going to create a
little function here and this function
is going to take a data point okay and
because we've been using too many X's
and eyes and Y's and J's I'm simply
going to call it Q okay now Q is one of
the points that are in it's in the same
dimension as these other points so in
this case it's two dimensions in a plane
okay and I'm going to transform that
particular point Q into another kind of
point but I'm going to do it in a way
that doesn't require cheating okay you
ready
sure I'm perplexed but okay okay so what
is QQ is in the Y as in the in the plane
so that means it has two different
components Q 1 and Q 2 and I'm going to
produce from those two components Q 1
and Q 2 a triple so I'm going to put
that point into three dimensions now and
the dimension is going
look like this how does that look
Michael strange
so you took so Q is a two-dimensional
point so it's got q1 and q2 or it's two
components and you're saying you're
going to take the first component make a
new vector where the first component of
that is squared take the second
component make a new vector where the
sec that that value is the second
component squared and now just because
apparently it wasn't weird enough you're
going to throw in a root two times the
product of those two as the third
dimension okay so you're you know you
have an interesting sense of style I do
I kind of like now let me point out
something for you
one is I haven't actually added any new
information in the sense that I'm still
only using q1 and q2
yeah through a constant in there and I'm
multiplying by one another but at the
end of the day I haven't really done
much it's not like I've thrown in some
boolean variable that gives you some
extra information all I've done is
taking q1 and q2 and multiply them
together or against one another just
because why not okay okay
all right now why did I do this I did
this because it's going to turn out to
provide a cute little trick and in order
to see that cute little trick we need to
return to our quadratic programming
problem so let me remind you what that
equation was all right Michael so I've
written up the equation for you as I
promised I would remind you of the
quadratic program that we're trying to
solve I didn't write down all of the
constraints and everything I'm hoping
that you remember them and I wrote it up
in for a reason and the reason I wrote
it up is because you recall just not too
long ago I asked you to talk about X I
and XJ and what it looks like in this
equation and what I think we agreed to
or at least I know I agree too is that
we could think about X I transpose XJ as
capturing some notion of similarity so
it turns out then if we sort of buy that
idea of similarity that really what
matters most in solving this quadratic
problem and ultimately solving our
optimization problem is being able to
constantly do these transpose operations
so let's ask the question that if I have
this new function fee or fie or whatever
the right pronunciation is what would
happen if I took two data points and I
did the transpose or the dot product
between them what would I get
so let me just write that out or I don't
know you can try telling me if you want
to so let's make that let's make that
let's make that simple Michael and in
fact let's make it so simple we can make
it into a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
