only do they allow us to organize our
own code better then allow us to share
code with other people and sharing is a
great thing it allows us to write much
more interesting programs much more
quickly than if we had to write
everything ourselves one very useful
module that we could have used for the
search engine if we were using modules
instead of learning by writing all the
code ourselves is this great Python
library for processing web pages known
as beautiful soup and you can see the
beautiful soup page here there's a link
to it in the instructor comments as well
and to use it first you need to download
it as long as you've got the Python
package manager already set up which
most of you probably do if you installed
the standard version of Python you can
do it just using this command unlike
other modules we've imported so far
beautiful soup is not part of the
standard Python library so to use it you
have to install it first if you have p
IP installed this is really easy p IP is
a Python package installer all we would
need to do is this it would know how to
download it and install it and set it up
to work on your machine if you don't
have P IP installed already there are
directions for how to set up P IP in the
instructor comments it's very useful as
set this up makes it much easier to
install packages after that now that
we've installed beautifulsoup we can
import it into our search engine code
and instead of all the code that we
wrote for extracting links we can use
what beautifulsoup already provides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
