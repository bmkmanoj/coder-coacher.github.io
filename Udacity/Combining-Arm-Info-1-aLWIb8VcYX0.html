bound gives us a way of thinking about
how many samples we need to accurately
learn the value of an arm so we're gonna
have to actually pick a number for that
how many samples were going to take of
each arm to guide us in that decision
it's going to be helpful to think about
how we're going to combine information
across the arm so this is going to be a
strategy that will ultimately work
though we don't have all the details
filled in yet and it goes like this what
we're going to do is we're going to take
see samples of each arm for some value
see that's what I was going to do the
sea is going to be some function of
epsilon Delta K that sort of thing but
but it's going to be some number and
it's going to be a number that well
we're going to see so so we couldn't be
number so number that guarantees that
were some amount closed with some
certainty and then after that point
we're going to choose the arm that has
the highest estimate the best estimate
ultimately we want our final decision
here to be epsilon close to the optimal
decision with probability 1 minus Delta
so I claim that to do that for this to
work we need to learn each arm
individually to an accuracy of epsilon
over 2 and with a certainty of 1 minus
delta / k</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
