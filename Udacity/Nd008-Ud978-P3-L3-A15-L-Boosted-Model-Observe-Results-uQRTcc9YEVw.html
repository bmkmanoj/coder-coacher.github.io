view the results in the Browse tool and
I'll walk you through the main points of
this output what we were able to see
first is in record one and what I look
at here is the loss function
distribution and like we set as default
before is going to be the multinomial
option which means we have a categorical
variable that we're trying to predict
and these categories is more than two
it's three or greater so it's or
non-binary type of classification
problem like we have here the other
thing that I see is the number of trees
that were used so before with the force
model we used 500 trees with the
decision tree we use one tree over here
you use 4000 and that was actually a
maximum threshold so really this model
probably took a very long time to run
because it created four thousand trees
but most likely there's a very good
chance it's going to be more accurate
than the other models what I look at
then is next in record to this variable
importance plot that we see in both the
forest model and the decision tree model
and we're able to see which variables
are most important to each of these
different models and so it looks like
just like we saw before the distance
that someone lives away from their work
is the most important variable to the
model then after that age while gender
and marital status don't even contribute
at all to this model record three are
the number of iteration assessment plot
what this shows is the amount of
variance are rather deviance that is
captured with more iterations and what
this shows is that the more trees added
the smarter the prediction became as
well the estimation sample and the end
model sample that are both built in this
model are very close meaning this model
performs well on an independent sample
we're going to continue to test how well
this model performs with the now
scouring the validation sample with the
model comparison tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
