talk through a couple of points as to
why we should care about missing data
before we complete an analysis using
that data one of the more basic reasons
we might care about missing data is that
some statistical algorithms just won't
work if there are values missing from
the data obviously we can't move forward
with an analysis if the process we're
using won't get us to the end result so
in those cases we just have to deal with
the missing data a second more subtle
reason is that missing items can add
bias to a model now the term bias and
statistics refers to the tendency of an
analysis to either over or under
estimate the values of that specific
field or parameter in other words if
bias is present it could push the model
results higher or lower depending on how
much bias there is in one of the
variables we're using for example in our
hypothetical survey where one of the
questions is related to age many older
respondents might be hesitant to give
their age and if we could actually know
what the real ages of the respondents
are then we would have a more accurate
picture and one of the facts we would
find is that the average age of the
respondents is really 44 and a half but
without the real data there we would be
working with an average age of 40
depending what our business question and
analysis was trying to solve we would be
creating downward bias that is biased
towards a younger demographic in our
analytic model this could affect our
results and more importantly the
business decisions could be made on
inaccurate modeling as a side note if
you'd like more information on the
various ways a model process can be
affected by bias take a look at these
