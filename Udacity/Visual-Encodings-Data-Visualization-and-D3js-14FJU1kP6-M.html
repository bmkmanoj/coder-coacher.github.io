types let's look at the many options of
visual encodings that we have simply put
visual encodings are a mapping from data
to display elements the visualization
that we saw before shows the correlation
between income per person and life
expectancy in many different countries
this graphic is rich with visual
encodings let's take a look at some of
those visual encodings now life
expectancy is encoded visually along the
y axis while spinning per person is
encoded along the x axis for data
visualization this means that countries
that are located in the top right corner
of the graph like Qatar have a high
income per person and high life
expectancy the opposite would be true
for the countries in the lower left of
the graph position is considered a
planar variable because it locates
points in space it's probably one of the
most prominent visual encodings that
you'll see in data visualizations and
it's also a display element that we can
perceive with great accuracy so we know
that position can be good for encoding
two variables but what do we do if we
want to visualize higher dimensions of
the data say a third variable well we
could visualize a third variable and the
third dimension so along the z-axis here
however 3d models are generally poorly
perceived by our eyes as it's more
difficult to make quantitative
comparisons between points for example
I'm not so sure which of these two
points has a greater Y value or height
so we need some other way of encoding
some third variable for our data
visualization fortunately we have some
other display elements that we can use
instead we can use what are called
retinal variables to encode additional
variables for a data set size is an
example of a retinal variable and it's
particularly good for ordered data going
back to our World Health data
visualization we can see that population
is encoded by the size of each of the
circles or more precisely by the area of
each point in combination with color the
size attribute makes some countries more
recognizable such as India China
and the United States size and color hue
which we just saw in the visualization
are both examples of retinal variables
and if we wanted to we can even encode
additional variables and these other
retinal variables size orientation and
color saturation are particularly
effective for ordered data however it
may be difficult to perceive
quantitative differences using these
visual encodings the perceived value
difference between say light blue and
light light blue isn't so obvious these
other retinal variables such as color Q
shape and texture are great for encoding
nominal variables for our Gapminder
visualization we can see that color hue
encodes the geographical regions of the
world this choice of color makes it
easier to compare income and life
expectancy across developed and less
developed countries of the world the
last variable we need to address is time
now time isn't a static display element
like color size or position instead time
is animated through individual frames in
our visualization the quick succession
of these frames shows change in life
expectancy income per person and
population over time it's the remarkable
and engaging aspect of this
visualization and we'll learn how to
incorporate this type of dynamic
visualization in Lesson four now that
you've seen one example of how to map
data to display elements we're going to
see if you can do it for two more
visualizations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
