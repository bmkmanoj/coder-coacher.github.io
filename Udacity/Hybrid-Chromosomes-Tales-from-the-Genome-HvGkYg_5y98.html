times if I've said it once but you have
two copies of every chromosome one for
mom and one from dad I find it easier to
understand where my chromosomes come
from if I color them pink say for the
ones that came from mom and blue for the
ones that came from dad but let's not
forget that your mom and your dad also
had chromosomes from their parents the
maternal and paternal lines of their own
your maternal grandma and grandpa and
your paternal grandma and grandpa and we
could keep drawing this farther and
farther back in time but if you like to
think about it you're a mix of your
grandparents as much as you are your
parents if we just look over here on
your mom's side she had a whole set of
chromosomes from her mother and a whole
set of chromosomes from her father and
she didn't just pass down a whole
complete chromosome set from one of her
parents to you when her germ cells
underwent meiosis her chromosomes
actually crossed over this had the
effect of mixing and matching her own
parents chromosomes your grandparents
chromosomes so that when she passed
these chromosomes on to you you'll
notice that your maternal chromosomes
are actually a mix of your grandparents
chromosomes recombination is what allows
you to actually have chromosomes that
are mixes and matches of your
grandparents now we could go back in
time to your great-grandparents and we
could have an even finer resolution map
with four colors instead of two or your
great-great grandparents and do a colors
instead of four and let's not forget
about your dad over here either your
paternal chromosomes came from your
father who had a mother and father
himself and his own maternal and
paternal chromosomes underwent
chromosome recombination and the result
is a mix and match of your dad's parents
as chromosomes and then he passed one
set of those chromosomes onto you so
you're also a mix of your paternal
grandparents as well so based on
recombination in these inheritance
patterns from your parents and
grandparents how much DNA identity do
you share with any given grandparent go
ahead and pick which answer you think is
best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
