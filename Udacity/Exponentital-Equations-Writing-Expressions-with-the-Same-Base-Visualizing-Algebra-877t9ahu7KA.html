thinking if you got this number now if
this gave you some trouble that's okay
we haven't had a lot of practice
rewriting numbers with different bases
so let's see how it works I know that
both 27 and 81 are the result of raising
three to a certain power for example 3
cubed is 27 and 3 to the fourth is 81
notice too that now I have the same base
I have a 3 here and a 3 here but before
I do anything let's combine these two
exponents when we raised a power to a
power you multiply these two together
this is how we get 3 to the 3x equals 3
to the fourth power now since these two
bases match we set these exponents equal
to one another so we'll have 3x set
equal to 4 here and then we'll divide
both sides by 3 to get x equals 4 thirds
and if you check this in a calculator or
by hand you'll definitely see that 27
raised to the four thirds equals 81 we
know this is true since the cube root of
twenty-seven equals three and three to
the fourth power is 81 so yes our answer
checks and we can be sure that it's
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
