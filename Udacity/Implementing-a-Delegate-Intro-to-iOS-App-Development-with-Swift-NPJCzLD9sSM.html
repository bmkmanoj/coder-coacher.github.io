need to do on the top right hand corner
let's add them to our code now we're
looking at record sounds view controller
and what I'm going to do is add a V
audio recorder delegate to the class
declaration there step one is done for
step two I will scroll down to the
record audio function where we are
initializing audio recorder and in here
I will say audio recorder delegate is
equal to self so this means that audio
recorders new delegate is self or our
class record sounds view controller now
that I've finished both of these steps I
can start typing audio recorder did
finish recording and as soon as I type
that Xcode autocompletes it for me now
this method will be invoked when the
audio has finished recording I will
start writing code here soon but before
we continue let me connect some of the
new ideas we've seen recently one of the
classes we've been using is called a V
audio recorder now this class was
written by Apple among other things it
has a variable defined in it called
delegate now the type of this variable
is not a string not an integer but is
something called a V audio recorder
delegate what this is is a simple list
of methods one of which is called audio
recorder did finish recording so in our
class which is record sounds view
controller when we see a line of code
like this what we are really saying is
that we are becoming audio recorders
delegate and at that point we can
implement all of these methods by the
way don't take my word for any of this
you can go back to Xcode and use the
command key on your keyboard to look
through a via audio recorder and confirm
this relationship once you've done that
I encourage you to come back to this
quiz and summarize everything you've
learned about delegates in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
