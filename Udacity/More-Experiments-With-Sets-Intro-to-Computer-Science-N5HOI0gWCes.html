would just be to do that experiment
let's try creating a set from the list
where the element is the value 101
that's the number and that works ok
we'll do the second example as well also
works ok now we'll try the third one
where the element of the set is itself a
set and now we get an error except for I
get a different error than I expected
which is that I called set here with
three arguments and it expected at most
one so let's try that again I need to
make a list of 123 as my set element and
now I get a different kind of type error
this is that I've tried to use an
unhackable type set as an element of my
set and we can see that sets are
unhatched ball another way to see that
would be use the built-in hash operator
hash takes an object maps at an integer
for an integer hash maps 10 12 101 if we
hash hash browns we get this big integer
if we have some other string we get a
different one there would be some other
strings that would hatch to the same
value but it shouldn't be too easy to
find them but when we do a hash on a set
begin an error because it's uh none
hashable type it has no way to compute
hash and since the value of the set
commute eight it will be dangerous to
use them in a dictionary or in a set
itself which is why we're not actually
allowed to do that the other two
examples we had at uppal which works ok
at uppal itself is immutable and we can
see that T prints out as at uppal we can
access elements of it just like we could
in a list but we can't do assignment
as we saw with sets well that's not
enough to know that it's immutable
because set also doesn't allow item
assignment but is mutable the final one
we had was set where the element is set
itself that's okay and we can see it
prints out telling us well what set
means here is the type set type is an
object we haven't talked about types in
a formal way in 101 there are very
important part of understanding Python
programs as you get to be a more
advanced programmer everything in python
has a type we can see that type by using
type so the type of a number is integer
the type of the string is the type
string abbreviated STR and the type of
the result of set is a set the type of
set is the type type because set itself
is a type and that's the type that set
has things can get pretty confusing and
we're getting a little bit sidetracked
so I'm going to go back to the question
that we started with of figuring out
what we can do with sets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
