encounter JSON data is through the use
of a web service a web service is
essentially a database that you can
access using HTTP requests with a web
service you formulate queries as URLs so
I'd like to take a look at a simple
example using the musicbrainz org site
the nice thing about this site is that
we don't need an API key so it will be
very easy for you to experiment with the
code I'm gonna give you okay musicbrainz
is essentially a wiki but one that
provides a web service with access to
their data the type of data musicbrainz
maintains is metadata on music so we can
ask questions about artists labels
recordings etc now the way that we query
this site is by constructing a URL that
has musicbrainz that org as a base but
then specifies a particular entity the
type of data we're interested in getting
back and we can specify some additional
parameters that allow us to be specific
about exactly what features or what
metadata we'd like to get back for a
given entity so say for an artist now
one thing that we're going to have to do
in order to use this site is if we want
to get specific information about an
artist we actually need to know its
unique identifier that is the
musicbrainz unique identifier and this
theme of unique identifiers is something
that's going to come up over and over
and over again in this course in a
variety of different ways so the first
thing we're going to do is actually use
their search interface and we're just
going to pass in a query that includes
some search term for the artist we're
interested in finding information about
we're gonna process the results that
come back from that query in order to
get the ID for that particular artist
and then we can request information
about a specific artist using that ID
now lest you think I'm a one-trick pony
we're actually going to ask for data for
a different artist in this case Lucero
so here's where we're doing our first
query and this is going to give us back
a result set now we're going to process
that result set in order to get back the
ID for Lucero
the musicbrainz ID for Lucero now I'm
not going to go into this in too much
detail but something I want to point out
here is that what's happening is when we
issue this query the response we get
back is JSON data using the JSON module
in Python
we can read in that data and it will
simply be translated into the
appropriate Python objects now a JSON
object is equivalent to a Python
dictionary
so what we're accessing right here is
that Python dictionary and we're going
to access the artists field of that
dictionary that field happens to have an
array as its value and I happen to know
that the second object in that array is
the one I'm actually interested in the
band lucero from memphis okay now we
want the ID for this particular artist
the value of an artist is another object
it was a JSON object and the results we
got back from musicbrainz in our case
because we're working in Python the JSON
module has translated it into another
Python dictionary so the ID field
contains the value we're actually
interested in getting here okay then
what we're going to do is query the site
again this time specifically requesting
information on this particular ID the ID
that we got back from our first query
well I should say from processing our
first query all right so then we're
going to issue this second query we're
actually going to ask for releases and
you can look above in the code here to
see what's going on here essentially
what I've done is implemented some
convenience code that allows us to
easily pass in the parameters that
musicbrainz is expecting in order to get
their releases data back okay and then
the rest of this is simply printing out
the results so let's take a look at what
the results look like so here's the
result of having dived into the results
set from that first query to get the
artists we're interested in okay here's
the ID we care about and then if we look
down a couple of things I want to point
out here I've set up this code so that
each time it makes a request out to this
web service it prints out the URL all
right again remember that URL is how we
specify our query to a web service so
musicbrainz org I'm specifying that I
want to access the web service version
two of the web service I believe at
least that's what this two means and
then I'm saying the entity I'm
interested in is artists and here's the
ID for that artist now what I want you
to do is give me back data that's
formatted as JSON and this particular
parameter for musicbrainz is where we
specify exactly what
we'd like to receive in response it's
kind of a catch-all for everything if we
want more than one type of metadata we
simply concatenate them together here in
this case I'm just interested in
releases okay so then what I did in the
code was I actually processed the
response that I got back to this query
to pull out the very first release okay
and here is the object in Python it's
going to be a dictionary that represents
or that stores the data for that first
release this happens to be a release
entitled 2012 420 Webster Hall in New
York as it turns out I was actually at
this show my wife had surprised me by
flying in my best friend who's also a
big Lucero fan okay so then what I did
was in here I used a list comprehension
to process all of the releases and
extract just the title for each one of
those releases and then I'm simply
printing them all out here so what I
encourage you to do with this code is
take a look at all of it get a sense for
how it works and then experiment on your
own with some queries you can look for
different artists you can use some of
the conveniences that we've provided
here to query for different types of
metadata about a given artist okay so
just play with this part of the code or
work with Python in the Python
interpreter and just get a sense for the
data that's here but I really encourage
you to do is print out the full result
set dive in to exactly what type of data
is coming back it's all just
hierarchical data structure that has
objects or arrays nested within other
objects or arrays following this we'll
have a quiz where we actually ask you to
answer some specific questions so you
will have to be able to query this web
service correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
