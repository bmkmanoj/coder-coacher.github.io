population faced with a malaria epidemic
which is definitely very scary for
everyone involved luckily we're here to
help them out in order to slow the
spread of the disease we're going to
make people start using mosquito nets in
their houses they can avoid being bitten
as often we're going to introduce the
nuts after 100 days and they immediately
decrease the probability of a person
getting bitten by ninety percent as we
can see from the constant that we've
defined right here called bite reduction
by net bytes per day and mosquito tells
us that every person gets bitten by each
mosquito point 1 times per day now with
a mosquito bites a human there's a
chance of two different things happening
that are of particular interest to us
now the mosquito has malaria it can give
a disease to the human or if a human has
malaria then he or she can give it to
the mosquito the probability of either
of these things happening is shown right
here once in fact it takes a human
approximately 70 days to recover at this
point it's important to notice that
mosquitoes only live for 10 days clearly
humans also have a finite lifetime but
compared to mosquitoes we minded will be
immortal even if we do end up with
malaria so that's what we're going to
pretend for the purposes of this problem
and we can model a scenario like this
you need to separate bubble diagrams one
for the mosquito population and one for
the human population the mosquito
lifecycle is kind of a sad one as soon
as they are born they fall into the S
part of the population the susceptible
part from here they can become infected
and then eventually they die there's no
option for them to become susceptible
again a couple of other things to keep
in mind about mosquitoes for one thing
they can't get malaria until after
they're born second only female
mosquitoes can transmit malaria so just
pretend that all the mosquitoes that
we're talking about in this problem are
female now this problem requires you to
take into account all the factors
affecting the infected population and to
include them using the forward Euler
method think critically keep track of
your units and good luck if you have any
trouble at all visit the forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
