teacher why should you give your time to
Startup Weekend and these entrepreneurs
well number one we think you'll learn a
tremendous amount yourself in just
watching a variety of teams start with
an idea and watch their process and you
as a facilitator will actually watch
your skills rise as you're able to see
patterns you've never seen before
you will gain a deep understanding of
the lean launchpad curriculum that is
you'll understand business model
designed you'll understand all the
components of the business model canvas
and understand the startup is not just a
bunch of teams who have free food and
going to bring your dogs to work and
work incredibly hard you'll understand
that there's actually a pattern here and
the pattern is not only the strategy the
canvas but the process of getting out of
the building talking to customers and
understanding iterations and pivots and
no one to do that you will get thinner
tip skills that will be immensely
valuable in your own career and then we
think that being part of an organization
bringing the democratization of
entrepreneurship to a thousand cities
worldwide means you're part of something
bigger now you're becoming a part of a
community and a leader and a role model
for the startup community in your city
in your country you have an incredibly
important role and I think you
understand that the Startup Weekend
program is an important part of the
ecosystem in your city and potentially
your country it is the catalyst in
bringing entrepreneurs together and give
them them a set of skills that can never
acquire elsewhere and you are that
leader so I want to personally thank you
for dedicating your time to something we
all believe is so incredibly important
this entrepreneurship this education
this lean launchpad the Startup Weekend
and Udacity is all part of a global
movement that's truly impacting the
world I'm really really impressed that
all of you have decided to participate
and give all you have and so thank you
from the bottom of my heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
