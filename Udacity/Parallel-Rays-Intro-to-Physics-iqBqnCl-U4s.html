circumference of the earth our
calculation was based entirely on the
assumption that the sun's rays struck
Alexandria and CNA parallel
let's examine just how true or how good
that assumption was now the drawing F
drawn here is totally out of scale after
on the earth huge and only a section of
it John the son of certainly tiny and
much much too close to earth for the
sake of the geometry this picture will
work now we know that the distance from
the earth to the Sun is about 150
million kilometers Eratosthenes knew
that the distance from CNA to Alexandria
this distance was about five thousand
stadia and remember one Stadion is equal
to about 185 meters I want to know
what's this angle the reason why I want
to know what this angle is it's because
this angle somehow quantifies how
parallel these lines are if they're
truly parallel well this thing would be
zero degrees this line be coming in at
the exact same orientation as this line
any deviation from zero represents some
error and we want to make sure that if
it does deviate from zero that it's
still quite a small number so for this
problem you're going to want to assume
that this is a right triangle even
though it doesn't quite look like one if
we drew this more to scale you would see
that it truly it's very close to being a
right triangle and so we can still use
our trigonometry so using the fact that
this distance is 150 million kilometers
which you could say is the length of
this leg here if you like or that leg
since these are equal and you know this
length is five thousand stadia can you
tell me what's this angle and we'll call
this angle alpha and give your answer in
degrees and for this problem I actually
want you to round to five decimal places</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
