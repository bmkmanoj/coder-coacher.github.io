in mat set I pulled out one more Clause
this is the clause for a sequence and
this is what we return if i want to
write the compiler for that sequence
clause i would say let's define sequence
of XY it's a compiler so it's going to
return a function that operates on x and
y takes as input a text and then returns
the result and we could take exactly
that result while i'm moving everything
to this more functional notation I
decided let's just show you a different
way to do this this would this way to do
it would be fine I could have the
function return that but instead let's
have it say well what we're really
trying to do is form a union of stats
and what are the sets the sets that
we're going to apply Union to first
reply x to the text and that's going to
give us a set of remainders and for each
of the remainders we want to apply why
to it so what we're saying is we're
going to map why to each set of
remainders and then we want a union all
those together now Union it turns out
doesn't take a collection it takes
arguments for union ABC and so we want
to turn this collection into a list of
arguments to Union and so we do that
using this apply notation of saying
let's just put a star in there and now
we've got our compiler for sequence it's
the function from text to the set that
results from finding all the remainders
for X and then finding all the
remainders from each of those after we
apply y and union all those together and
the union will eliminate duplicates now
it's your turn to do one this was the
definition of alt in the interpreter mat
set now I want you to write the
definition of the compiler for alt take
a pattern for XY and return the function
that implements that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
