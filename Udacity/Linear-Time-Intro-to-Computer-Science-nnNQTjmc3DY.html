which of the procedures run in linear
time that is the running time scales
linearly with the length of the input
what we need to make sure is that there
aren't too many steps if we have a look
at the first procedure we initialize a
variable that's just doesn't take very
much time and then we have a for loop
and the for loop iterates through the
input list here and so if nothing
happens in here then it will iterate
through input list times so in order for
it to be linear the steps within the for
loop must be in constant time and so
what are we doing we're just comparing
the variable maximum with an element and
then if the comparison is true then
we're setting maximum to be the element
this is just looking for the maximum
element in the list and that's just a
constant time operation there and so
that is constant time so procedure one
does run in linear time now on to our
second procedure what's it doing its
taking the first element of the input
list and adding it on to some so it
starts at some starts at zero and then
add the first element of the input list
and then the input list is set to be the
second element onwards in the list and
then it keeps some ink now how many
steps does this take when it just cuts
off the first element each time in the
list that's the one that we've already
added on and then the list continues as
long as it's not empty and so this is
actually performed the length of the
input list times one thing we always
need to look at when we're doing this is
to check whether their constant time and
you're told in the question
that both of these are constant time
which means that the whole procedure
runs in linear time now onto procedure
three what it's doing is running through
the list checking each element against
every other element and if you're not
checking an element against itself and
the two elements are the same then
return false and otherwise return true
so it's checking whether there's a
repeated element in the list now looking
at how it's done it this inner loop here
runs through all the values of j in the
worst case when the input list of i is
never equal to the input list j when I
and J are different this will run
through the whole list this is going to
go through length of input list times in
the worst case so the inner loop for J
that's going to go through that many
times now it's going to go through that
many times when I equals 0 and when I
equals 1 and when I equals 2 and so on
so it's actually going to go through
that inner loop length of input x and
that's squared and if it's something
squared it's no longer linear so this is
not linear time so the correct answer
was procedures 1 and 2 run in linear
time with respect to the length of the
input list and procedure 3 does not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
