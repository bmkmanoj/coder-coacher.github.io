to conduct our investigation sometimes
this will be highly specified and may
even come to you from a colleague or
perhaps a supervisor often however we
start with a vague direction we want to
investigate and it is our job to refine
this into something we can answer let's
start by asking the high-level question
how popular were the different kinds of
candy
note that this question cannot be
answered in the way that it is phrased
we have no meaningful description of
popular much less a way to say that one
candy is more popular than another to
get the iterations of analysis going our
task is to refine this initial question
until it is cast in the form of a
precise statistical inference problem to
do this we will first need to make a
guess as to how to quantify popularity
so how would you quantify popularity
what metrics would you use type your
answer and the text below don't worry
there are no right or wrong answers and
I will share my answer with you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
