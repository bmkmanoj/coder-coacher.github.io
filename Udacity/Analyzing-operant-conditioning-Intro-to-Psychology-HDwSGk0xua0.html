determining whether something is
reinforcement or punishment or positive
reinforcement or negative reinforcement
the first the easiest thing to do is to
say does the behavior increase if the
behavior increases its reinforcement if
the behavior decreases its punishment
after you decide that then go back and
look to the behavior increase because
something was added to the environment
if so that's positive reinforcement or
did the behavior increase because
something was taken away from the
environment if so that's negative
reinforcement and the same for
punishment if behavior decreases did it
decrease because something was added to
the environment for example a painful
shock that would be positive punishment
and removing something from the
environment and behavior decreasing
would be negative punishment so first
asked his behavior increase or decrease
and then ask did it happen because
something was added to the environment
or taken away you can use this when
you're going through the problem sets
but I encourage you to look at your own
life and see examples of positive and
negative punishment and positive and
negative reinforcement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
