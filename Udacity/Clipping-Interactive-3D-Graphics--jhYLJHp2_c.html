projection and before division by W
clipping say we have two points zero
four negative six
after perspective transformation that
turns into zero four five six and zero
six negative four which turns into this
value they form a line segment these two
points in this line segment are shown
and this zoomed in part of our frustum
the second point is outside of the
frustum we want to have all coordinates
inside our final view volume in NDC
space so that we can render them
clipping is done for line segments and
triangle edges that poke out through the
frustum an edge can be clipped by any
number of phases of the frustum what
happens here is that all the coordinates
between the two points get linearly
interpolated for our example the point
on the frustum face is halfway between
our two points the interpolated point is
then zero 53.85 we then divide this
point by W as usual to get a point in
normalized device coordinates here's a
rough overview of how clipping can work
you start with the triangle that's
poking out through the frustum say the
left face of the frustum first cuts the
triangle this creates two triangles
later the top face of the frustum chops
off the other part of the triangle this
creates three triangles total that will
then be rasterized separately by the GPU
you as a user don't really have to know
or care much about this clipping process
it happens automatically it's worth
knowing about mostly if you need to do
similar testing operations on the CPU
side in computer graphics we often make
a big deal about how we store 3d points
and vectors as homogeneous coordinates
with the fourth element W in reality for
almost every operation the W value is
either zero meaning a vector or one
meaning a point it's only after
projection and during clipping that the
W value is anything but one once cooking
is done and we're using normalized
device coordinates we're done with
homogeneous coordinates however these
homogeneous coordinates are important
and that they're what the vertex shader
produces when the coordinate is
transformed by the projection matrix but
before the division is performed the
coordinates are called clip coordinates
the vertex shader can produce other
intermediate results such as computing
location once the model and view
matrices are applied it is required that
the vertex shader produce a position on
the screen for the vertex this position
is a homogeneous coordinate the
rasterizer then takes this position and
performs
