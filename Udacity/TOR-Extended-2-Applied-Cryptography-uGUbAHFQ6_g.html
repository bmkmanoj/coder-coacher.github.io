fourth options the first one is not an
issue because the circuit identifiers
are remapped in between each Onion
Router and so there's no way for the
beginning and ends onion routers to
collude the second statement is an issue
in section 7 of tour the
second-generation Onion Router paper the
authors discuss this issue when talking
about end-to-end timing attacks and
introducing timing into messages the
third item is not an issue different
keys are used between each router so
there is no way for a malicious router
to identify and associate a key with
Alice this fourth item is an issue to
see this let's take this example network
between a and B and we've chosen a
circuit in red an attacker could try
introducing congestion on each
connection for example here and see if
it causes any disruption on the flow of
packets and to be in this case it won't
and so the attacker has learned this
connection is not involved you try here
and observe and you should see
disruption of packets into B and the
attacker has learned that these two
onion routers are on the circuit you can
continue on to do this on all the
connections and learn which onion
routers are involved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
