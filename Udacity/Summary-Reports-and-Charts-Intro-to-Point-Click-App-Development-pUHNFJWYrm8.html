we can go to create a dashboard off of
it okay how do I do that so if you go
back to the top one of the tabs is
dashboards so we're going to want to
create a new dashboard and a dashboard
itself is a layout for a bunch of
different dashboard components and so
the report that we just made is going to
create one dashboard component which is
one gauge chart and dashboards can be a
culmination of you know several
dashboard components you can see
snapshots of a bunch of different stuff
at once and if I my intuition is right
yeah intuition that's the word I'm gonna
drag some things yeah so drop that guy
in looks just like little odometer or
engage drag a data source here okay so
the report that we created as a data
source there are a couple different data
sources you can create but that's the
easiest one to make which is point &amp;amp;
click so I'm going to click data source
open reports my personal customer ports
oh wow this is actually really easy this
is exciting yeah I know the anticipation
is killing me hey cool all right so I
obviously want to change some of these
things i want to send some milestones or
something so what should we do so the
first thing that we need to do is scroll
up and click the wrench oh yeah always
the wrench so what we're doing is
setting the different areas of the gauge
chart so it shows red yellow and Granger
so what's our goal Andy for the event um
well we've kind of making this up let's
say the goal is two hundred thousand
dollars sounds good since the net let's
well that'll be the yellow to green
threshold let's say so that way then if
we make more than that we can still see
it go beyond that I don't make this one
300,000 okay and so then that red would
be 100,000 yep oh cool so usually these
thresholds would be based off of real
metrics in this case we just made it up
but you can see where the progress is on
the right and there's actually it turns
it into a smaller number in order to
make it fit and so it says 100 200 300
you can see the sum of the total spent
is really in a thousand now if you go to
the component data you can change
how it's showing this gauge I could do
whole units within it overlaps and it
looks crappy so we'll do I like
thousands was fine thousands looks good
you can also change the value so maybe
you don't want to track the actual total
spent maybe you just want to spend see
how many different records there were if
you I mean we don't in this case but I'm
just saying like there there are options
here for you to be able to work with the
same report but display different data
okay cool and so let's pretend if this
were a real festival the this first
threshold 100,000 would be like that's
your cost it's just recuperating your
costs maybe two hundred thousands your
goal and then that's bonus or something
but really immediately we see off of
those like couple hundred records hey we
have a lot more to go before we hit our
goal okay that's very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
