that if we knew it would make it
relatively straightforward to figure out
you know what new state we were in
well if we knew its state we were in
before hmm since we have a transition
model we know which states we were are
likely to be in next yeah okay well let
me let's let's just write that that's it
that's a really good start so what we're
saying is let's break things down by the
possible state that we started in and
what we want to know and we're gonna
wait things by what's the probability
that that's the state we started in
given be a Z then given that what's the
probability of the next state given that
state so this is going to help us break
things down successfully so let's see if
we can do that so what do we know about
the probability of being in a state
given belief state that we took an
action and we made some observation so I
think that the thing to point out here
is that the observation that we're going
to that we saw is generated by the state
that we ended up in and so we're
actually trying to figure out what state
we were in based on the observation we
got when in fact the generative model
goes the other way so this is a prime
situation to try to use Bayes rule it's
an S prime situation for using Bayes
rule so that gives us the probability of
making observation given the state that
we're in or that we arrived in s prime
and carrying over the a and the s and
the probability that that's the state we
ended in given a and s divided by the
normalization factor the probability of
the observation given a and s right all
right so now we're getting really close
to two quantities that we recognize in
particular the probability of an
observation given the state that we just
landed in is independent of the action
and the state that we that we just took
so this is going to be the observation
function this right here is the
transition function the probability of
landing in some state s prime given that
we were in state s and took action a and
then this is just going to be a
normalization factor at the bottom right
so substituting those quantities in and
rewriting out this normalization factor
is a basically the numerator divided by
the sum of all the possible next States
s prime we get one component of the new
belief state P prime if we apply the
same idea over all possible states s
prime then we get probability
distribution over all the states that
represents
the likelihood of being in those states
given that we were in belief state B
took action a and made observations e
yeah so that's intuitively obvious even
to the most casual observer but more
importantly it just uses all the
quantities we already had it does it
seems like sort of you know like when a
TV series is over and they bring all the
characters back for one last show it's
like you know we got the B back and the
Oh back and the C back everybody's
everybody's friends again and it smells
bought and so my point is that this
these quantities can be easily
calculated from or sorry this this
quantity this B prime is prime can be
easily calculated from quantities that
we have lying around because we have the
model the palm DP and we know what the
previous belief state is and we know
what action we just took and what
observation we made and so all this can
be updated and so we can keep track of
kind of this notion of where we are this
belief state notion of the belief MDP I
like it cool all right
so this doesn't actually tell us how to
do decision-making because all we've
what we've done actually it's we turn to
Palm DP into an MDP that by the way has
an infinite number of states so we can't
we you know we have a number of
algorithms that we can run like linear
programming or policy iteration or value
iteration and they all at best grow
polynomial in the number of states so
it's polynomial in infinity so infinity
was a constant ya know it's bigger than
any constant so this is this is
problematic we can't just take this MVP
now that we've defined it and just solve
it using our existing algorithms we're
gonna have to be a little bit more
careful and so I want to step through
the algorithmic process for how you can
actually do that it's uh it's it's kind
of nice I think okay
I mean I can't wait to say you make
infinity affinity so it's doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
