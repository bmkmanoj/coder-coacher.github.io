but I think it's also quite fun actually
to play around with these ideas here
this pre-processing rule here is
actually correct and the reason is the
following so you have this vertex here
and it has just one neighbor so you have
this edge here we already know either
this vertex has to be in the vertex
cover or this one because otherwise this
edge here would not be covered now
taking both is clearly a waste you
wouldn't want to do that because once
you have put this one here into the
vertex cover you do not need to put that
one into the vertex cover but if you
know that you only need to put one of
the two vertices into the vertex cover
well in that case it's always better to
put this one here into the vertex cover
because it will not only cover this edge
but also some additional edges and in
this case here you've basically paid one
vertex but you only get to cover one
edge so it's always better to use this
one in that case which also means that
this rule here is not correct now what
about this case over here now what about
this case over here you might be
inclined to think that this is the same
case so that instead of using this
vertex here it's always better to put
these two into the vertex cover but
unfortunately that is not the case and I
will give you a very simple example of
this so if you have graph that looks
like this for example you look at it
this way that this part here is the same
as this part here then you can see that
if you put these two vertices into a
vertex cover then you need an additional
two vertices and it can be either one of
those or either one of those but you
need two more to cover the whole graph
so this would give you a solution of
size 4 but actually this graph has a
vertex cover of size 3 if you use this
one here then this one and this one then
you have a size 3 solution this is not a
correct rule because it can lead us to
find a sub optimal solution so you have
to be careful with pre-processing rules
as useful as they are but actually just
having this one rule over here is
already pretty cool because what does it
tell us well once we have a vertex with
one neighbor such as this one here we'll
put that one into the vertex cover and
we also know that we do not need to put
this one here into the vertex cover and
this will now help us to improve our
search tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
