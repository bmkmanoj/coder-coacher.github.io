figuring out how strong this force F has
to be to keep this trolley which has a
mass of 1,000 kilograms moving at a
constant rate up this incline of 10
degrees so the first thing I want to do
here is diagram all the forces that are
acting on the trolley and there are
three forces acting on our trolley
there's this force F which corresponds
to the road pushing the trolley up the
hill there's the normal force acting
perpendicular to the slope and there's
the force of gravity which points
straight down and as we've done in the
past we can break down the force of
gravity into components that are
parallel to the incline and
perpendicular to the incline and you
remember that this angle here is the
same as this angle here so they're both
10 degrees all right now we know that we
want this trolley to move at a constant
velocity which means that it can't be
accelerating so acceleration has to be 0
and if it's not accelerating that means
there can't be any net force acting on
the trolley so the net force also has to
be equal to 0 and if the net force is
equal to 0 that means all of these
forces perfectly balanced each other out
so let's look at the perpendicular
Direction first so there's some
component of the force of gravity acting
perpendicular to the incline but we
don't need to worry about that since we
know that's going to be perfectly
balanced out by the normal force here we
also know that this force F has to
exactly equal the component of gravity
that's parallel to the incline that
gives us this equation here now using
some trigonometry I know that F is equal
to the full force of gravity times the
sine of 10 degrees and of course the
force of gravity is just equal to mg and
plugging in numbers here I find that the
force F required to keep the trolley
moving at a constant velocity is equal
to 1736 Newtons great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
