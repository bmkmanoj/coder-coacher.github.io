result in different traits like for
example you have blue eyes and I have
brown right so obviously not everyone
has the same genetic sequence for every
gene the stuff that codes for us now in
the example of eye color the eye color
gene can come in different versions now
in genetics we have a word for this and
it's called an allele so you could have
the sequence that codes for brown eyes
and we would call that the brown allele
or the brown version alternatively you
could have the sequence that codes for
blue eyes we call this the blue allele
or the blue version of the gene now if
we carry this out and in experiment like
a thought experiment where you get one
brown allele from one parent and another
Brown allele from another parent what
color eyes do you think the children are
going to have brown right they're going
to have brown so it's pretty simple we
could also do the same experiment with
the blue alleles if you get one blue
allele from mom and one blue allele from
dad what color eyes do you think you're
going to have but you're going to have
blue but it gets interesting when we
have to figure out what happens in the
mixed situation where you get a brown
allele from one parent and a blue allele
from another parent in this case what
color eyes do you think the children are
going to have I don't know why don't you
answer this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
