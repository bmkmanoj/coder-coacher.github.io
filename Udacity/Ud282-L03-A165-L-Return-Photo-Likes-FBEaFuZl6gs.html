outside function definitions like we
want to do with the value of current
likes I'll have to do two things the
first thing is I'll have to change the
return type which is now void to the
output type I expect to be returned and
return types are just types of variables
strings integers doubles and so on in
this case we know you want to return our
current likes variable which is an int
value so we'll change the return type
from void to int the second thing we
need to do is to return the value of the
end of our current likes in a return
statement and the return statement is
just a line of code at the end of a
function definition that says return
followed by the value you want to output
in this case that's the value of current
likes so our return statement is just
return current likes followed by a
semicolon now because I've included the
correct return type and a return
statement when I call this function it
will output the value of current likes
and we'll be able to use this output
value in other function calls so here's
our function call from before that adds
to the initial zero value of our current
likes since our boolean like argument is
true so this function call will increase
our current initial likes from zero to
one and it will also return this value
and I can now store the return to output
of this function call as an int variable
which I'll call returned lakes so this
function call outputs the value 1 and
then I can store that in a variable and
now the output of like photo gives us
access to the return value of current
likes and once we've stored this output
in a variable I can use it just like I
would any other int variable and this
goes for any function that returns a
value like this the function call should
be used in the same way that its return
type is used and for like photo I can
use this returned in value which is
equal to 1 in this case to automatically
keep track of the likes of photo gets
so for our second function call instead
of typing in zr or one for our current
likes i can just pass in the returned
likes and it will keep track of the
likes no matter what the value of our
first function call outputs and actually
now every call to like photo will return
the latest number of likes so this
second call will return an updated
number of current likes and i'll store
that in another variable which i'll call
into total likes so let's see how this
works when our first call has a true
boolean like argument value the returned
likes will be equal to one and this
value will be passed into our second
function call our second function call
also has a boolean value true here so it
will increase its current likes argument
by one and we expect a total value of
two to be returned so our first function
call returns a value of one current like
and our second returns a value of two
which is correct but if the first call
has its boolean like value set to false
the returned likes will be equal to zero
our second call still has a boolean
value of true so it should increase the
return likes by one so this time after
our first function call the returned
likes are 0 and after our second
function call our total likes are 1 and
that's correct
the total likes are correct each time
and we didn't have to change anything
about our second function call at all
so making functions that return data is
really useful when you want to use that
return value in another program or
function call instead of just printing
it out to the screen let's get more
practice recognizing and writing return
statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
