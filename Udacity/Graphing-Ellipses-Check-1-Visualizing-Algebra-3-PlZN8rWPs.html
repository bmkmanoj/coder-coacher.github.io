origin and were to have an a value of
six and it would have a B value of four
great thinking if you got each of these
correct we know the centre is zero zero
since this fits the general formula for
our ellipse there's no number next to
the X inside parentheses and there's no
number next to the Y inside of
parentheses so we know our ellipse is
centered at 0 0 to find the a value we
want to take the square root of this
denominator of 36 and the square root of
thirty-six equals 6 which means we go
six units in the left direction and in
the right direction remember the a term
indicates which way we move in the X
direction since the a number is directly
underneath the x squared term for B we
just need to take the square root of
sixteen which equals four so to get two
other points on our lips we move four
units up from the center and four units
down from the center this gives us four
easily identifiable points and then we
can connect our lips remember that this
was our general formula for an ellipse
centered at the origin so we need to
find the square root of thirty-six and
the square root of sixteen I think it's
always more helpful to write these as
perfect squares if you can comparing the
equations like this we can quickly see
that the value of a equals six and the
value of B equals four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
