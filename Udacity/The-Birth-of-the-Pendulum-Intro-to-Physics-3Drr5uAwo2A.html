staring at this pendulum I mean
chandelier as it rocks back and forth
this is a chandelier these are candles
if you ever want to teach and try to
drawing i would be happy in fact
thrilled to take that class and here he
is measuring his pulse with this fingers
up against his neck and he finds that
what do you know the chandelier is
swinging periodically it takes the same
amount of time every single time it
swings back and forth this gave Galileo
an idea Galileo realize the potential
here this could possibly be used as a
timekeeping device and solve once and
for all the problem of longitude but it
wasn't Galileo's bright idea that caused
the birth of the pendulum it was the
equally bright but apparently more
energy-efficient idea of Christian
Huygens that actually led to the birth
of the pendulum why don't we talk to add
mas the curator of the museum Bora hava
in Leiden to get a bit more perspective
on this Christian I which is mainly
known for his role in what is called the
Scientific Revolution for example his
work is cutting-edge work on the
pendulum motion was combined with
thinking about making precise steady
clockworks making steady clocks had all
had to do with being able to navigate at
sea the only way to be able to determine
your longitude is if you would be able
to compare your time on your ship with
the time of your starting point and in
order to keep the time of your starting
point you need a very steady clockwork
well that was a big challenge for
inventors throughout the 70 and almost
thought of the 18th century</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
