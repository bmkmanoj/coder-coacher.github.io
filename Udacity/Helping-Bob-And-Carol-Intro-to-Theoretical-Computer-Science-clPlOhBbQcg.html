better search tree for Bob and Carol as
well so that they also can look happy so
as you remember bob was working on the
clique problem finding a set of vertices
in a graph that all were connected as
much as possible so I set something like
this all vertices are connected to all
other vertices and carol was looking for
the opposite thing so a number of
vertices that were not connected to each
other at all in a network so going to
draw this dashed line here to show that
there is no connection we're actually
going just to look at independent set
because as you'll remember clique and
independent set are so closely connected
that it's actually once you have an
algorithm for independent set it's not
that difficult to design a very similar
algorithm for click you can basically
use the same techniques so in order to
design a good search tree for Carol how
do we design this actually it's quite
similar to vertex cover so remember how
we defined an independent set and an
independent set no two vertices can be
connected to each other we can actually
play the same game that we played for
vertex cover in a search tree so let's
say you have two vertices and we're
going to call this one here d and this
one you and the two vertices are
connected by an edge and we're now
trying to assign values of 0 and 1 to
those vertices so 1 and 0 here 1 and 0
here same as for vertex cover only this
time we are looking at assignments that
would be valid for independent set as
opposed to vertex cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
