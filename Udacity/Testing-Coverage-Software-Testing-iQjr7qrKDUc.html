we're gonna take a really short quiz the
quiz is gonna have two parts both of
which stem from a little statistics
module that we have here function stats
is defined to take a list of inputs and
what the function does is computes the
smallest element in the list the largest
element in the list
the median element of the list that is
to say if we order the list numerically
the middle element or the average of the
two middle elements if the list has an
even number of elements and finally it
computes the mode of the list where the
mode is the element which occurs the
most frequently in the list in the case
where the list is bimodal meaning it has
two modes or multimodal more than two
modes it will print all of them what I'm
gonna do here is test the stats function
extremely badly so I'm going to create a
list containing only the number 31 and
I'm gonna call stats on the list and so
let's look at the coverage that we get
we can see here that even my fairly bad
test managed to cover 29 statements in
the stats function but three statements
aren't covered and they're shown right
here your assignment for the first part
of this API quiz is to write a
collection of test cases for it that
achieves 100% statement coverage what I
mean by that specifically is that your
job is to construct to several lists
call stats on them and cover all
statements but I'd like you to do is
think about it a little bit try to
visualize the effect that your inputs
are having on the code try to come up
with a collection of inputs that gets
full statement coverage on the first try
but then of course check your answer
using the coverage tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
