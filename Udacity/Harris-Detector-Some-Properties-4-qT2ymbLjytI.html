invariant to image scale that is now the
object has different scales in the
multiple images this can be looked at by
again just taking a simple example like
this so I have two objects here or twos
you know elements as you can notice both
of them are the same except this is much
smaller and this is much larger now here
what becomes interesting is what
resolution am I looking at information
so for example if I'm looking this is
the size of the window I'm looking at
and this is the size of the window I'm
looking at well nothing directly would
compare to those and depending again
what aspects of these regions am I kind
of scaling and observing I would have
problems with this this of course would
be a perfect match at just this size and
there is no similarity at this window
for this whole region but as I said this
basically is the same object just scaled
up so what I would need is a different
size this of course in this detector
will be a corner this will not be at
this window size detected as a corner in
fact they will all be listed as edges as
you'd expect so of course this suggests
that Harris detector is not invariant to
image scale so what can we do about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
