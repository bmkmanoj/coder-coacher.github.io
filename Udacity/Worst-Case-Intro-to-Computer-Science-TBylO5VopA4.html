analyze programs is what's called the
worst case execution time and that's the
case where the input for a given size
takes the longest possible time to run
so for our lookup the worst case will be
either the very last entry in the table
or an a keyword that doesn't exist in
the table at all let's look at the code
for lookup to understand more why the
timescales the way it does and think
about what the worst case execution time
and what the average case will be so to
get a better understanding of the
results we've seen let's look at the
code that we wrote for the index this is
the code that we finished in the last
unit and we have the code for lookup
so what lookup is doing it's going
through a loop each of the entries in
the index and remember that index is a
list so it's going through that list for
each element it's checking does it match
the keyword so this is our index
structure right it's a list of elements
if we had 10 million of them it's a very
long list with lots of elements but each
element is a list itself where we have
keyword followed by the list of URLs
where it appears and what lookup is
doing is going through those entries the
number of times we go through this loop
depends on the size of the index the
size of the index is the maximum number
of times through that loop and it also
depends on well if we find the keyword
early then we're done
the other code that you see here that's
relevant to this is the code for add to
index and the reason that's relevant is
we want to know what the structure of
the index is after we made our big index
and what abdun index does is also loop
through all the entries to find if one
already exists then it adds that URL if
one doesn't exist it adds the new entry
at the end so this means that the first
entry we add will always be at the
beginning that's why the a with it is is
first and the last one that we add will
be at the end so now we'll have a quiz
to see if you understand what it means
to be the worst case input and have the
code for lookup works the question is
which of these inputs will have the
worst-case running time so the choices
are doing lookup passing in the next and
the first word that was added to the
index the second choice is doing lookup
passing an index and a word that is not
in the index and the third choice is
calling lookup passing in the index and
is the second input passing in the last
word that was added to the index so for
the quiz you should check all the
answers that have the worst-case running
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
