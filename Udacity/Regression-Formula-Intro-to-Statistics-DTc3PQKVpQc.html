linear regression and much less
statistics is how to use data to
determine the value of B and the value
of a so if you can do this with data
then we solve the problem of fitting the
best line and let's once again called
linear regression so I won't give you
the derivation but I'll give you the
formula let's start with B assuming your
data comes in pairs for x and y as
indicated here then the formula for B
might look really complex at first but I
promise you it isn't just in the
calculation of the variance you take the
difference between X and the mean of X
but rather than squaring this as in the
variance case you know do a product with
the same term for the Y's so important
here in this notation x-bar is the mean
of the x i's and y bar is the mean of
the Y's previously we would have called
x-bar mu but now that we have two
variables you're going to use the bar
notation let's go back and look at this
formula here when we computed the
variance you would have taken X I minus
X bar to the square but here we're
taking the product of X i minus x bar x
the y direction of the same thing so
it's similar to computing a variance the
last thing we'll do is normalize this
thing before we often Omelas with n but
now we're gonna normalize for something
else we normalize for the term that very
much reminds us of the variance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
