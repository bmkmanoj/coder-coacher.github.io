work specifically we're going to look at
how to synthesize a tcp/ip protocol
stack using this methodology starting
point of course is the i/o automata we
specify the protocol in all the detail
that we want abstractly that's the
abstract specification of the protocol
and we can prove that this abstract
specification meets the properties that
we want in the protocol using the i/o
atamanov framework and from the abstract
specification through a whole bunch of
refinements we can get to the concrete
specification we saw that already those
are the two steps that we already
mentioned how we take in synthesizing
complex software but the next part how
do we synthesize the stack from the
concrete spec or in other words how do
we generate this code the oh camel code
that represents this abstract
specification for the tcp/ip protocol
stack so we need to have a starting
point for that the starting point to get
an unarmed eyes Oh camel implementation
starting from this concrete spec is to
use this ensemble suite of micro
protocols that the authors of this
ensemble paper that I've assigned to you
have synthesized at Cornell why use
ensemble well remember our goal is to
mimic the methodology that is used in
building VLSI large-scale VLSI circuits
I mentioned that the outset that today
building a billion transistors CPU chip
the way it works is they use a component
based design taking components of
Hardware structures that have already
been implemented and assemble them
together in order to realize this big
mammoth chip and we're trying to do the
same thing for building complex software
systems so the starting point has got to
be a set of components and that's what
ensemble suite of micro protocols give
you now if you think about a protocol
like tcp/ip that protocol has a lot of
features in it and each of those
features require
trivial amount of code building so for
instance tcp/ip has mechanisms for
sliding window management flow control
congestion control scattering and
gathering packets in order to assemble
messages into units that can be
delivered to the application all of
these things are features of the tcp/ip
protocol and the ensemble suite of micro
protocols has components for each of
those functionalities that you might
have in any complex transport protocol
like tcp/ip and if you recall the paper
that we read earlier by Tecates and Levy
about optimizing RPC in a local area
network we said that one-size-fits-all
is not a good way to think about
designing complex software systems
depending on what the environment is you
have to adapt what the layers of system
software do and therefore even though
the tcp/ip protocol is well laid out in
terms of what the functional
requirements are whether we need all of
the components in a particular
implementation of tcp/ip or not is
something that is up for the designer to
decide and having a suite of micro
protocols gives you that freedom to mix
and match the components that make sense
in the specific environment for which
you're building a protocol stack and
that's the reason for using the ensemble
suite of micro protocols it has about 60
micro protocols that make up the whole
ensemble suite this field of micro
protocols of ensembles written in a
camel and facilitates component-based
design of a complex system such as
tcp/ip protocol stack and the micro
protocols have well-defined interfaces
that allows composition every micro
protocol has an interface for the layers
that sit on top of it an interface for
interacting with layers that sit below
it and this is exactly the kind of
component that you want so that you can
actually assemble these components layer
by layer in order to get the
functionality that you want for the
original protocol stack that you
intended to build
just to reiterate what we said in the
old as the audit just to reiterate what
we said is the original goal we want to
mimic VLSI design in building a complex
software system and this well-defined
interfaces of the ensemble micro
protocol suite facilitates component
based design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
