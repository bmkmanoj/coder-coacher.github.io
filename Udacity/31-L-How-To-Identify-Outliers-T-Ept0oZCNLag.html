to identify outliers more methodically
rather than simply eyeballing them one
way is a box-and-whisker plot with this
visualization we can make use of the
general rule of thumb that says if a
value is one and a half times the
interquartile range of a data set then
it can be considered an outlier now we
just threw in the mix the term
interquartile range which may not be
familiar to all of us so let's take a
look at what that looks like and means
here we have a simple box and whisker
plot that uses our same income data
example that we built out the histogram
with let's quickly review the components
to this visualization the line in the
middle is the median of your data it's
the midpoint value when you line up all
of your data then we have the two lines
that identify the first and third
quartiles each of these are essentially
the medians of the bottom half and top
half of our data everything in between
shown in the orange box falls into the
interquartile range its value is the
difference between the third quartile
value and the first quartile value and
according to our rule of some definition
if a point is more than one and a half
times the interquartile range above the
third quartile or below the first
quartile we would consider it an outlier
to demonstrate how you would determine
whether or not a value is an outlier
I've included an example in the area
below the video in the case of our data
all of the data except one point appear
in the circle stops at a hundred
thousand so that's where the line is
drawn but from this diagram we can see
how our data is distributed and where
the extreme values are one other
visualization that's becoming more
recognized that we won't cover in detail
but we should be aware of is the violin
plot as we can see it has similar
components as the box and whisker plot
but it adds in a component that shows
the volume of the distribution of the
data indicated by the way
of the blue area I like to think of it
as combining the aspects of a histogram
with the box and whisker plot so as to
provide a more complete view of the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
