programming assignment rather than
printing out the particles themselves I
want you to print out the overall
quality of the solution and to do this
I've programmed for you an eval code
which takes in as a robot position and a
particle set and it computes the average
error of each particle relative to the
robot pose in X&amp;amp;Y not in the orientation
and the way it does it it basically
compares the X of the particle with the
XS robot computes the Euclidian distance
of these differences and averages all of
those so it sums them all up and it
averages them through the number of
particles over here which is a per cap
Sen now there's some funny stuff over
here the reason is the world is so click
and it might be the devil is at zero
point zero or at 99.9 these are about
the same values but according to this
calculation over here they'd be
different
so by this normalization over here I
make sure that the suit olicity of the
world doesn't really affect negatively
the x-men error if I'm close to the
boundary me my parses I'm adding word
size / - then computer model operation
and then subtract the same thing over
here I can't even see it it's just too
long line be it as it is I want you to
take the function eval and produce a
sequence of performance evaluations and
when you hit the Run button I want you
to produce something like the stuff over
here 4.9 3.6 2.9 2.8 3.1 this is the
residual error remember it's a world of
size 100 by 100 so this is actually a
relatively small error compared to the
world sighs can you code it so I get for
each iteration the error number produced
by this routine over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
