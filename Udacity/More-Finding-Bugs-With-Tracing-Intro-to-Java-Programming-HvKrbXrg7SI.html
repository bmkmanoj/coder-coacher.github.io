use object tracing to find a bug in a
method implementation and I'd like to
show you another kind of bug that's
fairly common so over here I have my
drive method
I Drive a given distance I update the
miles driven I compute the gas consumed
I update the gas and tank and when a
compiled it I get an error message which
says cannot find symbol variable gas
consumed
that's complaining over here now it's a
common error to now say oh it can't find
it so let me just make another instance
variable so on the surface it doesn't
seem like an error because the class
will compile and actually the code will
kind of work but it's really inelegant
let's use the tracing technique to find
out why note that this class now has
four instance variables here they are on
an index card and now let's quickly run
through the same scenario that we had
previously the car gets constructed we
add 30 gallons we drive 10 miles that
consumes a gallon we then drive 20 miles
for a total of 30 that consumes 2
gallons were left with 27 gallons so
what's wrong have a look at this
variable the stuff that it remembers is
short term information the amount of gas
consumed the last time we drove that's
just like remembering what Pete say you
had for lunch you don't really need to
remember this long term that's
absolutely no need to remember these
values after a call to drive they should
be short term memory that should be a
local variable okay let's make it so
over here let's not make gas consumed
into an instance variable over here we
turn it into a local variable simply by
adding the type remember the difference
between an assignment and a variable
declaration is nothing but the type now
the code will compile and when we review
the instance variables up here we will
find that there are no unnecessary ones
your car doesn't need to remember the
miles driven at the gas level across
multiple method calls and of course it
needs to know the mileage so that it can
compute the gas consumption so you've
just seen how the technique of object
tracing gives us an insight into
what an object does and it lets us find
some errors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
