have been tricky here you want to make
sure that it's n times 6-3 n this is one
factor in these denominators and in is a
completely different factor so we want
to multiply those two together to get
our LCD for the first term will have 5
times 6 minus 3n and for the second term
we'll have plus 4 times N or positive
for in the right side of our equation is
simply to N squared since these factors
reduce to 1 if we distribute positive 5
and combine our like terms will get
30-11 n equals to n squared now that
this part we have a quadratic equation
since we have a 2n squared we want to
set this equation equal to zero by
moving our rearranging these two terms
if we move these terms to the right side
of the equation will get 0 is equal to
2n squared plus 11-30 this is something
that we can factor and solve so here's
our equation and to factor it we want to
find the factors of negative 60 that's
sum to positive 11 when we use factoring
by grouping we'll get 2n plus 15 as one
factor and n minus 2 as another finally
we set each factor equal to zero and
then solve the two remaining equations n
could equal negative 15 halves or n
could equal positive 2 and here's where
we want to be careful we need to check
for the excluded values for the original
equation we know n cannot equal 0 since
this denominator would equal 0 and the
fraction would be undefined we also know
that n cannot equal to if n was equal to
both of these denominators would be 0
and these two fractions would be
undefined this means that this solution
is not valid we can only take this as
our actual solution so here's our
solution set negative 15 apps fantastic
algebraic thinking for getting that one
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
