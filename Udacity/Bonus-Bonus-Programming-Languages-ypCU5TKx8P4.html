all the sub lists in one big list
instead of printing them out well let's
try something like this instead of
printing out what we've selected so far
I will return it and then down here when
I make my two recursive calls I'll make
a list of the first one and add it to
the list of the second one and see how
that works and to make it a little
easier to evaluate the answer will go
back down to just two people so we know
there should be four options when we
stare at it a bit this looks pretty good
here's the answer with both of them
here's one here's the other and here's
no one but let's check and make sure
that it's actually coming out equally if
it's coming out equally I should be able
to get these four elements out of the
list independently the four answers
uh-oh that didn't work we can see that
we haven't been building this up into a
sort of an evenly balanced list there
are too many opening square brackets
here not enough in other places I could
try returning this is a singleton list
but it doesn't make us any happier ah
but here if I return the base case is a
singleton list and then concatenate
these two lists together I get the four
separate parts of the answers i was
expecting just to review that i'm going
to go back to the wrong world here's the
wrong world we're in the leaf case i
just returned the list of people
selected so far and then in the
recursive case I make a list of that and
concatenate it with the list of the
other that actually doesn't work out
what I really want instead is to return
a singleton list at every leaf and then
just gather them up they may seem very
similar but if the depth of the tree is
more than one if this is a long tree
that might have eight things at the
bottom the wrong way ends up adding too
many sort of nested levels of listing
this way adds exactly the right amount
so here let's just print out our answer
now we can see that it's a list of four
elements both of them just one just the
other none of them and if i add in susan
b anthony a list of eight elements
nicely done you followed along gotten
some practice with a brute-force
procedure to enumerate all the sublist
Civil List and a little more experience
with debugging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
