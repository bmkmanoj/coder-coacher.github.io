it's often pretty complex you might
imagine a story with lots of interesting
graphics and enemies but the core of the
game is usually very simple and this
core is the first thing you want to test
out before you distribute your game to a
wider audience you want to make sure
your game foundation is strong by
testing it out with a small group of
players to test your game core you need
to create a Minimum Viable Product which
is the simplest most focused version of
your game minimum means it contains the
minimum amount of features that
encapsulate the game no extra levels or
graphics let's look at some examples of
a Minimum Viable Product consider the
game mega trade which is a platformer
game where you jump through stages
getting upgrades and shooting robot
enemies to advanced levels you can even
generate your own playable levels this
game has a lot of fun features but what
do we need in the Minimum Viable Product
level creation no enemies no weapon
upgrades or even weapons at all no these
are all extra features that can be added
later in the game to test the foundation
of the game we need to remove all the
enemies items and extra levels all the
things that are nice to have but not
necessary to have and what we're left
with is a single jumping platform game
to make a mega trade minimum viable
product
I would include just a single level
where I can move and jump and fall into
pits I might also include an easy
restart for the game this defines the
basic structure of my game these are the
minimum needed features and they're the
most important to perfect we want to
test this version out and make sure that
the game movement is as smooth and
high-quality as possible then we can add
enemies and upgrades later on so when
you're thinking about what to include in
your Minimum Viable Product think about
what features are needed for your game
to be entertaining and what can be added
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
