they're extra complicated suppose you
give me your finite state machine a here
I've drawn all these dots to mean it
could be bigger in the middle I don't
get to know what it is this is going to
have to work for any finite state
machine but I do know that it has a
start state and an end-state a final
state so here's what I'm going to do I'm
going to draw another copy of a on my
paper and then I'm going to go back to
the first one and where it was a final
state I'm going to make it not a final
state so i changed this part then I'm
going to add an epsilon transition here
and I'm going to erase this other start
state arrow now I have a new finite
state machine that except strings of the
following form there has to be some part
x here that would have been accepted by
a and then there's some possibly
different part why here that would be
accepted by a again so in general I
except X epsilon Y or just X Y so in
fact I can always do this if you give me
any finite state machine I can always
make a twice as big finite state machine
that accepts one string from you
followed by one independent separate
string from you however for this one
it's going to be a little more
complicated turns out that the answer is
only sometimes let me give you an
example for yes and an example for no
let's say the finite state machine you
give me for Big B just has one string in
it lowercase B I'll do the same trickery
as before and now I have a new finite
state machine that accepts BB since
there's only one string in the language
I've now doubled it this works fine so I
can do it at least once but now here
comes the evil part so this upper
example this blue example of be totally
worked but now i'm going to give you an
example for be that does not here b is a
star X so this finite state machine
accepts the regular expression a star X
any number of A's possibly zero but then
you need an X now note the difference
between this sentence and its earlier
copy this requires exactly the same
string doubled so let's imagine that I
do complete this finite state machine
construction the same sort of thing I've
done before now i'm going to write out
some of the strings
would be in a star X twice well I could
have no A's so then I have no ace
followed by an X or I could have won a
that's looking ok so far or i could have
2 a's or i could have 3 a's this pattern
should be looking ominous or in general
if i were able to double this machine so
that it accepted the same string both
times rather than a new string each time
i would be recognizing a to the NX a to
the NX and for the same reason that a to
the n B to the N can't be recognized
it's not regular neither can this so
here we have one positive example in one
negative example so it only holds
sometimes this was super tricky do not
feel bad if you didn't see this the
first time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
