myself a Bay Area native I grew up in
fremont and i'm a genetic counselor and
technically I guess my title is
perinatal genetic counselor so I focus
on patients who are pregnant or thinking
about pregnancy so walk us through what
is it like I mean who what kind of
patient comes to you and how does the
workflow process work when they seek out
a genetic counselor ok so the workflow
for a perinatal genetic counselor and
perinatal is actually kind of a new
phrase we created at where I work
traditionally the word has been prenatal
so before birth and then there's
postnatal and now that we're doing so
much intervention before birth that
affects after birth we use a combination
of perinatal so most of the patients
that I see are pregnant actively
pregnant and thinking about doing some
testing to check for either genetic
conditions or birth defects sometimes we
see patients before they get pregnant
but they know they want to have children
and know that there might be at risk for
a certain condition so our appointments
are fairly they're like office
consultations we do a little prep work
we might contact them on the phone and
get a little family history or medical
history and then our meeting with them
is probably about 40 minutes 40 to 60
minutes long and then afterwards if
we've ordered testing or there's other
appointments to make will follow up and
help patients with that now really
curious about the the testing so do
patients come to you and say I want to
know what's in my genes and what I pass
on and you guys do a test for them yeah
so I think our patients are a little
biased I mean I'm sure there it seems
like they're they're certainly patients
out there who would say are people out
there who would say they don't want to
their know their genetic status and
those patients we never end up seeing
because they would just decline an
appointment with us so those that we do
see definitely are interested in some
kind of genetic information whether it's
for themselves or primarily for their
pregnancy or for their future child so
yeah so sometimes there's something
specific in the family that we're
looking for we've had some patients to
say test me for everything I want to
know everything and we have to explain
the science and technology's not quite
there yet and so we're trying to
pinpoint what can we are
for you accurate testing specific
testing something that would be helpful
to so a lot of what I do is I think of
it as a consultation but also just
providing information I see us as a link
between physicians and patients that
traditionally doctors order tests that
are fairly straightforward like a blood
count or a blood type or something like
that and they can easily tell a patient
what that means in a sentence with this
genetic testing it's much more
complicated than that it's not always a
straightforward yes or no and doctors
don't have time to spend with patients
explaining that and so I see us as a
bridge between that being able to help
patients decipher and interpret this
information and then also helping them
make decisions based on those results
because a lot of decisions to be made
especially in pregnancy are not always
medical decisions their personal
decisions about what patients want to do
about information about their future
offspring so so prenatal specifically is
an interesting ethical realm because
we're also dealing with pregnancy and
and termination what's the most
difficult aspect of that if I can ask is
it is it patients actually you know
deciding about you know continuing the
pregnancy versus not are there
significant traits that they have to
deal with I just looking for some kind
of idea when it when it does get gray as
far as like the difficult part of the
job yeah so ya know you bring up a good
point I actually hadn't thought about
that before one of the difficulties in
the job in what I do with pregnancy is
we're not always we're certainly talking
about genetic testing sometimes we're
dealing with other kinds of tests and
pregnancy like ultrasounds so video
picture of the baby where you see a
physical problem that might be something
that suggested genetic condition like
Down syndrome or something else and
seeing the physical problem doesn't
guarantee what the outcome is going to
be and so that is one difficulty in
prenatal that you don't have a live
person in front of you to say oh this
person's actually fine maybe they have
an extra finger or toe but they're
otherwise healthy in a pregnancy you
don't you don't have that baby in front
of you and you can't check if there's
other things going on so I think that
definitely is one difficult aspect of
what I do specifically
and I would just say in general just
dealing with pregnant patients as tough
pregnancy is a time-limited event so I
feel like of all the subspecialties in
genetic counseling prenatal is usually
the one the most time sensitive were
under deadlines for scheduling
appointments seeing patients test
results and just the anxiety of the
patients themselves they also have
hormone issues to deal with it's a very
emotional time so it can be quite
challenging but it also can be quite
satisfying so I'm also curious what is
is there a common trait or condition
that you counsel for the most like what
is what are the things that you either
end up counseling for or do people come
to you and ask them us what are they
were most interested in so for my
specific specialty in pre nail by far I
think nationwide the most common
condition that we're talking about is
down syndrome but I was thinking about
how I explain why I think it's a
combination of things because the
condition is genetic but it's not
inherited so it would randomly appear
and there we be no other way to tell
about it other than to check for it in
that pregnancy and is there's a known
association with the age of the mom as
women get older there's a higher chance
of Down syndrome the insurance is
actually will cover testing for Down
syndrome so that's kind of a supportive
step that that aids us in seeing
patients it's common common condition I
think about one at eight hundred a
thousand births for down syndrome occur
and it can be a long-term disability
children with Down syndrome grow up into
adults they have intellectual disability
they can have health issues and so it
seems like there's enough interest in
that that we have this testing so for my
specialty it's fairly easy we talk
primarily about that and some related
conditions whereas in other specialties
like Pediatrics where I used to work it
could be a range of things a variety of
things depending on what a child comes
in to for us to see whether it's a
learning problem would think about would
make us think about certain conditions
versus if it was a physical birth defect
like a heart defect or a cleft lip that
would shift our gear to something else
what's the most difficult trait you've
had to
so is it down syndrome or is there
another more difficult situation or
trade that you've had to let's say
council the family on or a couple I mean
one of my most memorable patient cases
had to not to do with a prenatal case
but a pediatric case where we were
seeing a child and part of the list of
conditions we were thinking about was
teh secks disease so that one is also a
known single gene recessive condition
that is common in people of Jewish
background so when we were thinking
about that disease that usually means
that the child is coming in with delays
and maybe normal development than loss
of delays so it's not like it was it's a
surprise to the family we we would talk
to them about this is a possibility
we're going to be ordering tests for
this condition but it's always hard to
have to call or contact a family and
tell them this is this this is a
condition so I think any kind of test
result that confirms a condition that it
has high risk for complications or early
death that's never easy to convey so the
families really have all this
information like are you able to build
like these massive pedigree sir do you
end up building these sort of more like
just maybe two or three generation so
families vary in how much information
they can give us for pedigrees I see a
lot of patients also I should mention
that come from other countries
especially Asia we're not as not much is
known about family members people don't
talk about conditions in the family so
the pet and and people don't have that
many children so the pedigrees can be
very sparse so just like a circle and a
square and circle to square in that says
and then all the way to families who
have their whole genealogy trees mapped
out with the aid of all these online
tools so they come in with their
pedigrees already drawn so it's really a
fun part of our job job but it's also
efficient to draw this out instead of
trying to describe all these people I
have a really interesting question to
ask for all of our students you might be
struggling with pedigrees out there how
do you as an
genetic counselor say you're studying at
ray how do you distinguish when you're
looking at traits a a recessive or
dominant trait and put it in context of
what you think's going on so the so
trying to figure out a trait whether its
dominant recessive review an x-linked
those are the top three modes of
inheritance that we're looking at we
actually have a term called pedigree
analysis and you know it's it's a
subjective thing but it really is
looking at the pedigree and going
through kind of all the rules of what
dominant inheritance looks like what
recessive inheritance looks like so if
you see a trait that happens in a
grandparent a parent and a child then
that's much more likely to be a dominant
trait if you see a condition where
multiple brothers and sisters are and by
chance maybe their parents are related
to each other and no one else in the
family has a trait then that's more
likely or suggestive of something
recessive and then if you see only boys
affected through moms that could be more
x-linked so the pedigree really does
help us try to figure out modes of
inheritance thank you so much thank you
very much for the opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
