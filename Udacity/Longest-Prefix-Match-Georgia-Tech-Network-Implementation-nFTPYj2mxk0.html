prefix match so each packet has a
destination IP address which determines
where the packets should be forwarded
next and a router basically looks up a
table entry that matches that address so
for example a forwarding table might
have a number of prefixes in it and many
of these prefixes might be overlapping
but when we see an IP address it may
match on one or more prefixes in this
table we simply match that IP address to
the entry in the forwarding table with
the longest matching prefix so the
benefits of cider and longest matching
prefix are efficiency since prefix
blocks can be allocated on a much finer
granularity than with classful inter
domain routing and the opportunity for
aggregation if two down stream networks
with more specific or longer prefixes
should be treated in the same way by an
upstream Network who might simply
aggregate two contiguous shorter
prefixes into one forwarding table entry
with a shorter prefix for example a
benefit for aggregation might exist if
two down stream networks a and B each
had 16 address space allocated to them
but upstream all the traffic always came
through the same upstream network see if
the rest of the Internet only reached a
and B via C then the rest of the
Internet need only know about C's
address space which might be 12/8 this
might allow the upstream network to
simply aggregate or not announce these
more specific prefixes since they're
already covered by the less specific
upstream prefix now cider had a
significant effect on slowing the growth
of the internet routing tables from 1994
to 1998
so from 1994 to 1998 we see roughly
linear growth in the number of prefixes
in the internet routing table around
2000 fast growth in routing tables
resumed you can see that growth here
once again started to pick up a
significant contributor to this growth
was a practice called multihoming
multihoming can actually make it
difficult for upstream providers
you aggregate IP prefixes together often
requiring an upstream provider to store
multiple IP prefixes for a single
autonomous system sometimes those IP
prefixes are contiguous and sometimes
they aren't let's take a quick look at
how multihoming can stymie aggregation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
