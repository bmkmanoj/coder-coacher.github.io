the requirements that we have identified
for it and one of them is this
requirement that the trusted part be
isolated and not be tampered with by the
untrusted application or user code for
us to be able to do that we're going to
see that we're going to need help from
the hardware okay so remember operating
system layered on top of the hardware
that we have but the hardware has to
implement certain functionality and that
has to do with protecting memory where
the trusted system is going to reside
and so the hardware is going to help us
protect the trusted part of the system
from untrusted applications and that is
actually going to be the reason we're
going to be able to isolate it or make
it a tamper-proof when you talk about
isolating then we also have to talk
about well something has to be different
when you're executing user or
application code versus when you
actually go into the operating system or
when you executing the trusted software
that we that makes up the operating
system well the hardware actually is
going to do something else for us the
process or that is executing actually is
going to execute in different modes the
execution modes say either I am
executing user code that is not trusted
or I'm executing system code so the
processor is actually aware of what kind
of code it is executing so one obvious
thing we can do when it's executing user
code for example the process I'm in user
mode I shouldn't be touching anything
that belongs to the operating system or
the trusted base that we have the
trusted computing base that we have when
I'm executing in the system mode then
I'm allowed to access the code and the
data that makes up the trusted system so
the hardware is sort of aware of you
know what is going on at a given time in
particular what execution mode is it
running n the execution mode these thing
goes by a different name it's called
so-called execution rings so ring is
sort of think about you know a privilege
level in some sense when you are in the
system mode you have the highest per
religious and there could be many of
these in fact several processor
architectures support more than 2 i'm
just talking with user and system but
you know the innermost ring with the
trusted computing base resides the most
privileged as you move out of that you
for example could move to the user ring
and then your privileges are reduced
because you can't access what can be
accessed by being in the trusted
computing base so this execution modes
that we're talking about whether you're
in system mode or user mode you can also
say you're in the ring that you know you
reside in when you are in the system
mode versus the user ring or mode so it
goes by different names either execution
modes system supervisor variety of these
names but the idea here is that the
processor for the hardware knows that
it's you know execution state is such
the state indicates the mode that we're
talking about so it's either running
with higher level of privileges it can
do certain things that it's only allowed
to do when it's running the trusted code
or it's in in the non trusted it's
executing the non trusted or untrusted
code when it's in user mode so again
memory protection but then this process
or being aware of what its mode
execution mode is that's something else
we're going to need to meet the trusted
computing based requirements that we had
identified for ourselves so if you are
in different modes we said you should be
able to do more things when you are in
the system or more privileged mode
compared to when you are in user or less
privileged mode well certain hardware
instructions they call puh-leeze
instructions they can only be executed
when the processor is in the innermost
ring or the most foolish ring or is in
the system mode or ring 0 it's it's
called 0 is the most foolish and you go
out with it 0 1 2 3 become less
privileged so privileged instructions
are special instructions that you cannot
execute when you are in the user mode a
lot of times these instructions sort of
help you figure out what parts of memory
you can access for example or these are
hardware devices that we
we need to control these kind of
instructions direct access to the
hardware we said is not available to
user code similarly you know what parts
the memory you can access cannot be
manipulated at user level if it could be
then you can go access somebody else's
memory so those kind of actions require
use of instructions that can only be
executed in the system mode and these
instructions are called privileged
instructions or instructions that can be
executed in a higher privilege level
ring or mode that you are in so one of
the ways in which we're going to be able
to meet the requirements that we
identified for a trusted computing base
is by making use of a number of
different things the hardware does for
us it does memory protection it gives us
this execution modes we're talking about
it also has these special instructions
that cannot be executed when we are not
in the right mode so with this support
from the hardware will see we will be
able to do isolation or the tamper
resistance that is one of the
requirements for a trusted computing
base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
