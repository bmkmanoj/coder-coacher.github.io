hours let's jump right in
all right so many students myself
included had some questions about the
resampling wheel and specifically when
you draw a random number between zero
and twice w max what did that number
twice w max come from I I have the same
question I made it up
I want to make sure that these that we
can jump over an entire particles I'm
going to be large enough probably make
me large then you have to search a lot
so I figured if it's 2 n that's gonna be
fine and is this this bias the sample in
any way choosing this this number I
actually don't know so I I think there
are certainly correlation between
adjacent particles in the selection of
particles so they're not independently
drawn I just don't know what the effect
on the particle filter would be okay and
I wish I did
the next question to questions is should
saying comes from George Bryn Darrow
and he wants to know if there are any
rules of thumb that we should keep in
mind when we're choosing what filter to
use for a given situation so when do we
use the particle filter when do we use
Kalman filter absolutely yes so the
particle filter is the easiest to
implement but the complexity scales
exponentially with the number of
dimensions and that's usually a problem
because if you have a high dimensional
space you just can't apply it the common
filter is the only filter that doesn't
scale exponentially so it's very nice so
if you have like a 15 dimensional space
you will usually use a particle filter
but the problem of the camera is is
unimodal so it can't be have multiple
hypotheses there's extensions of the
common fit so do this called mixture of
carbon filter multi it was this common
filter they can do this the dress amis
problems
the grid kind of histogram filter is
applicable in similar situations similar
to the particle filters we have the
global uncertainty and it's more
systematic so in the particle filter if
you lose track of the correct hypothesis
you might never regain it in a
grid-based further you have a chance of
regaining it grits are easily supported
in many programming frameworks so some
of the better ones to use but they also
have a generic limitation and the
accuracy which is related with the
Brazil
resolution of the grid my recommendation
is if you have a multi mode of
distribution use particle filters if you
can and if it's really a continuous
space with a unimodal distribution who's
coming with us okay it's a great segue
into AB Sherwin's question which is
about switching between filters on
slides so for example you know we have
our particle filter converges to a
univille in a modal distribution and
then can we switch to the common filter
it isn't done much the people switch and
the reason is when you switch between
filters you end up getting moments of
increased uncertainty you can see this
when you when you buy commercial GPS
receivers they tend to run much the
commentator's turns out depending on
whether it's 2d or 3d navigation when
they switch the behavior becomes a
little bit iffy and often it's bad for
robots because in the jump a little bit
because it's where this is this thing
that this is the other thing they're not
quite consistent yeah it's ways to
combine multiple filter types and the
most common one is Quadra or black
polarized filter Raoh black utilized
after our black ball but they found this
that in a particle domain sometimes if
you nail certain dimensions of the
particles everything else conditional on
the particle becomes Gaussian or
unimodal and and then you can exploit
the efficiency of a common filter that
is now attached to individual particles
I'm never going any depth here but
there's an entire field of raw black
polarized filters that samplers can
estimate in the spaces of hundreds of
dimensions great thank you and actually
pretty physics George Brin Dara's next
question so I was on drew Noakes wanted
to know about what happens to a particle
filter when the motion model moves a
particle into an invalid place so for an
example in that corridor demonstration
you gave what if a part of it gets moved
into a wall
well thanks drew a great question the
obvious answer is he cleared a particle
and the way to think about this is in
the measurement model you could have
this kind of implicit sensor that says
I'm just sitting inside a ball and the
truth is what would never sits inside
the wall so listen they would always say
with absolute certainty
I'm not sitting in the middle of wall so
this kind of hypothetical sense I would
justify that the weight of their
particle
in the middle of the wall would get
weighed zero so you just kid it okay
and a couple more questions from Drew
what about dynamically adjusting that
are big in our number of particles based
when we want to trade off between
computational cost versus the accuracy
of our filter so dynamically setting the
number of patents has been done quite a
bit and it's a good idea in a certain
circumstances obviously the fewer
particles you have the faster you can
compute if you're tracking really well
and all the particles are sitting up on
location there isn't really need to have
as many around as many globally and
certainly the way to set the number of
particles is often done by looking at
the total non-normalized importance
weights so while your importance weights
are really large and you're probably
doing a great job tracking you don't
need that many particles whereas if
you're important there's all very small
then chances are you're doing a really
lousy job tracking many more particles
that isn't perfect so an unlikely
measurement can cause waste to be small
but a good heuristic would be to say
this particle sample until our
non-normalized importance weighs reach a
certain threshold and then there's stop
sampling now truth-telling many of the
systems we dealing with our real-time
systems and you can't really afford
using many particles sometimes a few
other times because there's a fixed
amount of time between which one do you
estimates and then the expo is more
tricky but in principle using few
particles when you track well is a very
viable solution okay Thank You Chuck I
also had a question he wants to know
distinguish between moving landmarks and
nonliving landmarks the maps that we
dealt with in class were all stack and
the landmarks were fixed what happens
how does the Google car distinguish
between these moving vehicles moving
people and these static landmarks yes
that's a wonderful question um first of
all the Google car assumes that the
ground map like the surface map of the
street is basically fixed so if Marcus
would move along a little bit the Nick I
would probably get confused little
secret here so please don't repaint your
lane rather the movie that comes by
there's treated differently from stuff
that sticks out of the ground and even
then is used as landmark what we do is
we have a threshold probably
successional that says what's the chance
of this thing being mobile or not and we
do this by establishing correspondence
which means we take measure
the time step earlier in measurements
time Selita see which is the most likely
correspondence Bautista measurements and
then see if there's a motion vector in
between sometimes we can explain the way
but it's noise but for cars and people
and so on there's very often a very
clear and strong motion in which case we
assume this thing is moving on tracking
it also turns out that the way we build
our prior maps is sometimes which I find
multiple times we do different saying
and then we have mostly captions are
static things in our Maps we happen to
know that in the middle of a street they
tend to be no static things it tends to
be moving things so you can bias the
estimate towards saying well on the
middle street whatever you see is likely
not static and tossing this all together
gives us a fairly good tracker okay but
I want to make a comment idea that many
people are really positively received
the homework assignment on particle
filters which is great it took me a
while to make it there's also on the
discussion forum there's a posting of a
graphical version of it and I downloaded
it looks really great
could get the Cosette Keys to work on my
computer but it's really great places to
visualize and I think particle filters
are really hard to understand without
visualization so I'm really sorry that
our current program environment doesn't
provide realization I hope in the next
round we will fix that and for usually
fixes so please play with it the other
thing I noticed in the discussion boards
no one does call for feedback and same
for the Facebook group there are people
who are tired of homework assignments
I'm not sure that's true universally so
you have an opinion why don't you just
post it I'd like to get a sense of it
I'm thinking of making an assignment
where we toss everything together and
really build like a mini version of an
actual car there's gonna be be involved
so let me know what do you feel like I
mean I this course right now I would I
guess is really Stanford caliber what
you guys are doing your girls are doing
is really at a quality that I would
expect my best and for students to do
the type things you implement so knees
are the same pace teach at Stanford and
possibly faster but if I go to a general
kind of build a robot example that I'm
gonna exceed beyond sever pace so it's
up to you let us know
all right keep us posted I'll be reading
the forum's I'm sure Sebastian will too
thank you very much and see you next
week all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
