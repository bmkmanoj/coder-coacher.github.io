unrealistic let's have a look at this
diagram so now the horizontal axis is
not that time it's the amount of fish
and the vertical axis is the growth rate
with exponential growth the growth rate
does not depend on the amount of fish
even if the oceans were full of fish we
would still have the same growth rate
which cannot be true there should be
some sort of carrying capacity at which
the growth rate becomes zero the easiest
way to include this effect is to use a
growth rate that depends on the amount
of fish in a linear fashion this is
called logistic growth if the amount of
fish is very small we start with a high
growth rate and s the amount of fish
increases the growth rate drops and if
the amount of fish reaches the carrying
capacity of the environment there won't
be any growth anymore how do we turn
this effect plus constant harvesting
into an equation here are three options
for you to choose from should the rate
of change of the amount of fish be 0
point 5 over 1 year times the amount
minus ten to the six stones minus 10 to
the 5 tons per year or should it be 0
point 5 per here x 1 minus the amount of
a temper the six tons times the amount
minus 10 to the 5 tons per year or
should it be 0 point 5 per here times
the amount minus ten to the six stones
times the amount minus 10 to the 5 tons
per year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
