ends in the last quiz took me a really
long time so I can only imagine how
tortures that would have been if I had
had to multiply to end by a number
bigger than 11 fortunately there's a
much easier way to simplify terms and
then adding them together like we did
then to talk about how this works let's
start by considering a term let's say 5x
times 7y times 2z now remember a term is
a bunch of variables or numbers or both
that are multiplied together and before
we start playing around with this term
I'd like to add one more word to our
vocabulary factor now factors are things
that we multiply together just like
terms are things that we add together so
this term 5x times 7y times 2z is made
up of a bunch of factors that are all
multiplied together
another way to think of a factor is it's
something that a term is divisible by
now we can't forget that in this term
there are invisible multiplication signs
between the 5 and the X the 7 and the Y
and the 2 and the Z so another way to
think about this term is that it's 5
times X times 7 times y times 2 times Z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
