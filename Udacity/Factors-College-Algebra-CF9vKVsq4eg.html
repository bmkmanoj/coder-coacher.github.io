ends in the last quiz took me a really
long time so I can only imagine how
tortures that would have been if I'd had
to multiply to end by a number bigger
than 11 fortunately there's a much
easier way to simplify terms then adding
them together like we did then to talk
about how this works let's start by
considering a term let's say 5 x x 7 y x
2 z now remember a term is a bunch of
variables or numbers or both that are
multiplied together and before we start
playing around with this term I'd like
to add one more word our vocabulary
factor now factors are things that we
multiply together just like terms are
things that we add together so this term
5x times 7 y times 2 z is made up of a
bunch of factors that are all multiplied
together another way to think of a
factor is it something that a term is
divisible by now we can't forget that in
this term there are invisible
multiplication signs between the five
and the x 7 and the y and the 2 and the
Z so another way to think about this
term is that it's 5 times X times 7
times y times 2 times Z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
