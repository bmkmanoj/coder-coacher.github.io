be breaking some code today so what you
need to do for this homework is break a
few incorrect implementations of the
fixed size queue we've been working with
earlier in the unit so let's go ahead
and take a look at what the queue is
supposed to do first
so the queue class is just a fixed size
queue of integers and the constructor
down here is supposed to take a single
integer parameter greater than zero that
is the maximum number a number of
elements that the queue can hold at a
time and there are four methods that
we're going to need to concern ourselves
with and these method calls are all
you're going to have access to during
this the empty call should return true
if and only if the queue currently holds
no elements and false otherwise the full
method should do the exact opposite it
should return true if and only if the
queue cannot hold any more elements it's
completely full and false otherwise so
you would call them like this or like
this for the empty and full methods
respectively the n queue is the only one
that takes a parameter it takes an
integer to put into the queue it returns
true if it successfully does so and it
returns false otherwise which would only
happen or should only happen if the
queue is full and the DQ method does not
take any parameters and removes an
integer from the queue and returns it if
it doesn't if it fails to return
anything which should only happen if the
queue is empty then it returns none so
as an example you have this code where
we first create a queue of size 1 then
we check if it's empty which it should
be immediately since we haven't done
anything with it so is empty should be
true then we try to include a number 10
which also should succeed since it
should be able to hold one more element
so succeeded should be true then we
check of its fall which should also be
true because
we've Justin cued one element we can
only hold one element so foolish is full
should be true then we'd EQ that element
and should return ten into value so
value should be ten from here to give
you an idea of what we should expect
from the queue implementation now the
five cues that you're going to test for
are going to have bugs here and there in
them so they're not going to behave
exactly like this
so I've very much recommended reading
over this specification carefully before
you start testing now to test the five
cues you're going to do exactly what you
do here you would instantiate a queue
and call these four methods in some
fashion and then using assert statements
you would try to break this code and
throw in a assertion error on the back
end we'll have a test harness that runs
your code against all of the buggy queue
implementations and will return the
incorrect output if you managed to find
it and when you run submit on your code
it will tell you how many of the buggy
queue limitations you have managed to
successfully catch as an example of what
your test code should do if we run my
implementation against the buggy code
then we see that we get an assertion
error here so your code should run
assertion errors for all of the buggy
code we'll have a test harness that will
run your code against all five of the
incorrect implementations and when you
submit your code will tell you how many
of the implementations you've managed to
successfully catch and your goal is to
catch all five it took me I think 22
lines to catch all the bugs so let's see
if you can beat me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
