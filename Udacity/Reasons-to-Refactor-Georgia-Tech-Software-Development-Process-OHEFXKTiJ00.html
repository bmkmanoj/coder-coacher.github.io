are the goals of refactoring but what
are the reasons why we need to refactor
in the first place the first reason is
that requirements change and when
requirements change we often need to
change our design accordingly
in other cases even if requirements
don't change we might need to improve
our design and this happens for many
reasons for example we need to add a new
feature we want to make the code more
maintainable and also in general
programmers don't come up with the best
design the first time so they might need
to adapt it after the fact and the final
reason I wanna mention is sloppiness in
to some extent laziness of programmers
and a typical example of this is
something that we all have done which is
copy and paste programming so instead of
rewriting a new piece of code because we
know that there is some code in some
other parts of the program that does a
similar thing we'll just copy the code
over and before we know we end up with
tons of copies of the same functionality
and when that happens a good way of
consolidating that code and extracting
that functionality is to use refactoring
for example by creating a method or a
class that provides the functionality
and we'll see specific examples of that
a question I would like to ask at this
point of the class is whether you have
used refactoring before so I want you to
take a second and think about it and no
matter what your history is if you ever
caught it I bet you any money that the
answer is yes you have done refactoring
what do I mean I'm gonna give you an
example I'm sure you rename the class or
a method or change the name of some
variables in the code before that the
refactoring even something as simple as
renaming a class is a refactoring
because for example it might help you
making your code more understandable and
of course are admitted in this case this
is a trivial refactoring and there are
much more interesting ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
