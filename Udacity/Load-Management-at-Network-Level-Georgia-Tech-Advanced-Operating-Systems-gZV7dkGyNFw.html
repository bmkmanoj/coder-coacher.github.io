network level that is at the network
layer level of the seven-layer OSI
reference model in this case the load
manager is simply an old Robin domain
name server what it does is when clients
request comes in they all have the same
domain name in order to come to this
particular service if you say gmail com
then depending on how the server is
architected the gmail requests coming
from particular client may go to a
particular site and when it goes to that
site the domain name server which is
acting as a load manager what it is
going to do is it is going to direct the
incoming client requests to one of the
servers so it is giving different IP
addresses even though the domain name a
client is coming in is exactly the same
the round robin DNS server assigns
different IP addresses corresponding to
different servers to the incoming client
requests and that way these clients are
being redirected to different servers
and because the load manager is doing it
at the level of individual server
addresses you get very good load balance
and the inherent assumption in this
model is that all the servers are
identical so an incoming request can be
sent to any one of these servers and
perhaps the model is also that the data
is fully replicated so that if an
incoming client request goes to this
server it has access to all the data if
it goes to this server it has access to
all the data to satisfy the incoming
client requests so the Pro is good load
balance because the round robin DNS
scheduler can choose the least loaded
server to redirect an incoming client to
that particular server but the con is it
cannot hide down server nodes because it
is assigning IP addresses of the server
to the incoming requests the load
manager is not able to hide down server
nodes from the external world so now we
move the load manager up in the OSI
reference model up to the transport
level or even higher the load manager
be lay of four switches that has
transport level switches or even higher
level switches and in fact the lay of
four switches may be architected as
switch pairs so that there is hot
failover from one failed switch to
another failed switch at the load
balancer level when you do this
architecting the load balancer at the
transporter higher levels it gives you
the opportunity to dynamically isolate
down server nodes from the external
world and it is also possible with this
architecture of the load manager to have
service specific front end nodes for
example instead of dealing with
arbitrary client requests we're actually
dealing with requests based on that kind
of request coming in from a particular
client for instance this could be a
gmail client this could be a google
search client that this could be for a
photo server like picasa so those are
different functionalities that can be
implemented at the front end of this
load manager to look at the service the
particular program that is actually
triggering a client requests coming in
to this particular site and make
decisions as to who should serve that
particular request so in other words we
are building more intelligence in to the
load manager so that it can know the
semantics of the client-server
communication that is going to happen
based on the type of requests that is
coming in and it is also possible with
this structure of having the load
management at higher levels of the OSI
reference model to co-opt the client
devices in the load management for
example it's possible that the load
manager may even know the device
characteristics that the client is using
in order to come into the site for
example if it's a smartphone it might
take certain actions commensurate with
the device that is coming in in terms of
structuring the client server
interactions now the data itself may be
partitioned among all the servers for
example let's say that
you are doing a web search and it is a
web search that came in as a client
request and if it is redirected to a
particular server the server may not
have access to all the data that it
needs in order to do that Google search
that you came in with in that case the
server may communicate using the
backplane with other servers to get the
data that it needs to serve the queries
that is coming in so that there is
complete coverage of whatever the
intended query needs to get as a result
of course if the data is partitioned if
a server that is holding a portion of
the data is down then they'll be data
loss for the query so for your specific
search the server that is handling your
search may not be able to give you
complete result for the search because a
portion of the data is down due to the
partitioning of the data among the
different servers at the site now this
is where replicating the servers for
redundancy helps so even though you may
partition it you may replicate
partitions so that it is possible that
even if one server is down another
server that has a replica of the same
partition may be able to provide the
data that is needed in order to satisfy
a particular query</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
