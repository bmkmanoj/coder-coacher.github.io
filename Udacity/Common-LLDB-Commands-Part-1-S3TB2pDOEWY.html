for frame called variable but ll D B's
frame command can do much more than this
to demonstrate I'm back in the so many
bugs app and we're paused at the handle
single tap method that we've seen before
and this is in the break point bug view
controller from the console we can look
up information about ll DB commands
including frame by typing help so I'll
delete this and type help and I'll just
go ahead and scroll through all of this
so you can see the entire output we have
all of the commands and then there are
command abbreviations like the F R and
the V that we saw earlier that you can
see for the different commands and I'll
stop here for frame and here's the
information we have it says that frame
provides a set of commands for operating
on the current threads frames and by
frames it means stack frames so to get
more specific help information about
frame I can type the command frame
followed by help this delete button
clears out the console by the way so
that's what I clicked to do that will go
frame help and now we can see that frame
supports the following sub command so
there's the variable command that we
used earlier but it also supports info
and select and at the bottom it says for
help on any particular sub command we
can type help the command and then the
sub command so for example help frame
variable should give us the help
information about the variable sub
command well we've already seen the
variable sub command so I want to try
the two others so I've stopped the
application and I've kind of reset up
our debugging environment here I've set
a breakpoint at the add bug to view
method and there are no other
breakpoints in the particular app and
this is for the breakpoint bug view
controller and I've triggered this
breakpoint again by just tapping on the
screen so let's type frame info and we
can see that the output shows that the
current frame is frame 0 and this is for
the add bug to view method and this
mirrors what we have in the debug
navigator which is frame 0 and frame 0
is for the add bug to view method and to
switch the current stack frame we can
use the frame select sub command
followed by a frame number so I'll
select frame 1
and just like that Xcode jumps us to
stack frame one which is four handles
single tap here and you can see that
it's jumped us here in the code area as
well and this is pretty neat it's not
really that much different than what we
can achieve by just clicking around in
the debug navigator but you can do the
same thing here in the console by just
selecting different frames so now let's
really unleash the power of the command
line and do something that you can't
already do in the graphical interface
and we'll do this with the expression
command the expression command lets us
run Swift expressions in the current
debugging context so this is actually
really cool this means we can do things
like run methods or even changed the
values of variables while our program is
paused so I'll start typing the command
exp R which is an abbreviation for
expression followed by println and bugs
so this is just like the println
statement that we could put in our code
you can see that currently bugs is empty
so I'll go ahead and continue a couple
times so that bugs contains some things
and actually I'll turn this off this
break point off hit play so it runs all
the way through
we should have way too many bugs now
turn the breakpoint back on
I'll reach again let's run the same
expression we can see that our bugs
array is very full now that we have all
those extra bugs that have been created
so that first expression for just
printing that's pretty cool but let's
try something a little bit more fun we
can actually empty the bugs array so to
do this we'll use expression self dot
bugs dot remove all and this takes a
argument keep capacity and we'll specify
this is true and we'll enter and now
when I run this expression it appears
that it's completed but we don't see any
updates
visually if we go back to the simulator
there's nothing here and this makes
sense because we're paused at a
breakpoint after all so because we're
paused none of these changes have taken
effect but if the expression did run we
can quickly check while we're paused by
printing the bugs array again and we can
see that it's now empty and if we were
to step over we'll see that we drop
right into
if statement which also further
validates that the bugs count is now
zero or the bugs array is empty and that
is less than the maximum bug so now
we're dropping right back into that if
statement so we were able to change
things on the fly to all through the
execution of our program that's pretty
cool
I'll hit play and continue back and
there we go more bugs are created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
