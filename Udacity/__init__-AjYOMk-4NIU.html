can see my class movie and within it I
will begin to define the function in it
now there is something very curious
about this function already which is
that there are two underscores on both
sides of the word in it
these underscores that are way for
Python to tell us the programmers that
hey the name in it is essentially
reserved in Python and that this is a
special function or method what's
special about in it is that it
initializes or creates space in memory
to remember details like title storyline
etc for new movies that we are about to
create now in it takes a few pieces of
information or arguments the first of
which is always the Python keyword self
now what is this thing called self you
ask well you can think of self as itself
or the instance being created so when we
run this line of code in our other
Python file by the way just to remind
you here we are trying to clear a new
movie called Toy Story and when we run
this line of code we know that the init
function inside the class movie gets
called self in that case points to Toy
Story now here I have a confession to
make I remember when I was first
learning object oriented programming
years ago in college this concept of
self was really difficult for me to
understand if that is the case with you
don't worry about it too much for now
this will get really clear when we run
this entire piece of code in a few
seconds in any case let's add the
keyword self to our list of new words
okay I'm going to go back to the class
movie and continue to define the
function in it now we want in it to
initialize pieces of information like
title storyline and others that we want
to remember inside our class here's the
way to do that I will say self dot title
then self dot storyline the next one is
poster image URL and finally trailer
YouTube URL now we have to somehow
initialize these variables with
information in it is going to receive
and in particular it's going to receive
four pieces of information the first
which is a movie title next is the movie
storyline then the poster image of the
movie and finally the trailer on YouTube
so get this once I have received these
four pieces of information as arguments
to the init function I can initialize my
movie variables here's how to do that
self dot title is the movie title self
dot storyline is the movie storyline
next is the poster image and finally the
trailer on YouTube now here I have a
confession to make
which is that we've written a lot of
code that looks new and strange well the
one thing I can say is that we should
all just take a pause and a deep breath
together for now all I want you to do is
pause this video and write down this
code on your computer all of this code
will make sense as soon as we run this
program now there is one key point I
would like to highlight before I execute
this piece of code which is that if I go
to my other Python file which is
entertainment center PI and run this
piece of code it will throw an error the
error will happen because when we try to
create the movie Toy Story the init
function gets called which is now
looking for several arguments or pieces
of information although we are not
sending it any information whatsoever so
let me change that now I know that the
first argument for the init function is
self which is added by default in Python
so I will skip it the next one is movie
title which I know is Toy Story so I
will add that after that is the movie
storyline so I will type that in next a
story of a boy and his toys that come to
life the next one is the poster image so
I will add that I had previously gone on
to Wikipedia and found a link to toy
stories poster so I added that and
finally the YouTube trailer which I will
add also there it is now let me just
scroll back so we can see the beginning
of the code here I recognize that you
can see all of the code so what I've
done is taken an image of the code and
put it in the instructor notes for you
to look at all right the last thing I'm
going to do here is print toy stories
storyline let me save this file and then
go back to my class movie file and save
that one also and then come back again
to my entertainment center PI file now
here if everything goes correctly my
program should print out Toy Story
storyline let's run it and there it is
Toy Story storyline is getting printed
okay so in the next video we are going
to see what happens behind the scenes
when we run this piece of code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
