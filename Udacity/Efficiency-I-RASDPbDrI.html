concept I'll teach you in this course so
make sure you understand it before
moving on efficiency also called
complexity is how well you're using your
computer's resources to get a particular
job done you can normally think about it
in terms of space and time
how long does your code take to run and
how much storage space do you need let's
think about efficiency in terms of
cutting hair normally your hair would be
snipped off in clumps and you would just
compare some strands you cut to a group
you're about to cut to approximate where
your next cut goes however you could cut
one strand of hair at a time and compare
each strand to a ruler or measuring tape
to make sure the exact same amount gets
cut every single time
that's ridiculous though it would take a
crazy amount of time and it really
doesn't matter if hair is exactly
precisely cut if you could use less time
to get the job done pretty well then
you're good often the trade-offs for
algorithm efficiency are similar you
could take a slow methodical approach
but there's often a faster method that
accomplishes the same goal by reducing
repetition efficiency can rely heavily
on your creativity and your ability to
get the most done with minimal resources
but there are a lot of known tips and
tricks that you'll be expected to know
in a technical interview an interviewer
will expect you to know some common data
structures and the efficiency of doing
basic things with them as well as some
knowledge of specific well known
algorithms in this case an algorithm is
just a series of steps for solving a
problem one of my favorite moments in my
programming career was the first time I
used an algorithm to improve my code I
had a function that took hours to run on
this huge data set but after applying an
algorithm it only took seconds writing
really efficient code can come off with
another trade-off between time
efficiency and space efficiency what if
your code could run in just a fraction
of the time by storing temporary values
in a new data structure
for that decision you would need to
weigh whether the time of the person
using your code where the amount of
memory needed is more important by the
end of this course you'll have most of
the tools and knowledge you need to make
efficient code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
