first sentence my background knowledge
tells me that the number is three and
five aren't objects aren't destinations
aunt locations they are target's they're
just numbers of all these frames the
only one that's looking for just numbers
is the frame for to subtract such as
take eight as the meaning for the first
sentence so for the second sentence my
background knowledge tells me first that
I'm an agent that my briefcase is an
object and the work is a destination so
if I then try to map those three things
to the various different categories here
I find that the only one that works is
take two I am an agent my briefcase is
an object and work is a destination so
the third sentence is a good bit more
complicated I still know that I am an
agent I know that the casino is a place
of business and the five million dollars
could be considered a prize or an object
so that gets me down to take six or take
seven take six is to steal take seven is
to cheat or swindle which are subtly
different but my background knowledge of
the idea of source said that sources
were usually indicated by the
preposition from if I took five million
dollars from the casino and the casino
would be a source but I don't have from
in front of the casino here so i'm not
going to regard it as a source instead
i'm going to go with take seven that's
an interesting analysis david thank you
first of all congratulations on becoming
rich I didn't know that you're going to
become rich teaching this course of
course it has several data points to
note here one point is that you have a
lot of background knowledge associated
with the word for perhaps because you're
a native speaker of the English language
not everyone may have socially the same
kind of background knowledge before and
may not be able to disambiguate between
these two that actually gets an
underlying element of the problem as
well that these two meanings are
themselves very similar so it makes
sense that it's more difficult to
disambiguate between very similar
meanings than disambiguating between
stealing and medicating for example
another point to note here is that
although we have been discussing about
stories written in English language this
kind of analysis applies to all
languages note also that so far we have
been using sentences in the English
language but actually this kind of
analysis works irrespective the language
we are using so I'm originally from
India and my mother tongue is Hindi and
we can write the sentences in Hindi and
the same kind of analysis
work that is working here for the word
take in English this raises a few
questions might this kind of analysis
work for translation from one language
to another language if the different
languages have similar kind of
structures then this analysis might help
us translate sentences from one language
to another language it is under the
question do all languages have the same
kind of structure that enables mind to
make use of the structure of the
sentences to December great between
verbs feel free to take up that
discussion over on our forums especially
if you yourself don't speak english as a
first language you might be particularly
aware of the different structures
present in english compared to whatever
language you speak natively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
