string and the parse chart that was
created from parsing that string and
we're tasked with finding the grammar on
which that token was parched so let's
look at the problem here we have the
given string and here we have the parse
turn our strategy is going to go through
each line of the parse chart and look
through the roles that explicitly appear
for the first time say this one right
here that indicates egos two parenthesis
parenthesis is explicitly in the grammar
add those to the grammar run the parsing
algorithm and then we're going to see if
using that grammar on this token
generates this exact parse chart so
let's get started looking at chart state
0 we see six rolls right here each of
these six rolls has to be in the grammar
because no tokens have been read and
we're at the beginning of each of them
so let's add those to the grammar okay
here's the six rules we were given in
the first stage of the parsing chart and
if we run this through our parser will
see the chart that it generates is not
exactly the same so we're missing
something let's keep going here we have
the continuation of five rolls and if
you look closely there are no new rules
here these are all just shifts of the
rules that we found in charge state zero
the minus comes from the minus the plus
goes in the + and so on so let's move on
to chart 2 here we go a goes to nothing
that's new a goes to na also new and
lastly we have the to rule two rules for
any so let's put that into our grammar
if we run this grammar and a parser with
that token will see that we get the same
exact chart that we were given meaning
that we found the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
