relatively cleanly to minimize the
number of subscripts that I'm going to
mess up we're going to introduce a
notation called operator notation
functional notation and we're gonna
introduce in particular a bellman
operator so bellman operator is going to
be a mapping a transformation from value
functions to value functions like you
give me a cue function the bellmen
operator will give you back possibly a
different cue function okay so it's a
function from cue functions to cue
functions the does this operator have to
have any particularly interesting
properties we're gonna prove that it has
some properties but first let's define
what it is okay boom okay so here's how
we're going to define this bellmen
operator B we're gonna give it a cue
function and the new thing that we get
out this be applied to cue has the
property that at state action pair si
it's equal to the immediate reward plus
the discounted expected value of the
next state where we look up the value
the next state using whichever cue
function we were given as as input to
the to the operator so Q goes in B Q
comes out B Q is a new value function a
new Q function do you think you think
you get that I think I do I guess I I
don't know why we're going through this
yet oh I'm not gonna tell you that quite
yet but I just want to make sure that
you get it by quizzing you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
