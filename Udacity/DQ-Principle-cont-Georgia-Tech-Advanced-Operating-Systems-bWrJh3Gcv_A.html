for query and the rate of query that is
coming into the server this leak you
represent some sort of a system limit
for a given server capacity the product
DQ is a constant said differently for a
given system capacity we can increase
the number of clients that we are
serving if we reduce the amount of data
that we're using to process the incoming
queries that is increasing Q by
decreasing the harvest orgy or we can do
the opposite and that is we can
entertain a smaller set of queries that
is a yield will come down but we will be
able to give the complete data that is
needed for serving that query an example
would be if I'm a client that is
accessing a server for my mail I would
want to get all my mail not part of the
main so in that case I'll be happy if
the server gives me a harvest of one
even if it means that not all the
incoming clients may be served by the
server due to the capacity limitation of
the server at any point of time so as a
system administrator we have some
choices to play with the important thing
is that in giant scale services the
performance is limited by network and
not by the i/o capacity we can have as
much i owe capacity as we want by having
more hardware resources here but what we
are bound by is the network capacity so
if increase the capacity of a server we
have a choice as a system administrator
we can either increase the harvest
keeping the yield the same or we can
increase the number of clients we are
serving that is we can increase the
yield keeping d a constant that's the
knob that a system administrator can
play with in terms of dealing with
capacity increases of the server
similarly if I'm a system administrator
and some nodes in the server fail
then again we have a choice of either
decreasing the harvest or decreasing the
yield in order to deal with the reduced
DQ value of course it all depends on how
the server itself is architected if the
failures can be hidden through
replication and so on but the important
message I want to convey to you is that
this DQ represents a system constant so
far as the server is concerned in terms
of the capacity given a particular
capacity of the server DQ is fixed so as
a system administrator you have a choice
of either sacrificing yield for harvest
or harvest for yield you cannot increase
both the harvest and yield without
increasing the server capacity a
traditional measure that have been used
in servers is the notion of I ops or i/o
operations per second and these are
particularly meaningful and database
kinds of applications where the
applications at this bound but giant
scale applications are network bond and
for Network bond applications this
measure DQ is much more intuitive as to
what is going on in terms of managing
the incoming load to the server and
managing the corpus of data that the
server has to look at in order to
satisfy incoming queries another metric
that system administrators have often
used as what is called up time you may
have heard of terminologies like mean
time between failure and mean time to
repair mean time between failure is what
is the expected time between two
successive failures inside a data center
and similarly mean time to repair is f
of failure is detected how much time
does it take to bring up a failed server
that is mean time to repair and the
uptime is defined as a ratio of the
difference between mean time between
failure and mttr that is mean time to
repair and MTBF that is uptime is equal
to MTB f- mttr
/ MTBF that is up time and you want the
uptime to be close to 1 and usually up
time is measured in nines meaning oh
point nine nine nine nine five nine two
six nines and so on so you want the
uptime to be as close to one as possible
for giant scale services but again this
up time as a metric is not very
satisfying because if there are no
queries during the time that is needed
for repairing that is during the MTT are
the mean time to repair if no queries
come into the server then you haven't
made anybody unhappy in that sense the
uptime is not a very intuitive measure
of how well as server is performing it
is better to look at yield as the output
metric and the harvest again as the
output metric for saying how well a
server is able to deal with the dynamism
and scale of requests being handled by a
particular giant scale service we will
see that this DQ principle is very
powerful in advising the system
administrator on how to architect the
system how much to replicate how much to
partition in terms of the data set that
the server is handling how to deal with
failures how to gracefully degrade the
service when the volume of incoming
traffic increases beyond the server
capacity all of these are questions that
can be handled very elegantly using this
DQ principle and the key underlying
assumption in the DQ principle is that
the giant scale services are network
bound are not I oh bond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
