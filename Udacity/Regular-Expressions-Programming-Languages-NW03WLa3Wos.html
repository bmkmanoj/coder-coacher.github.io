first office hours for CS 260 to
building a web browser on your sis
instructor and I'm filling in for our
professor Wesley armor who's currently
at a conference my name is Andy I'm the
assistant instructor for CS 2 12 which
is Peter Norvig sclass on the design of
computer programs and I'm going to be
filling in for the role of the student
today and asking Peter here all of the
questions that you came up with in the
forums so let's start off the first
question we had Peter was why are we
learning regular expressions at all why
is this useful for a class on
programming languages so the class is
structured around building a web browser
and our web browser needs to interpret
HTML and the first step to do that is to
identify the parts of HTML we want to
identify what part is the beginning of a
tag the end of a tag what's a hyperlink
was just text and words and whatnot and
we're going to do that very concisely
with very with the powerful tool that is
regular expressions regular expression
allows you just write some text and it
very precisely and easily identifies
strings that can match say our tags or
hyperlinks okay and I've seen the
beginning of unit two and it seems like
that gets reintroduce there yeah we use
it a lot throughout the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
