suffixes and then we'll be done with
this bird so we're given the start
location we recover the Haitian in which
we want to place the anchor letter which
is start at the start and then add in
however much of the prefix we have it
could be the empty string could be more
if the prefix is already a word then we
want to add in a possible play the play
is starting in the start location we put
in this word but there's also this test
and this test says we want to make sure
that we've at least anchored the prefix
and what does that mean well if we go
back to our diagram if we're right here
we get passed in to add suffixes the
prefix EE well that is in fact a word be
e is in our dictionary but we wouldn't
want to say well the answer is B e
because that's not a play that was
already on the board we can't say our
play is we're making this word that's
already there we've got to add at least
one letter and so that's why when we
were defining row plays we said we're
adding suffixes but we haven't anchored
it yet so anchored is equal to false we
haven't anchored our potential prefix so
far so don't go reporting that prefix as
a valid play now in the definition of
add suffixes we say okay if it's the
first time through we're not anchored so
we're not going to return b e as a
possible play but when i do a recursive
call to add suffix i'll just have the
default value an anchor will be true i
will have played on the anchor and then
i'll be okay from that on one additional
tests here is saying if there are
existing letters already on the board
and you're bumping into them then you
have to count them so if there's a
letter already there don't report
everything up to that letter and that's
taking care of this case when we get up
to this C we can't report we can't like
say put a tee here and have B et and
report that by itself as a word because
the tea is running into the sea so we
got to continue and see what words can
we have that we have to account this see
here okay so that takes care of adding
in the play now whether or not we found
a valid play to add to our list of
results we still want to say are we
going to continue can we keep going to
the right adding on more letters well if
the pre we have so far
within the prefixes then yes we do want
to try to continue and what we'll do is
say tell me what square is in the
current position in the row if it's a
letter try to add suffixes to that to
the prefix we have so far plus the
letter if there's a letter already on
the board it's mandatory that we have to
use it otherwise if the square is empty
then we want to figure out what are all
the possible letters that we could place
into that empty square if the square is
an anchor then the anchor will tell us
what the possibilities are and remember
an anchor is a set of possible letters
so if the square is an anchor let's use
that as a set of possibilities otherwise
if the square is empty and it's not an
anchor then any letter is a possibility
so now we just go through our letters in
our hand and say if that letter is a
possibility then we want to add a new
suffix by saying let's place that letter
on to the prefix remove the letter from
our hand and continue adding suffixes
from there and when we're done with that
return the results so that's it now
we're done with that bird but let's go
back look at our test routine we had
these tests for legal prefix now if we
go into our interpreter and we run row
plays with the given hand and the row
that's this row where the hand is a be
teh KN and this is the result we get
that's an awesome result look we got the
backbench that we saw before we got all
these smaller words we can go through
and we can check that each of these make
sense they are the right ones they don't
run into any letters or do anything
wrong it's harder to check that we got
all of them right but we can still go
ahead and make this an assertion and
when we run this all the tests pass and
life is good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
