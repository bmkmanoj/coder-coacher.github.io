correct
then I'm mightily impressed with what
you've done because you've taken
something that often takes many many
classes to explain to students and
within a single class you understood the
gist of it and you wrote a piece of code
that is really non-trivial
that you can reuse many times and that's
the core of the Google self-driving cars
ability to track other vehicles here is
the line by line implementation of what
I've shown you before for the
measurement update and the prediction
and you'll find using my matrix class
that it implements step after step
exactly what I've shown you a little
non-trivial ax t we have to make a
measurement matrix or the end
measurement if we solve the problem you
have probably something like this
the error calculation the matrix S with
a transpose the common gain K with the
inverse back to my next prediction in my
measurement update and this is the
prediction step you can see it
implements exactly what I showed you in
these two equations over here now I know
program with this is involved and I'm
really impressed if you were able to do
this if you've done this you would see
something really really major you now
understand comment filters and you've
implemented a multi-dimensional Kalman
filter all on your own using a fairly
mechanical matrix class that I wrote for
you you run it and you've gotten a
really good results in which a sequence
of position estimates one two three let
you to make a prediction and understand
the velocity of the moving object so
these are the equations you just
implement it congratulations
you really understood something
fundamental here that I believe is
really essential to artificial
intelligence and to building
self-driving cars you implemented
effectively our method for finding other
cars let me put this in context
here's our Google self-driving car he is
another car our Google self-driving car
uses radar in the front bumper that
measures the distance to vehicles and
also gives a noisy estimate of the
velocity and it also uses its lasers and
again it measures the distance to other
cars but no velocities if he paid the
same situation from above he is the
Google car it is localized in the map
here's another vehicle and another one
using radars and lasers the Google car
estimates the distance and the velocity
of all these vehicles and it does so
using a common filter where it feeds and
range data from the laser and uses state
spaces like this one of the relative
distance in X&amp;amp;Y and the relative
velocity in x and y together with
straight transition matrices of the type
of just shown you to find out where
these other cars are and this is exactly
what you've just learned and program to
yourself I didn't tell you how to
extract the location by the cars from
radar and laser there's something called
a correspondence problem sometimes you
don't know which one each car is and I
won't talk a much depth about it but you
understand the gist of the solution now
and you've been able to program it so if
you're in a situation like this you can
use range data like laser data and radar
radar in come up with a rational
algorithm that takes momentary
measurements of other cars and not just
estimates where they are but also how
fast they're moving that's V D a
tremendous fees congratulations to
getting this far if you got this far in
my class I promise you you've just
digested the most difficult thing I have
to teach you in this entire class
congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
