flickr photos search method of the
flickr api this method allows us to
search for images using a text string or
for images that are geotagged near
certain latitude and longitude amongst
other things of all the methods in the
flickr api this one probably has the
most possible arguments but luckily for
us we'll only need a few let's start
with the arguments will need for a text
search the only required argument of
course is the API key but the next
argument of interest is called text the
text argument is used to find images
that have a title a description or tags
containing a text value that we provide
if we continue down the next argument
that we're going to use is called safe
search what safe search will allow us to
do is to filter results to show only
images containing content that's deemed
safe the remaining arguments are ones
that we've previously used in the
sleeping in the library app and I'll
show them all in the API Explorer now so
for text I'm going to enter the Atlanta
Braves which is my favorite baseball
team and then for safe search I'll enter
one and the last argument I'm going to
specify is for extras again we need to
use the URL underscore M value and
extras so that we get URLs for medium
images in the results and before we call
this method let's change the output type
to JSON and it looks like there are
thousands of photos for the Braves let's
just pick one I'll copy the URL into the
address bar and remove the backslash
characters that were added by flickr
remember these backslashes will get
removed when we create NS URLs and there
we go this is a picture actually of the
Braves new baseball stadium that's being
built in Cobb County Georgia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
