composition using aggregation in
particular is very common in UML class
diagrams you often want to say that one
class is related to many instances of
another class and you use the
aggregation Association to do this it's
still an association
it's just adorned with an open diamond
to indicate that it's a particular kind
of Association called an aggregation I
want to say a word though about the
difference between aggregation and
composition it's somewhat subtle and it
gets to the point that aggregation
doesn't really say much about the
semantics of the relationship in
particular it doesn't say much about the
lifetimes of the participant objects for
example let's say you had a house class
and room classes clearly a house has
rooms so you'd expect there to be an
aggregation there but think further if
you destroy the house you're also
destroying the rooms therefore instead
of using aggregation we would use
composition that is we'd fill in that
diamond in compositions there's a
responsibility for managing the lifetime
of the constituent objects that that's
further says that a particular
constituent can only belong to one
composition compositions also have the
transitive property that is a house can
have room and a room can have closets
for aggregations there's no rules like
this aggregations are general situations
we might say for example that a room has
a table now this is an aggregation
situation because we could certainly
destroy the room after taking the table
out they have separate lifetimes and
therefore we use aggregation instead of
composition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
