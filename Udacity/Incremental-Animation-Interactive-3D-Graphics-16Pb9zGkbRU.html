the render method to it last make our
drinking bird move I've gotten things
ready by structuring the geometry a bit
the bird has two parts the support which
is the legs and feet and the animated
part which is the body and head I've put
the body and head into a new object 3d
called body head next I do a thing that
JavaScript allows I create a new
parameter for the bird called animated
which I set to body hidden in this case
I want to access the animated part of
the bird in the render function so for
convenience I give it a separate
parameter adding parameters at any time
to an object is a feature of JavaScript
that said it can also be a bit annoying
at times for example if I try to set a
parameter and make a small spelling
error I'm not told that the parameter
didn't previously exist I can also
create what I think is a new name only
to find later that I'm actually using an
existing parameter long and short be
careful usually you'll find the error
eventually but the word there is
eventually here's where the animation
happens we want to rotate the body
around its z-axis the axis of the
crossbar there's a variable called tilt
direction that's either 1 or negative 1
if it's one then the rotation will
increase by a small increment half a
degree per render when the angle reaches
a maximum of 103 degrees the object
swings back the other direction by
changing tilt direction to negative 1
whatever amount the bird has moved past
103 degrees is used to move it the other
way now the rotation angle is
decremented by half a degree until a
limit of negative 22 degrees is reached
which causes it to reverse again what
we'd like to see as this result with a
drinking bird rotating around its
crossbar forward and back we get this
instead with the drinking bird rotating
around the origin the problem is that we
haven't set the body of the bird to have
a pivot point that is where the cross
bar is located</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
