Athena so let's get back to talking
about her life now Athena lives in
California in the bay area to be exact
to help orient you here is the Pacific
Ocean and here's suppose to California
here is San Francisco Bay it's a pretty
beautiful area to live in and she goes
to school in San Jose right down here
and all of these little cities lie right
along the bay now sometimes Athena likes
to take a non-stop train from San Jose
all the way up to San Francisco which is
this northern city right here along the
train line which I've drawn in red right
here are a bunch of other stations
including Sunnyvale mountain view palo
alto redwood city san mateo and millbrae
so let me ask you a question if Athena
wants to take that non-stop train
starting in San Jose and going all the
way up to San Francisco which stations
must the train pass through along the
way remember the red path here is the
train track it doesn't branch off
anywhere it just follows this path
