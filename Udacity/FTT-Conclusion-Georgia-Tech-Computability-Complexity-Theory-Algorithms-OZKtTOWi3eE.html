fast Fourier transform from a practical
perspective probably the most important
thing to remember from the lesson is
that convolution can be done in n log n
time not n squared as one might naively
think don't be needlessly intimidated by
the need to perform convolution in an
application and be aware the image and
signal processing libraries use this
technique from the perspective of
algorithm design the fast Fourier
transform falls in the category of
divide and conquer algorithms along with
merge sort and Stratton's algorithm for
matrix multiplication for those who are
familiar with those algorithms it has
some resemblance to dynamic programming
to however instead of just having one
problem we have multiple problems as we
want to evaluate a polynomial at
multiple values and the associated
subproblems overlap in a way captured by
that butterfly Network the butterfly
network by the way is a fascinating
structure in its own right and it's
sometimes used in massively parallel
computers it also serves as an important
example in graph theory another thing to
appreciate from the lesson is a strange
twists and turns that are develop of the
algorithm took we started by thinking
about the general problem of convolution
but the algorithm came much more
specifically from thinking about the
special case of polynomial
multiplication we started by only
considering sequences of integers yet
complex numbers became an essential part
of the algorithmic solution sometimes
the ideas you need come from unexpected
places so soak up as much mathematics as
you can you never know when it might
come in handy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
