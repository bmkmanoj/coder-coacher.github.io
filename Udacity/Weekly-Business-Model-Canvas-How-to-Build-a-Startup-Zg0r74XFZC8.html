be starting within week one is filling
out the business model canvas and
getting out of the building and testing
their hypotheses about the value
proposition customer segments and
chaough in the next week they'll be
testing customer relationships revenue
streams and partners and then in week 3
they'll be looking at key resources key
activities and cost structure the thing
to remember that the goal is not to draw
on the canvas the goal is to get out of
the building and use the canvas as a
scorecard for the customer development
activities that are going on in the z
axis and depth between each one of those
canvas core carts you need to make sure
your team is learning about who are
those right customers what are the right
value propositions what is the right
revenue model and it's the activity that
they're doing outside the classroom now
the real winners in this program are not
just the teams who get out and talk to
lots of customers but those who actually
turn the data into insight that is who
see patterns who realize oh it's not
that 43 people liked it it's the four
people who throw us out but said they
would have paid a lot of money maybe the
business is over there
that's what you as mentors and you as
facilitators are actually helping these
teams see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
