get interesting this camera is more like
real-life with objects in the distance
being smaller that said it uses the same
sort of pipeline as before internally
you define a view matrix exactly the
same as for the orthographic camera
however then the projection matrix is
formed differently in a perspective view
of the world objects get smaller in the
image as they get further away from the
viewer another way to say it is that if
something is farther away it needs to be
larger in world space if it wants to
appear the same size on the screen this
gives us the idea of similar triangles
y2 divided by Z 2 will be equal to y1
divided by z1 and so on so perspective
projection is going to involve division
but when we multiply a vector by a
matrix it's just some dot products a
series of multiplies and additions this
is where the fourth coordinate for our
points comes into play up to now this
fourth value has always been equal to
one we run a point through any set of
modeling transforms in the fourth
coordinate value of one is left
untouched this all changes with
perspective projection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
