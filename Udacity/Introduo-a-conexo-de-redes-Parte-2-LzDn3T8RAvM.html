the HTTP request will include the URL we
just talked about along with other bits
of information such as what action we
want to perform on the data information
about the device making the request and
more the whole request gets packaged up
together it's like sticking a message in
an envelope the HTTP request is like an
envelope with a destination and a return
address after the request is packaged
Android offers functionality to help a
send our message over the network to the
correct web server we haven't officially
defined the word network yet but you can
think of it as a digital Postal Service
a network is really just two or more
computers connected in some way that
lets them communicate and when I say
computer I mean any computing device
like a phone laptop or a server the
internet is a large-scale network
consisting of many computers around the
world and we can use the HTTP protocol
to route our requests from one computer
to the other to communicate to a
computer in a different location we must
establish communication channel also
known as a network connection across the
internet then we can exchange messages
with the other computer in this diagram
we've represented USGS as a single
computer but keep in mind that they have
a lot of data so they probably have a
whole group of computers who are
responding to requests a single computer
wouldn't be able to handle requests from
all over the world for the u.s.
geological data at this point I want to
introduce you to some more formal
terminology that you will often hear you
can refer to the USGS computers that are
providing data as the USGS web server a
web server is simply another computer or
a group of computers on a network
running a program that responds to HTTP
requests on the other hand your phone
can be referred to as the client the
client requests the information from the
server and then displays the results to
the user often many different clients
will be connected to the same server but
each client may display the data in
different ways for example a mobile
client may show information that is more
convenient to viewing on a small mobile
screen a web client on a desktop for
instance might showed more detailed
information taking full advantage of the
larger screen size each client sends out
a request to the server when the web
server receives the request it may
compose an HTML webpage to return to the
sender for display or it might return
structured data that we can use in an
app or building in a format such as JSON
or XML once the clients receive the
response from the server they control
how the data gets displayed to the users
for example a web browser can render a
web page to the screen or a mobile app
can parse out the bits of data that it
needs to show useful information on the
device screen in this lesson we'll zoom
in on major steps of the data exchange
process first we'll talk about how to
form a proper HTTP request based on the
information we want and from where we
want to get it second we'll send the
request to the server which will process
it and figure out a proper response to
send back third we'll talk about how the
client can process or parse this
response and convert it into a format
that it understands then lastly we can
update the UI in our app to show the
results to the user before we get into
the details of networking though there's
one constraint on the Android device
that we need to deal with first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
