aldh2 let's see if we can put this
information together with some of the
concepts about ancestry and inheritance
that have shown up in previous lessons
meet Dave a fictional character with an
East Asian background this is a pedigree
of Dave and his family for the trade of
alcohol flush reaction now you can see
in this pedigree Dave has an affected
mother uncle maternal grandparents lots
of extended family that are affected now
for this pedigree the a allele for aldh2
is dominant and that's what leads to the
alcohol flush reaction the G allele is
recessive where we don't see alcohol
flush now a dominant loss of function
allele means that heterozygous
individuals would actually be affected
but the homozygous phenotype is even
more severe in fact it's so severe that
some individuals avoid drinking
altogether because they feel so sick so
if Dave's mother is homozygous for the a
allele then how many of her children
will exhibit at least some alcohol flush
reaction there are three children total
do you think it would be none of the
children one two three or all of the
children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
