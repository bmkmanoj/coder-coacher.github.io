for me and we're going to change this to
work for max max as it turns out is the
name of my son because I just find this
stuff really important so in a very deep
sense the thing that we're computing is
it's functionally equivalent to the mean
it's really very very similar kind of
calculation that's happening but the
details are going to end up being a
little bit different so we're going to
start off instead of the total of zero
start off with the max so far being
whatever the first element of the list
is and then oh so we should make sure
that we don't compute that one twice
then we're going to consider all the
other elements of the list and if the
element that we're currently considering
beats the mac so far then we have a new
mac so far there can be only one and
that's what we do we just apply this
test to every element to the list
keeping track of the max so far and then
when we're done the mac so far is the
max so far of everything whoo now
perhaps not surprisingly Python you
don't want to do this you don't want to
write your own max routine because
Python already has one but just as
before you have to be really careful
when you use things like Max in your
programs keep in mind that this is a
linear time operation it's not constant
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
