an intrinsic size based on the text and
image it may contain that means we only
need two constraints to Center this
button on our view one for the
x-coordinate and one for the
y-coordinate there are two ways to add
these constraints and I'll cover both
here with the record button selected you
can click on the align button that looks
like a bar graph if you're having
trouble finding the record button
remember to use your document outline
here and select it there with the record
button selected click on the align
button which looks like a bar graph here
and then select these two options on the
bottom to Center it horizontally and
vertically in the container and then
select add two constraints we can now
see both constraints and record button
in the document outline you can expand
these triangles if you want to see them
actually here and if you're like me you
may have encountered the first on a
layout issue which is these orange lines
that you see here or this yellow
disclosure here that you can see the top
now let's fix that first before we run
it so if you click on this tiny arrow we
can see that Xcode expects that our
button beyond X of 276 width of 29 and
height of 30 and its height is 32 so if
we expand this out a little bit and
click on this one we can get it to fix
the frame that is to fix the size of the
button so it matches the constraints
that we've declared will do that we can
see its trim the record button to fit
just the text or just intrinsic size of
our button let's see if adding these
constraints works let's select the
iphone success here on the simulator
drop down and press the Run button or
hit command + R on your keyboard we
should see the record button on the
center of the screen with the iPhone
simulator selected press and hold down
the command key and then use the right
or left arrows to rotate the simulator
I'm going to use the right arrow here to
rotate it to landscape right and I can
use the left arrow to rotate back to
portrait in both orientations we can see
that our button stayed in the center now
let's try on an iPad air 2 which is on
larger than iphone 6s I move this to the
side and go back into Xcode can press
the stop button we can hear in the
drop-down select an ipad air 2 and hit
run now we have a record button but it
looks like our iPad simulator is too big
to fit on our screen what do we do we
could go out and buy a large stone the
world display and I would recommend that
we could petition Johnny I've to bring
back the 17 inch macbook pro laptop wow
there's an easier option with the iPhone
simulator selected let's go into window
and then scale and you can choose a
different size here for example let's do
thirty three percent that makes our iPad
a lot smaller and we can see it we can
use the command keys to jump around
between those sizes too for example
command three will get us a little bit
bigger come in two will get us even
bigger and outs again off screen so
we'll stick with command three here you
can see it's the record button is still
in the center of the screen even if I
use command and arrow keys to rotate the
ipad to landscape right or back to
landscape left by the way these options
just scale down the size of the iOS
simulator as a whole to what you're
seeing for your app everything is still
the same size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
