emerging here but I'm now going to
deviate just a little bit from this I'm
now going to add three vertices here
three vertices here three vertices here
three vertices here so this is a total
of twelve vertices and just so that we
that we keep that in mind here up here
we had eight here we had 12 and here we
have 24 in the slit in these layers here
now how am I going to connect those and
this is what the picture gets actually
quite messy I'm going to connect them to
all those here so each of these three
vertices here that I've added is
connected to six other vertices so there
are six edges going out here one two
three four five six and what you see
also is that each of the vertices here
in this layer the first layer that I
added is connected to exactly five
vertices so one two three four five and
of course I deliberately constructed
this in this way and I'm going to draw
these out here in a minute I just want
you to understand the principle I've
added these 12 vertices here in a way
such that the greedy algorithm will
first take these 12 here then it will
take these eight here and then it will
take these 12 here so I'm constructing
my graph so that the greedy algorithm
will choose the vertices in exactly the
reverse order that I am adding them to
the network and in that way I can make
that algorithm behave very very very
badly you would think that theoretical
computer science is a clean and not
messy science but I think I can just
show you the opposite here but you get
the principle now so these twenty four
vertices here are the first ones that
I've that have added and I've now added
these layers here so i first added these
twelve here then these eight and these
twelve here in such a way that the
greedy algorithm will choose these
vertices here to be in a vertex cover
and these here and the vertex cover so
the question of course now is can I add
even more vertices to this so that I'm
so making the greedy algorithm
take my new vertices that I add and in
fact I can but it will become really
messy to draw so I'm more going to
explain to you how I'm going to do this
rather than actually draw out every
single vertex so you see for each of the
vertices that I've added here I've
connected them to larger and larger
groups of these vertices here in the
middle of those original 24 and I can
continue this for a little bit by now
adding two vertices which would then be
connected to groups of eight down here
so this would be connected to all over
here and then I will do the same part
here so again i can add two vertices
here and i will connect them to this
group of eight and two more vertices
here and i'll connect them to this group
of eight and if you if you want you can
of course check it will still be such
that the six vertices I've now added
will be the first ones that are picked
by the greedy algorithm and then those
12 and then those eight and then those
12 what I can then do is I can add
another four vertices and this time i
will look at groups of 12 so i will add
four vertices connected to these 12 here
in the middle and i will add four
vertices connected to these 12 here in
the middle and we'll be done soon so in
case you think this gets very tedious
bear with me for just another moment
here and we'll be done so we've added
another eight vertices and again these
will be the first ones picked by the
greedy algorithm and final edition of
vertices actually I will add another 11
vertices so and these vertices will be
connected to all 24 now my question for
you is how large is a minimum vertex
cover for this network that I've
constructed here and remember every
vertex is connected to those twenty four
vertices here in the middle so please
enter the size of a minimum vertex cover
here into this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
