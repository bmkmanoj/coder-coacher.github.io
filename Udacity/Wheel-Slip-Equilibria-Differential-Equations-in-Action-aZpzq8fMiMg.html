obviously very smaller than the mass of
the quarter of that car due to its low
mass it's much easier to accelerate and
decelerate the wheel then to accelerate
or decelerate the car which has a larger
mass so when we want to study equilibria
of the wheel slip that is where use
which it stays constant we can start by
thinking about the velocity of the car
is a slow variable and the velocity of
the rim of the wheel as a fast variable
the cheat a little and say ok let's
assume that the velocity of the car is
almost constant but assuming that the
velocity of the car is almost constant
this idea about a fast-changing W and is
slowly changing V helps us to think
about the equilibria of the wheel slip
if that wheel slip reaches an
equilibrium its temporal its rate of
change becomes zero it does not change
anymore this is the meaning of
equilibrium if s doesn't change and V is
almost constant we learn that W must not
change but we have an equation for the
rate of change of W it's the friction
force divided by the effective mass of
the wheel minus through breaking this
elevation of the wheel so these two
expressions have to be equal so we found
approximately at this equation for the
equilibria of the wheel slip when the
wheel slip does not change with time the
friction force divided by the effective
mass of the wheel has to be almost equal
to the deceleration of the wheel by the
break given this equation the task is
now to determine the number of
equilibria the number of stable
equilibria and the number of unstable
equilibria for that assume that the car
is breaking slightly below the optimum
value and ignore the case that as the
wheel slip equals 1 which means perfect
locking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
