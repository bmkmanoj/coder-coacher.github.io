example of decision trees so let's make
certain that we understand it with a
concrete example so to your right is a
specific decision tree that looks at
some of the features that we talked
about whether you are occupied or not
whether the restaurant is occupied or
not what type of restaurant it is your
choices are Pizza Thai or other and
whether the people inside look happy or
not and the possible outputs are again
binary either you don't go or you do go
into the restaurant on your left is a
table which has six of the features that
we've talked about whether the
restaurant is occupied or not the type
of restaurant whether it's rainy outside
or not whether you're hungry or not
whether you're on a hot date and whether
the people inside look happy and some
values for each of those what we would
like for you to do is to tell us what
the output of this decision tree would
be in each case all right so the
decision tree here is a it's a
classifier but we had another narrow
it's a concept yeah all right and each
row of this is a different time that
we're stopping at a restaurant and the
the little values there summarize what
is true about this particular situation
and and you're saying we need to then
trace through the decision tree and
figure out what class is okay yeah
that's what you said okay I'm ready all
right perfect okay
that's the quiz go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
