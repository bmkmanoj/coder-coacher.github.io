requirements engineering we talked about
software systems but what do we really
mean when we use the term software
software is an abstract description of a
set of computations that becomes
concrete and therefore useful only when
we run the software on some hardware and
in the context of some human activity
that it can support so what does that
mean exactly
what that means is that when we say
software what we really mean is software
intensive system that is the combination
of three things the software the
hardware on which the software runs and
the context in which the software is
used just to illustrate let me show you
this through a picture what I'm showing
here is a customer a user that is using
is the accessing an ATM machine and this
action involves several things there is
the software that drives the logic of
the ATM machine there is the hardware on
which the software runs and there is the
context in which the software is used
and in this case the context is the bank
and only by considering these three
things together we can really understand
the functionality that is represented
here so the bottom line here is that we
usually take hardware and context for
granted in this equation but they
actually need to be explicitly
considered when building a system
otherwise we might forget pieces of the
functionality and ultimately of the
requirements and we might end up with
the wrong system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
