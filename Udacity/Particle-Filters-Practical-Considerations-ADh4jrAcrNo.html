efficiently the other thing is how often
do you have to resample well in the
algorithm that I showed you we resample
all the time and that's so that we have
a whole bunch of samples that are about
uniform weight and we spread them out if
I don't have too many samples that have
very large weights maybe I don't have to
resample maybe I can just you reuse the
weights that the same samples over again
right I still have to apply the
deterministic part and I have to apply
the expansion part but I don't have to
do that resampling and you can do that
by just saying let me take a look at
sort of the variation in the weights I
want them as uniform as possible and as
long as they have a certain amount of
uniformity to them
I won't resample so that reduces the
number of times you do resampling a
second problem is what if P of Z given X
what if your likelihood is incredibly
piqued remember you multiply the
likelihood times that the weights of the
samples if it's incredibly peak that
means that P of Z given x is 0 almost
everywhere else that's not very helpful
because what that means is you've wiped
out all of your your possible
predictions in general you want to allow
for noise in your P of Z given X don't
be so systematic about it
and you also might want to be better at
sort of how you do your your proposals
to begin with right so you want to make
sure that your particle filter sort of
spreads out the points to begin with and
one way of doing that actually is if you
think of a sample each sample you can
think of as having its own little mini
Kalman filter so you can think of it as
having a Gaussian that sort of spreads
itself out and goes forward in general
you're much better off overestimating
noise and let your measurements sort of
narrow you down then under estimating
noise and have your measurements think
that they're much more accurate than
they are or I should say much more
constraining than they are
another issue is recovery from failures
suppose an object really did disappear
and reappear if I have no particles
there I don't have any way of tracking
it ever so a standard thing to do is
each iteration
you randomly put out some particles
everywhere or it sort of uniformly
distributed because if my measurements
suddenly have moved over here there'll
be some particles over there and
eventually that will be the distribution
that will be tracked so those three
issues of sort of making sure you're
smart and efficient about your
resampling not letting your system think
that measurements are too precise and
making sure you have enough noise so you
don't kill off samples too quickly and
this idea of having some random samples
distributed in a useful way so you can
track things if things change very
unexpectedly all these things are
necessary to make particle filtering
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
