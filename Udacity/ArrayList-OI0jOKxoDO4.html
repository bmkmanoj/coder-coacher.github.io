limitation about a raise woody
what do you mean that's what you wanted
us to use what's wrong with it well I've
been thinking about it and there's
actually a better data structure for us
to store these words in case we want to
add more to in the future what data
structure is that well it's something
called an ArrayList and we can use these
stackable boxes as an analogy for
example if we want the ArrayList to
shrink in size we just remove elements
from it and if we wanted to grow we can
just add elements onto it okay
how big does it actually get well
there's actually no upper limit to how
big the ArrayList can get whereas with
the Ray once we create it it's stuck
that size okay so where do I put these
because I want to put the strings 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 in there mmm well the first word can
go in the first element okay second word
can go in the second element okay and
the third word will go in the third
element okay so can I put anything in an
element of an array list oh would you
put anything a realist can only hold
object data types as opposed to remember
primitive data types
things like integers boolean and floats
but what if I want to store an integer
and an element well it's kind of tricky
but in Java we have something called
object wrappers
they're wraparound primitive data types
to help them become object data types so
for example we can store the capital I
integer but we can't store the lowercase
I energy okay I got it so an ArrayList
can hold object datatypes not primitive
types it just seems like an ArrayList is
a lot more flexible cuz there's no
wasted spots as compared to an array
which could have blank spots so why not
just always use an ArrayList ooh
glad you asked so I had this wonderful
comparison chart to answer all your
questions okay
let's check it out here's the table that
compares in contrast the array and the
array lists like we mentioned earlier an
array cannot change size once it's
created whereas an ArrayList can change
size now for the question is it a class
an array is not a class it doesn't have
methods to access and modify elements on
the other hand an ArrayList has a class
definition this means that every
instance of an ArrayList is an object
which has methods we can use to access
and modify the data
and so that's showcase here and what
each data structure can store is
different as well an array can contain
primitive and object data types however
an ArrayList can only contain object
data types so to help make this clear
let's look at some example scenarios in
real Android apps within the Settings
app we have a Wi-Fi screen that shows
the list of available Wi-Fi networks
near you in this case we probably want
to store this information in an
ArrayList and this is because the list
of available Wi-Fi networks can grow or
shrink depending on where you're located
sometimes there are no Wi-Fi networks
near you and other times there might be
a ton in this case it doesn't make sense
to have a fixed size array in the
YouTube app there's a feature that can
allow you to create a playlist of videos
to watch later and this is an ideal
situation for our ArrayList because
we'll continue to add videos that we
want to see and remove those that we've
already watched and since we need the
data structure to dynamically change in
size we should use an ArrayList on the
other hand in the alarm clock app we
have a potential use case for an array
when you specify an alarm you specify
what day of the week the alarm she
repeat on this could be a boolean array
which source true if the alarm would
happen on that day and false if the
alarm should not happen on that day so
there will only ever be seven days in a
week so the size of our boolean array
will need to change over time hence we
can use an array another possible use
case for an array is the Google Play
Store app when searching for an app you
can view a list of categories which
includes businesses communication
education apps and more if you scroll up
and down the number of categories in the
Play Store will stay pretty fixed over
time so in this case we'll use an array
to store this information now to
summarize array and array lists are two
different types of data structures that
are ideal for different use cases arrays
have a fixed size while array lists have
variable size you can store objects and
primitives in our array while you can
only store object types in an array list
next we'll dive in and see how to write
code to create an ER wait list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
