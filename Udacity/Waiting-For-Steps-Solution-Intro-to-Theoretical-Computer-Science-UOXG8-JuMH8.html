calculate this so we need to know the
number of possible states that this
computer could go through in order to
know whether or not we could get to a
state we've already been to in a
reasonable amount of time so how many
states are there well each bit can be in
one of two states either one or zero and
there are eight bits per byte that's two
to the eight states per byte we have a
thousand 24 bytes in our memory we have
a kilobyte of memory that gives us two
to the AIDS the 1024 power which is 10
to the 2466 so this is a huge number
already this is just the possible states
in our memory now how many can we go
through in a year well we take 10
billion steps per second so 10 billion
steps per second is 10 to the ninth
steps per second now how many seconds in
here well this is just multiplying by 60
seconds in a minute I'm 60 minutes in an
hour x 24 hours in a day times 365 point
two five days in a year and this equals
10 to 17 point five states that we can
calculate in a year so that means that
really what we want to do is take 10 to
the 2466 states and / this one year over
10 to the 17 point five states and this
gives us 10 to the two thousand four
hundred and forty eight point five years
this is an insanely huge number and this
is for a computer that only has a
kilobyte of total memory the sheer
number of states that we can be in even
in such a small memory and especially in
a larger memory like you would see in a
computer today is just so massive that
calculating decidability in this fashion
isn't actually feasible so this is why
we still really care whether a problem
is undecidable theoretically or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
