second equation since we would need to
move the terms around and / a
coefficient in front of the variable for
example if we try to solve for x we
would have to subtract 3y from both
sides first and then divide every term
by five that's kind of messy a similar
process happens if we try and solve for
y so these two are out if we try to
solve for x in this first equation we
have to divide each term by 2 this would
leave me with X is equal to 2 minus
one-half why remember there's a one as a
coefficient in from the Y so this is
really negative one-half times why I
prefer to avoid working with fractions
in my substitution process so this X
isn't necessarily the best choice if I
try and solve for y I could add why to
both sides then rewriting my problem up
here i could subtract 2x from both sides
and i would get y is equal to negative
2x plus 4 because I've integer
coefficients like negative 2 and 4 it's
easier to work with this in a
substitution if you want to solve for x
and work with a fraction in your
substitution that's okay choose the
method that you feel most comfortable
doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
