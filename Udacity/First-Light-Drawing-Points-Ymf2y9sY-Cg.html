demo loaded up let's see what we got
here well first what we've got is a
readme file that actually contains the
text version of everything I've said so
far this level so if you need a
refresher well you know where to find
one to find the real meat of the demo
though let's open up the to do pain down
at the bottom find a nice entry that
says to do start here to learn more
about application listener and shape
renderer sounds good let's close the
rest of these pains so we have some room
to work with if you open up this file on
your own machine you may notice that
there's a whole bunch more comments on
here and again that's more or less the
text version of what I'm about to tell
you so the entry point into your code
that you write for a game is a class
that implements application listener
application listener has six required
methods that will walk through we've
also inserted logging messages that fire
when each of those methods is called so
in this demo first thing we're setting
up a tag so that we can identify our log
messages and then we declare a private
shape renderer create is the first one
of the required methods on an
application listener and that's
basically where you do anything you do
in a normal constructor this will get
called when the host application is
ready for your application listener to
come alive and of course this is where
we initialize our shape renderer
immediately after our application
listener is created resize will be
called to let us know how big the screen
is we won't be doing anything with
resize just for now but next level will
be using it to make sure our camera
doesn't go out of whack next we have the
dispose method now you might be thinking
this is Java don't we get automatic
memory management I thought garbage
collection was a thing well while it's
true that Java can usually be relied
upon to clean up your memory for you a
garbage collection event takes a long
time and when you have a game that's
trying to render itself 60 times a
second a garbage collection event can
easily make you drop a whole ton of
frames that makes it look like the game
is just frozen and users don't like that
so there's a number of places where we
have to manage our own memory in this
case when our application listener
receives a call to dispose we should
dispose of any resources that we are
using all right the render
method this is the real heart of the
operation this gets called every time
our game should draw itself so you know
how I said we didn't have to talk to
OpenGL directly well that's mostly true
these two lines clear the previous
screen these lines get repeated pretty
much verbatim at the start of every
render method throughout this course the
first line tells OpenGL hey what's the
background color in this case it's black
that's opaque and the second line
actually tells OpenGL to go ahead and
clear the screen all right then we tell
shape renderer to start a new batch and
we passing the shape type we want to
draw in this case we want to draw points
then we draw a point at location 100 100
so that's going to be a hundred pixels
up from the bottom of the screen a
hundred pixels to the right of the left
of the screen and then we got to
remember to end or shape renderer batch
pause is the second last of the required
application listener methods and it gets
called right before our application is
disposed of it can also be called when
our appt goes off screen and is no
longer active this will usually happen
in Android when you hit the home button
pause is where we want to save anything
we want to persist about the game like
how many lives the player has left zoom
gets called if the game comes back to
life after being paused again this is
pretty much an Android specific thing
and we'll talk much more about this
later alright so we expect this code to
draw a single point to the screen let's
give it a try alright it's not much but
there we go we've got a single point
illuminated it's kind of pretty kind of
like a star in the night sky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
