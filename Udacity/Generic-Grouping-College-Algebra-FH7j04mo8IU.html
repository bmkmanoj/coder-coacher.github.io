x-intercepts of this equation that we
didn't know how to factor but this is a
pretty long-winded process unfortunately
this is a situation that we actually run
into quite a bit it's really only very
special cases of quadratic equations
that we can factor thankfully there's a
formula that we can use to calculate the
roots of a quadratic equation so we
don't have to go through this long
process every single time now get
excited because you are going to work
out that formula yourself we're going to
start with a general form of a quadratic
equation ax squared plus bx plus c
equals 0 and we're going to use this to
solve for x this might look a little bit
complicated at certain points but once
you've gotten to the end and you
understand why the formula we end up
with works you'll get to use this every
single time let's follow the same method
as you did in the last example first
things first let's complete the square
might be a little bit messy but we're
going in the first thing I'd like you to
do is to factor out a from these first
two terms here what belongs inside these
parentheses done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
