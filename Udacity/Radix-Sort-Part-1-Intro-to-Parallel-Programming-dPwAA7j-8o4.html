algorithm so far but the GPU performance
leader is none of the ones that we've
discussed today instead typically on the
GPU for the highest performing sorts we
use a different sorting algorithm called
radix sort now all of the previous
sorting algorithms were comparison sorts
meaning the only operation we did at an
item was compare it to another one radix
sort relies on a number representation
that uses positional notation in this
case bits are more significant as we
move further left in the word and it's
most easily explained using integers so
the algorithm for radix sort is as
follows start with the least significant
bit of the integer split the input into
two sets those that have a zero with
this particular bit location and those
that have a 1 otherwise maintain the
order then proceed to the next least
significant bit and repeat until we run
out of bits so as usual we're going to
do an example that'll make more sense
and we're going to use unsigned integers
so what we're going to sort is this
column of numbers to the left and here
is the binary representation of those
numbers and so we're going to start here
with the least significant bit so the
way that we're going to do this is take
all the elements that have a 0 as the
least significant bit and we're going to
otherwise maintain their order but we're
going to put them up top then we're
going to take all the rest of the
elements those that have a 1 as the
least significant bit and we're going to
again keep them in order and append them
to the list that we've just created so
what this creates is a list where all
the least significant bits are 0 and
then a list where all the least
significant bits is 1 now we move to the
next least significant bit okay so the
bit in the middle and we're going to do
the same thing we're going to take all
the zeros and put them up top and then
we're going to take all the ones and put
them below and here the dotted lines are
just showing the data movement that
we're looking at the green lines are the
ones where the middle bits are 0 and the
blue line is the one where the middle
bits are 1 now we move on to the next
most significant bit in this case the
very most significant bit and we do the
same operation again zeros in the most
significant bit move up top ones move to
the bottom otherwise we maintain the
order and now we have a sorted sequence
pretty cool huh now there's two big
reasons this code runs great on GPUs the
first is a
to work complexity the best comparison
based sorts of n log n this algorithm on
the other hand is o of K n meaning the
runtime is linear in two different
things
first it's linear in the number of bits
and the representation so this
particular integer has three bits in its
representation and it took three stages
for us to be able to sort the input
second it's linear in the number of
items to sort so we have eight items in
the representation here and so the
amount of work is proportional to a
generally K is constant say a 32-bit
word or a 64-bit word for any reasonable
applications and so in general the work
complexity of this is mostly
proportional to the number of items that
we need to sort and so that's a superior
work complexity to any of the sorts that
we've talked about to date and so that's
one reason why this looks so good
the second is that the underlying
operations that we need to do this split
of the input at each step are ones that
are actually very efficient and in fact
there are efficient operations that you
already know let's take a closer look at
what we're doing we're only going to
look at the first stage of the radix
sort algorithm where we're only
considering the value of the least
significant bit and we're only going to
look at the output for which the least
significant bit is zero now what are we
actually doing here we've already
learned an algorithm that does this
operation today so what is the name of
the algorithm that takes this input and
creates that as the output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
