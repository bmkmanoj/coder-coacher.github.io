this all-powerful universal Turing
machine as input to the universal
machine we give the description of the
machine we want to simulate and the
input we want to simulate it on these
two things separated by half the goal is
to simulate Em's execution when given
the input W that means we loop accept or
reject just as M would on W and if M
does halt we want the universal machine
to output the encoding of the tape
contents that M would have on W will
describe a three tape turing machine
that achieves this goal of simulating m
on w the input comes in on the first
tape and here i've just written out the
mathematical description and first we'll
copy this description to the second tape
and we'll put the initial State on the
third tape for example the tape contents
might end up like this
then rewind the heads and begin the
second phase of actually simulating the
execution here we search for the
appropriate tuple in the description of
the machine the first element has to
match the current state stored on tape
three and the symbol part has to match
the encoding on tape one if no match is
found then we just halt the simulation
and put the Universal machine in an
accepting or rejecting state according
to the current state of the machine
being interpreted if there is a match
however then we apply the changes to the
first tape moving the head to the right
position and so forth and then repeat
this process so actually interpreting a
Turing machine description is
surprisingly easy we've just seen how
Turing machines are indeed
reprogrammable just like real world
computers this lends further support to
the church-turing thesis but it also has
a significance beyond that since the
input to a Turing machine can be
interpreted as a Turing machine this
suggests that programs are a type of
data but arbitrary data can also be
interpreted as a possibly invalid Turing
machine so is there any difference
between data and program I'll leave this
for you to discuss with your friends
over lunch or in the forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
