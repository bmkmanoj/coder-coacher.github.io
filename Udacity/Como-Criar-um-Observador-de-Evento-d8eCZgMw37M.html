understanding of why onclicklistener
is an interface with an abstract method
called on click your role as the
developer is to set up the event
listeners for the input events you want
to handle in your app more specifically
for each listener you will need to
follow three steps number one define the
event listener and a custom behavior for
when the event happens number two create
a new object instance of the event
listener by calling the constructor and
number three attach the listener to the
view you want to listen for events on
and I'll show you the code you need at
each step first we need to define an
event listener class that implements the
interface you can call it anything you
want as long as it follows the Java
conventions for naming classes in this
case we name the class numbers click
listener and this code is located in a
new file called numbers click listener
Java when we define the numbers click
listener class the declaration should
say public class followed by the name of
the class followed by the word
implements and then the interface name
which is onclicklistener in this case so
note that implements is a Java keyword
that has a special meaning and you can
find a list of these special keywords in
the Java Oracle documentation here we
use implements to express that the
numbers click listener class will
support the specified interface and
provide code for all its abstract
methods by implementing the onclick
listener interface for every piece in
the Android code that expects an
onclicklistener object type we can use
the numbers click listener and write
before the method we have this at
override annotation this means that we
are overriding the blank method in the
interface and providing our own
implementation our implementation of the
onclick method is that we want a toast
message to pop up that says open the
list of numbers we could have provided
any other custom behavior here this was
just an example once we define our
numbers click listener class we need to
create an object instance of it if you
remember from the last course we have
the class template but we need to create
object instances of it
we just created a floor plan but we need
an actual house remember back to the
syntax for creating an object using a
constructor to create a numbers click
listener object instance we can call the
constructor for the class with the new
keyword
this creates a new object that we can
store in this variable on the left hand
side where the variable is of this
datatype within the me walk app this is
what the code looks like in the main
activity file we modify the main
activity so that we can immediately
start listening for click events as soon
as the activity is created we're
creating a new numbers click listener
object and storing it in a variable
called click listener which is of the
variable datatype numbers click listener
so once we have an object instance of a
numbers click listener we need to attach
it to the view that we want to listen
for clicks on and this is the code for
that assuming we have the view stored as
a variable called button view we just
need to call the set on click listener
method on that view and pass in one
parameter argument the click listener
variable well how do we know to call
this method with this particular input
argument back to our handy-dandy
documentation hero we'll take a look at
the view class and it has a method
called set on click listener where you
pass in an on click listener since the
numbers click listener implements this
interface it is also considered an
onclicklistener datatype and we can pass
that in as an input to the method now
let's see what the code looks like
within the context of the app however
you won't need to make these changes
just yet the quiz in the next video will
give you more specific instructions on
what we need to do so just follow along
and try to understand the logic so here
I've created a numbers click listener
class and defined it in its own Java
file remember that we specify the
package name in the code so that our
code is bundled under this unique
package name then we have the import
statements because we're using the view
and toast classes and we can use them
even though we didn't create them
ourselves because we're importing them
then in the class declaration we have
implements view onclicklistener
and I'd like to point out that we add
view onclick listener to be very
explicit they were referring to the
onclick listener that is part of the
view Java file in this package and
recall that we use the dot operator to
access Java class members so here in the
numbers click listener I've created an
on click method and in it I've said that
when the numbers category is clicked on
we choose to display a toast message
that says open the list of numbers and
there you
of it this is the numbers click listener
now I'm going to switch over to the main
activity and at the end of the oncreate
method we need to create a new click
listener object now we need to attach
the click listener to the numbers
category view however first we need to
find that view object in the view
hierarchy and this process should be
familiar to you from the just Java app
in the last course so here's how we're
going to write that code so to find the
view that shows the number of category
so here I call the find view by ID
method and request the view with the ID
numbers so once we find the text view we
can store it in a variable that I'm
going to call numbers then we can call a
set onclicklistener method on this
textview
and pass the click listener object as
the input so here's how that would look
so here we set the set onclicklistener
method on the textview in passing the
click listener object as its input so
the textview numbers in our case will
store the click listener object and
later if this textview is pressed the
click listener jumps into action in
order to test that this Java code I
wrote actually works I have to delete
some owed code that we wrote for the
button click so in the activity
underscore main XML file I'll need to
delete the Android on-click attribute on
the numbers textview so in the main
activity I also need to remove the open
numbers list method and this leaves the
main activity with one method the
oncreate method now when I run the app
on my device clicking that numbers
category pops up a toast message great
now why click listener code is working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
