there's a relationship between the class
NP and the class of problems that are
solvable in exponential time any problem
that's in NP is also going to be
solvable in exponential time so the set
of exponential time solvable problems
includes NP now that by-by includes I
mean that it takes at most exponential
time none of the problems in NP can be
any harder than that say requiring
double exponential time or factorial
time or whatever it happens to be they
can all be solvable in exponential time
so if a problem is in NP that means it
has a there's a bound on the size of the
certificate needed say it's polynomial n
to the C for some constant that's
specific to this problem
where n is is related to the size of the
input and there is also a bound on the
running time of the verification
algorithm like n to the K where again n
is related to the size of the input and
K some constant that can depend on the
problem but it can't depend on the input
well if we have those two things we can
actually create a problem an algorithm
that can solve the problem for any input
so what it needs to do is we can just
run through all the certificates that
could possibly be relevant for for input
X and for each one we run the
verification algorithm and if the
verification algorithm ever says oh yeah
that's something that's that shows that
X is true then we can return true as the
solution for the problem and if we run
through all the possible certificates
and none of them make the accepting the
verification algorithm return true then
we can return false and the running time
of this algorithm is well the number of
times we go through this loop is like 2
to the N to the C if we imagine the
certificate is or the size of the
certificate is written down in bits this
is the number of different assignments
of bits to certificates of this size so
if we run through all possible ones of
those we know that we've checked
everything and then for each of those
the running time is on the order of n to
the K so the total running time is like
n to the K which is a polynomial times 2
to the N to the C which is exponential
so the total running time is exponential
it's not worse than exponential it's not
great this is unless unless we're
talking about problems that are really
tiny this is going to be horrible but
sometimes problems really are tiny and
mostly I'm introducing this as a way of
just connecting these two concepts of
the class NP and what it means to be
able to run in exponential time so it's
nice to know that at least any problem
that's in NP is solvable right we could
write an algorithm that would would run
it it's just that that algorithm may
take a very very long time to complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
