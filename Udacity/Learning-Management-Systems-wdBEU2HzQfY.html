collections of tools that are meant to
help teachers and educators with the
administration of their classrooms they
take a lot of things that traditionally
we may have done in person or done by
hand and put them online or put them on
a computer in order to make things
easier or to help with distributed
classrooms like the ones we have here in
the OMS program they might have things
like a grade book or a facility for
collecting assignments or a workflow for
grading assignments by now you're very
familiar with one particular learning
management system which is t square
you've seen t-squares assignment system
its announcement system its resources
system its tests and quizzes system
maybe these are all different tools that
are collected together under one
management system in order to try and
deliver a cohesive classroom environment
even though we use a lot of tools here
the ultimate goal of learning management
systems is to put a lot of things
together of course one difficulty with
learning management systems is it's easy
to approach them from a purely system
perspective it's easy to look at them as
software solutions to a software problem
but that actually can be a little bit
dangerous to design good learning
management systems we need to have some
understanding of the learning process as
well we need to have some understanding
of the pedagogy behind learning
management systems we have some
understanding of the learning behaviors
in which students will engage while
they're using our systems so that's what
we'll talk a lot about here not only
what a learning management system needs
to be able to do but how to design it in
such a way that actually helps learning
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
