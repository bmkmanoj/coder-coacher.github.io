what we talked about before was it at
the bottom layer is the hardware layer
I'm not completely sure what the
hardware of Watson looks like but I
assumed there has to be a physical
computer there somewhere at the next
layer the algorithm layer Watson has
some general searching and
decision-making ability that allows him
to search over his knowledge base and
come to decisions these are general
abilities that are separated from
whatever individual thing he's trying to
think about right now then at the top
layer we can think about exactly that
what he's trying to think about right
now so the task here might be answering
the inputted clue this would involve
searching on the individual information
in the clue processing his knowledge
specifically about that data and then
coming to an answer specifically for
that clue there was a good answer David
so again d three layers and note that in
the past layer here answering the
inputted clue knowledge is also a part
of it knowledge that Watson must have in
order to be able to answer that
particular question how that knowledge
is implemented what kind of
representations it uses goes in the
second layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
