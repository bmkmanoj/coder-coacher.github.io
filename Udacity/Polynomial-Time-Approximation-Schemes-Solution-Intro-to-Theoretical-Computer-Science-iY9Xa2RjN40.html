subjective but I think from just looking
at the strategies that these two
algorithms use here it seems as if the
greedy algorithm should perform much
better because it always tries to cover
as much as possible in each round while
this one appears seems well almost a bit
stupid because it just takes any edge
and always blindly puts both end points
into the vertex cover although actually
just one endpoint would be needed to
cover that edge you may already be
guessing that I ask you this question
because I'm now going to show you the
exact opposite because it's the case
that although this algorithm here seems
better and the strategy appears to make
more sense actually from a point of
approximation quality at least if you
consider the worst case this algorithm
appear take two is actually the better
algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
