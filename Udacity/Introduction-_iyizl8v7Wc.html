interesting fairly short course we've
primarily built it up you'll learn more
about backbone j/s backbone Jas is a
library that helps you organize your web
applications for completely new to
organizing web applications consider
going through JavaScript design patterns
first I've put a link to that course in
the instructor notes now I'm going to be
honest with you learning about backbone
is an important objective for this
course but it's not my only objective
the other objective I have is for you to
refine your ability to learn new things
by exploring resources on the internet
this is a critical trait to have for any
professional web developer so here's how
the course is going to work we've
curated a list of resources from the
internet things you might find in a
Google search to help you get more
familiar with backbone spend the time to
really go through each resource now
trust me on this these resources will
help you get better I've read them all
myself and they're all pretty good also
don't rush you'll be spending between 30
and 90 minutes on each one for each
resource we also will give you the
opportunity to engage with your peers
ask and answer each other's questions
teaching is another incredible way to
solidify your own knowledge so help each
other out once you're done with these
resources you'll be in a great place to
tackle your next project now let's dive
into those resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
