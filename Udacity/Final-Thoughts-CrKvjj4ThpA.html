transport yourself back in time about
ten years back I guess when you were
here and if there's anything interesting
you recall from the time that you spent
with us I would say that would impress
me the most was the talent of the
students they worked with that the
talent of the faculty that I worked with
their passion for the discipline of
computer science for information
security in particular the fact that
they treated me as a professional
colleague and really I learned as much
as much as I could humanly learn didn't
sleep much during that time that would
encourage those listening whether
they're doing this full time or part
time at night just drink deeply from the
well while you have this opportunity and
really when you're done to understand
that this this is a constantly evolving
space and that you need to not stop
learning you have to continually feed
your mind with new information new
knowledge I have advised many PhD
students but you clearly stand out in
that one respect the uncommon arming
discipline that you brought to the
academic environment that we have here I
thank you for coming down today and
having this conversation with us you
actually have a website isn't it so my
personal one is Greg can t calm and
actually that's a good point it's
important to have I think a professional
presence online something that research
or controls themselves and then my
professional website is cyber army mil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
