we've been working on and we've got to
do two things we need to need to make a
thanks handler we need to add the thanks
URL and we need to redirect to the
thanks URL okay let's let's go ahead and
do these here we are we have our the
functions you're familiar with our
normal form handler let's go down to the
bottom of our file and add a new handler
I've added the the definition for the
thanks handler this has the same
structure as our other handler it has a
name and then it inherits from web app
to request Handler and we're gonna add a
get function to it for get requests and
and we're gonna take this behavior from
here and move it down here okay now we
have our handler let's do the redirect
here so instead of printing you know
thanks we're gonna redirect self
redirect to slash thanks this is how you
do redirects in Google App Engine you
call the function redirect on self in a
handler and it'll redirect you to the
URL that you provide we don't have to
say HTTP here because we're redirecting
to the same domain so we can just
specify the path and we need to do one
final thing we need to add the Thanks
URL we need to map it to this handler so
let's go ahead and do that okay I added
another URL down here in our in our
mapping area and map slash thanks to the
thanks handler let's go ahead and test
this in the browser we reload our page
we enter in a valid date and we click
Submit
now remember submit is going to give us
a redirect instead of just sending us
data in the post and here we go we we
are now at slash thanks and our web
application is saying thanks and now we
can reload this page as much as we want
and we don't get any silly uh you know
resubmit this form things I can share
this link with my friends and say look
how smart I am I know my birthday and
they will be suitably impressed and the
server won't have to validate our form
over and over again okay that's it for
basic forms thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
