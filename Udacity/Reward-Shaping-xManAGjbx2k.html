everything not everything so we we
handled the two relatively easy cases
though that second one I admit this was
a little bit more of a workout the the
next one is going to be conceptually
trickier but the algebra is not going to
be much worse and and this is going to
be in the context of reward shaping so
have you heard this phrase reward
shaping before that it comes up often
when people are talking about wow how
did they train that dolphin to jump
through a hoop so it's tricky to imagine
how you how you might have gotten a
dolphin to jump through a flaming hoop
out of the water and then splashing down
on the other side because it's not the
kind of thing where if you were gonna
train it you can't tell it what to do
cuz they tend not to listen unless you
go and you can't reward it just for
having done the right thing because if
you have this flaming hoop up in the air
and you just wait for the dolphin to
dive you know to jump through it and you
give it a treat you know plus one if it
does it and otherwise you just don't
give it a treat it's never gonna figure
that out it's never gonna inadvertently
kind of hop through that hoop and say
hey do I get a reward so so how do you
suppose they actually trained dolphins
to do this I have no idea but I'm gonna
guess about how they do this because I'm
not as into dolphins as you apparently
are and so I'm assuming they do is they
have to coax the dolphin to jump through
the hoop in the first place by making it
worth his or her while to do so you kind
of reward it maybe for jumping first and
then getting near the hoop without the
fire with the fire you just keep giving
it you know kind of rewards for getting
close enough until it rather than
inadvertently jumping through the hoop
decides that that must be the right
thing to do now yeah I think that's some
approximation of what I imagined that
they do my understanding is that they'll
start off with something like you put
the hoop in the water and you put a fish
next to the hoop right so that the
dolphin swims over and eats the fish and
then you start saying to the dot well
you start changing when you pay off the
dolphin you don't give it fish for just
touching the hoop or for being near the
hoop you pet you give it a fish for
actually touching it with its nose and
then you lift it out of the water a
little bit and then it has to you know
swim faster to get up to it and then you
lift it out of the water a little more
and
to jump all the way through and then
yeah once it's all the way at the top
eventually you can light it on fire I
guess I actually don't think I've ever
seen a dolphin jump during a flaming
hoop so we might want to extinguish some
of that but anyway that's not really the
point the point is that it's this this
series of mini rewards along the route
to the big payoff that that helps
provide the right kind of hints grad
school Shea I'm gonna say life like that
you don't have to just say grad school
like most of the things that we do are
like this we don't we don't wait to get
the big reward after we've inadvertently
done the desired behavior we get we get
hints along the way you've clearly never
met any of my students but okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
