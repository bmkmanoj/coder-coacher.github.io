thirds and positive three apps fantastic
work if you found these two answers
factoring is one of those important
skills that will come up again and again
so let's make sure that we know how to
do this i'm going to subtract 5x from
both sides and 6 from both sides i
perform the same operation on both sides
and i'm just showing these two steps at
once this leaves me with 0 on the left
and 6x squared minus 5x minus 6 on the
right i also know i want to subtract on
both sides here since I want the x
squared term to have a positive
coefficient it's generally easiest to
factor when this term is positive so
I've taken my equation and I've
rewritten it up here to factor this part
of the equation we need to find the
factors of negative 36 that sum to
negative 5 these numbers are negative 9
and positive 4 so we can rewrite our
middle term and factor by grouping this
gives us factors of 3x + 2 + 2 X minus 3
now that the right hand side of our
equation is factored we can use the zero
product property and set each factor
equal to zero solving for x and this
equation will get X is equal to negative
two-thirds and solving for x in this
equation will get x is equal to three
halves the last thing we want to do for
our solution set is to make sure we
check the excluded values we know for
these denominators X cannot equal zero
or else we would have fractions that
would be undefined since that both of
these values are not 0 we can rest
assured that this is our correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
