amount of money and split it into fifths
notice that one whole circle is five
fifths I'm going to save two fifths of
my money so let's show that on another
circle and I'm gonna save two fifths of
my total money I don't know how much
total money i have but i know i'm saving
this fraction of money i'm trying to
figure out what fraction i have left
that i can still spend visually i can
see that i still have three fifths of my
money to spend so how did I get that I
did five fifths that was the whole
amount of money i had and i need to
subtract off two fifths so i have five
fifths minus two fists so i'm taking
away two fifths from my five miss so i
just need to subtract the numerators so
five fifths take away two fifths leaves
me with three fifths I work with
subtracting fractions just like I do
with adding fractions I only change the
numerators all I'm doing is taking my
fists and taking out two of them leaving
me with three fifths if you got three
fifths nice work whether you know it or
not you've already started thinking
algebraically I have no idea how much
money you can earn in a month but we let
that amount represent the circle it was
an abstract form of reasoning we knew
that if you saved two fifths of it that
you would have three fifths of it left
to spend on whatever you please so even
though i don't know the total amount of
money i can still say at least what
fraction of that money can be spent one
of the key skills in algebra is to find
ways to work with unknown amounts or
numbers will see this throughout the
entire course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
