textures to modify the surfaces
parameters in the lighting equation
another way to vary the surface while
calculating illumination is to apply
textures as light sources we've seen how
a skybox can be made to surround a scene
an extremely clever technique is to have
surfaces reflect a skybox this technique
is called reflection mapping there
sometimes environment mapping the basic
idea is to make one object surrounding
the world something that other objects
can reflect this is called the
environment map the illumination process
is a bit like ray tracing where array is
reflected off a shiny surface and picks
up a color of any reflective objects the
difference is that there's only one
simple object to reflect typically a
cube map unlike a skybox the environment
map is used only when a shiny surface
needs a reflected color you can
certainly also put a skybox in a scene
using the same cube map this is commonly
done in order to produce a convincing
effect however the environment map is a
separate object that is part of the
shiny objects material description that
said skyboxes and reflection maps work
using the same idea you can think of a
skybox as a physical object which is
what we usually do or you can think of
it as a texture function what is the
color of the sky box in the direction
the eye is looking an environment map is
exactly the same only for reflected rays
what is the color of the environment map
in the reflected direction how it works
is this we render a fragment on a
reflective surface such as a sphere we
compute the usual elements as desired
such as diffuse ambient and so on for
the environment map we also need the
direction to the eye and the shading
normal at the fragment these two vectors
are used to compute the reflection
direction which is then used to find the
texel on our environment map this
textile color can then be blended into
the final color of the fragment the
color from the reflection map makes the
surface appear mirror like the very
simplest cube map to reflect is one
that's at infinity remember how a
directional light came from a certain
direction but was considered infinitely
far away directional lights are
inexpensive to use because their
direction vector never changes for any
surface similarly if you define an
environment map as being at infinity
you're saying that no matter where I am
in my virtual world when I look a
certain direction I want to always get
the same color back from my environment
map to sum up the reflection Direction
is computed for a reflective surface in
this direction is then used to access
the
arman map this algorithm has limitations
somewhat the reverse of the skybox the
reflected objects are always seen as
being infinitely far away for example
say you have a reflective sphere in a
room represented by an environment map
in a skybox if you move the sphere from
the center of the room to near a wall
the reflection of the wall will not look
closer that said reflection mapping is
an inexpensive way to add convincing
visual detail to a model our eyes are
usually not very good at reversing the
process of reflection we see something
reflected in our brains interpret the
object reviewing as being shiny we don't
waste brain power trying to figure out
if the reflections are perfectly correct
since in the real world they always are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
