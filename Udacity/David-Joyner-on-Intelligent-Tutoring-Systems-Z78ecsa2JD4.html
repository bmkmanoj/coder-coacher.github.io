interviews that I've done here at
Udacity you'll notice that I'm now in
the other chair and the reason is that
what we're talking about today is
subject near and dear to my heart it's
my dissertation topic which is
intelligent tutoring systems so Jason
has graciously offered to interview me
on this one so so alright David let's
let's get started
so what got you interested in working in
intelligent tutoring systems so from the
time I was about 16 until throughout my
PhD I was actually worked as a private
tutor so I tutored mostly high school
subjects math physics things like that
and it was late in my master's degree
when I became acquainted with a field
called intelligent tutoring systems and
it was basically that's build AI agents
that can do the tutoring and the
opportunities offered by them were
absolutely enormous for accessibility
availability cutting costs and be able
to distribute these things to a large
number of students has I really wanted
to jump on board plus I always joke that
if anyone was going to replace me with
an AI agent it may as well be me so my
initial interest was really wanting to
bring the the benefits of tutoring
one-on-one tutoring where you have real
individualized feedback individualized
attention to a much broader audience of
students that wouldn't be able to access
it otherwise okay alright what is the
most exciting possibility of intelligent
tutoring systems so we've already seen
intelligent tutoring systems do some
really exciting things and things like
carnegie learning some cognitive tutor
for algebra in high school and things
like that but what I think is the most
exciting opportunity is what the
Internet can do to actually scale these
things up ok so right now we have
students using them in classrooms and
they use them as complements to their
lessons but some new initiatives are
looking at actually putting them online
which is really powerful because it
takes that and makes it available to
everyone so things like I excel to do
some rudimentary kind of intelligent
tutoring system principles for the
masses but what's really really exciting
this is a little bit further out though
is the idea that in the future we might
not just have intelligent tutoring
systems that can kind of monitor what
you do and give you feedback that it
already kind knows about but intelligent
tutoring systems that themselves can
learn so if I have a intelligent
tutoring system equipped with some
machine learning that can look at a
hundred thousand students and look at
what feedback it gave to what mistakes
and what actually led to future
improvement it can actually then improve
itself it can learn what teaching
strategies or what feedback or what
responses are most useful to students
for certain kinds of error
and it might be able to start to unlock
some principles of feedback or some
principles of teaching that we don't
even know about yet when I was tutoring
back in my earlier life I've worked with
maybe ten students at a time I probably
worked with 50 or 60 students over the
course of my career and you know I drew
from that a lot but 50 or 60 students
it's a decent knowledge base but if we
had an AI agent that could do it based
on a hundred thousand students or a
million students and experiences across
you know the entire course of their
curriculum that would be incredibly
powerful absolutely and the other thing
is that when I'm working with students
usually get them maybe ninth or tenth
grade and very often what I would find
is that the difficulties they were
having with a certain concept in math in
tenth grade really went back to
difficulties they had with fractions in
fifth grade okay and really you know the
idea would be a system like this would
prevent those difficulties from arising
the first place it would teach them well
in fifth grade but even if it didn't do
that if we had a intelligent tutoring
system that you know worked with them
throughout their entire education it
would be able to look back and say what
did I teach you back in fifth grade what
difficulties do you have there and can i
leverage those right now I know that the
student has always had a little bit of
trouble with fractions so when I come to
a new lesson I know that I can
anticipate giving a little more feedback
on that and couching it in terms of what
I've told them in the past so that kind
of long term memory that kind of massive
databank really opens up some really
exciting possibilities if we can figure
out a way to harness it oh wow
absolutely what are some of the biggest
challenges facing intelligent tutoring
systems so I think there's really two
big challenges that are presently facing
intelligent tutoring systems one is the
idea of invisible information so when
I'm working with a student and they're
working a particular problem I can see
you know the steps they're writing out
that they did as a first step as a
second step but when they make an error
I don't necessarily know what was going
on inside their mind I can kind of use
what they said and use what they wrote
to try and extrapolate it but I don't
have a real notion of that um that comes
up in things like algebra but it's even
more important in things like science or
some of the more high level classes and
ideally we'd like to be able to build
intelligent tutoring systems that deal
with those levels as well um when the
nature of the problems themselves
becomes much less formal and much less
structured than an algebra problem I
know that there's you know five steps to
get to the answer to this problem but if
my problem is
design a good user interface for
facilitating learning sign language
mm-hmm
I don't know what the problems are I
know what the steps are I don't know how
to evaluate that and so for those big
open-ended projects oh there's big
things that aren't really constrained
environments that's where we have a lot
of information that's invisible because
it's inside the students own head and
that makes it very difficult for humans
to operate on let alone computers if
they can't see you they can't operate on
it right and then the other issue is
that there's information that we as
humans can process there right now it's
difficult for agents to process so when
I'm working with um a student I can tell
based on the facial expression are they
bored are they tired are they really
excited are they really confused oh
they're really frustrated and those all
inform how I react to them if they're
frustrated I may be a little more
patient if they're excited I'm going to
maybe push a little bit further or
connect to some bigger topics right now
computers are starting to have a little
bit of ability to do that kind of facial
recognition but it's not quite there yet
it's not fast enough to equip a tutor
with and so the other challenge that
those systems are really going to face
is processing the full range of
information that we humans can process
so reading the student understanding
that I understand a little bit about
their background and the context in
which they're working so I think those
are the two main challenges that they'll
need to overcome okay
so thank you again to Jason for
peppering me with questions on my own
topic absolutely David anything for you
you know that and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
