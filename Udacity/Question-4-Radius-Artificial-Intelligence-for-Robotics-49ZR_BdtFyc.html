circular robotic motion and we gave you
some equations to help you along in your
simulations I want to give you those
formulas again and explain where some of
them came from so the first equation I
want to talk about is this one the
radius of curvature is equal to the
length of the vehicle
over the tangent of alpha where alpha is
our steering angle let me write that up
here so where does this equation come
from to derive it the key realization is
that the front and rear tire do not
travel along the same circle so here's
my rear tire and here's my front tire
they are of course separated by a
distance that we called L and let's draw
the circles that these tires travel
along well this rear tire is actually
going to travel along a smaller inner
circle while this tire is going to
travel along a larger outer circle and
since we define our radius of curvature
as the distance from the back tire to
this Center let's label this R and we
can see that the line connecting these
tires defines an axis and here we have
our steering angle alpha from here and
now we can do a little bit of geometry
let's make a right triangle well if this
angle here is alpha and this must be a
90-degree angle because of radius
intersecting with a tangent line always
forms a right angle that means that this
angle here must be equal to 90 degrees
minus alpha which means this angle since
this is a right triangle
must be alpha well we're almost there
the tangent of this angle is equal to
the opposite side which is the length
over the adjacent side which is the
radius so tangent of alpha is equal to L
over R we manipulate this equation a
little bit and we find that the radius
of curvature is equal to the length of
the vehicle over the tangent of the
steering angle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
