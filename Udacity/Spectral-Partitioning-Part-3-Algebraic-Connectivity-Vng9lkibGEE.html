laplacian its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors and graph partitioning but
first some handy facts I'll just state
these without proof if you need that
please see the paper by Python at all
posted in the instructors notes the
first key fact is that the laplacian is
symmetric this follows from its
definition an important consequence of
this fact is the second fact the
eigenvalues of the laplacian will be
real valued and non-negative I say real
valued as opposed to complex valued the
laplacian eigenvectors will also be real
valued and we can define them to be
orthogonal if you've forgotten what an
eigenvalue and an eigenvector are here's
a quick reminder eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are paired let's let lambda
I and Q sub I be an eigenvalue in an
eigenvector respectively of log10 the
following holds multiplying L of G by
its eigenvector gives you a scaled
version of the eigenvector the scaling
factor is the eigenvalue you can also
write this differently in matrix form L
of G times Q is equal to Q times lambda
Q and lambda are matrices in particular
the columns of Q are the eigenvectors of
L of G lambda is a diagonal matrix where
all the eigenvalues sit on the diagonal
and what about this orthogonal bit
orthogonality tells us that the dot
product between any pair of eigenvectors
will be 0 if they're different or one if
they're the same in more compact matrix
notation q transpose times Q is the
identity matrix now what about this non
negative eigenvalues bit that tells us
that all the eigenvalues are at least 0
now a common convention is to assume
that we can sort the eigenvalues so
let's do that - we'll let the
eigenvalues with the smaller indices be
the smaller eigenvalues so in this case
lambda 0 is the smallest eigenvalue and
lambda 1 is the second smallest now
here's a third fact which I find
especially interesting it says that the
graph G has K connected components if
and only if the K smallest eigen values
are identically 0 this is a fact due to
Fiedler and when I first learned this
fact I was like wow I mean OMG wow like
seriously as in SRS
why seriously it's a cool fact because
it says the graph laplacian spectrum
meaning its eigenvalues tells us
something about the underlying
connectivity of the graph here's one
more important fact let's say you have a
graph that's been partitioned into two
pieces one piece is the plus piece and
the other piece of the minus piece let's
let V Plus be the set of vertices and
the plus piece and V minus the set of
vertices in the minus piece now this is
all graph language what about the linear
algebra side let's define a vector X
with respect to this partition each
entry of X will correspond to a
particular vertex we'll assign that
entry a positive one if the vertex lies
in V plus and a minus one if the vertex
is in V minus now suppose you want to
count the number of edges that are being
cut in the graph this leads us to our
fourth fact the number of cut edges is
this product 1/4 X transpose L times X
this fact is also very nice it says that
if you want to minimize edge cuts
you should try minimizing this product
okay
so let's quickly summarize the four
facts take a moment to digest them once
you've done so you're ready for the
spectral partitioning algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
