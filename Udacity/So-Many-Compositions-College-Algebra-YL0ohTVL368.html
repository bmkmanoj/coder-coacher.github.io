see what happens how about one of these
more difficult ones let's say g of g
inverse of X G of X is one-fourth times
the quantity X minus 9 so in place of X
we need to plug in the function G
inverse which is 4x plus 9 so we look at
one-fourth times 4x plus 9-9 what does
this simplify to inside the parentheses
we just end up with 4x and one-fourth
times 4x is equal to X hmm I'm going to
go through and find all these other
compositions right now let's see what
happens and it looks like each of these
composite functions is in fact just
equal to X this confirms another
fascinating property of inverse
functions the composition of a function
with its inverse and vice versa we'll
both give us what is known as the
identity function it's just the
independent variable which in this case
is X so another way to think about
inverse functions is that the function f
inverse will undo whatever the function
f has done to the independent variable
in this case f is adding 1 and f inverse
is subtracting one here g is subtracting
9 and then dividing by 4 ng inverse is
multiplying by 4 and then adding 9
lastly age cubes and h inverse takes the
cube root i think we're really getting
down to what it fundamentally means for
functions to be inverses one another
that's really awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
