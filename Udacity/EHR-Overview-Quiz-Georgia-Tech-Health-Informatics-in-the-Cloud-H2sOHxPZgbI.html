other two components of hi-tech are
meaningful use and incentive payments
before we discuss them we'll have a
basic overview of electronic medical
records physicians are in the data
business they collect data they make
treatment decisions based on that data
and they follow patients through other
data and make adjustments as needed the
data physicians record can be divided
into subjective information generally
information collected from the patient
such as the chief complaint the reason
they visited the physician today their
medical history and the history of the
particular problem that brought them to
the doctor physicians may collect
objective data by doing a physical exam
ordering x-rays or other images or doing
lab tests the resulting data can be in
many forms it can be free text it can be
structured codes such as the ICD we
referred to earlier could be continuous
wave forms from an electrocardiogram
images sound recordings or even videos
increasingly data from chronic disease
and other patients may be coming from
their smartphone or from physiologic
measurement devices they used to track
their own health at home storing and
presenting this rich data set is an EMR
design challenge yet many EMR still
minute the organization of the paper
chart even simulating the tabs that
divide the sections where the data types
are stored despite its key role in
medicine physicians have historically
focused far more on collecting the right
data then they have on recording it
completely accurately and legibly as
we've seen in a fragmented system of
care where many physicians treat aspects
of a single patient's care this can lead
to duplicate testing or even errors
here's a particularly dramatic example
for which medication was this
prescription written was it hi sir dill
