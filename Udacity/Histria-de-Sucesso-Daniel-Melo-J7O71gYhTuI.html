entrepreneur in the technology field
I study advertising but I ended up as
doing a lot of websites I started my
company I got less and less close to
coding and stuff I was more in the
management I felt that I needed to go
back and you know like learn everything
again and learn more in outdoor why I
knew a lot of stuff I did a lot of stuff
the wrong way because there are so many
easier ways to do and you learn that in
audacity so even if you already
experienced you're going to be learning
the best way you know like in different
ways and it's pretty cool Udacity is
revolutionized education you're not just
learning from the videos and trying to
do but then you send your cold and they
review it and that's what I like the
most you know I live in Brazil so I
wouldn't be able to come here to have
this kind of classes with the teachers
that we have with programmers that work
in Google or any company that partners
with the audacity by the other side as a
business owner it's good because so hard
to hire qualified people for a
technology business Udacity courses are
a folks at home market so that's the the
best part you know you qualify people to
get into the company and you qualify
students to get their dream job or to
devil on an app to start a company you
know that's pretty awesome if you can
change the world of technology even if
it's a corporate thing like you're
changing the management of the company
you're making their lives easier you
know there are a lot of things that you
can do with technology the possibilities
are infinite you know you could do
anything I'm not a computer science
graduate so sometimes I would stop and
think that's not for me you stop and you
say like oh this is too hard cuz it
doesn't worth it and stuff don't give up
because sometimes it's not easy
sometimes you will find a code that is
hard a language that is hard but if
someone did it before you you
and do it too so that that's the only
advice that I will
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
