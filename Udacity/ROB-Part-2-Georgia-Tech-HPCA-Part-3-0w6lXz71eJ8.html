is supposed to look like let's see how
it's used for that we need the reorder
buffer with its commits and issue points
and we need the rest of the processor
that we have already seen the
instruction queue reservation stations
registers and the rat let's say that we
have this add instruction here in the
instruction queue so now we want to see
what happens once we start issuing this
all the way to once we eventually commit
this instruction in a processor that now
has a reorder buffer
so let's first see what happens on
instruction issue as before when we
didn't have the reorder buffer we get a
free reservation station and we put our
instruction in it now that we do have a
reorder buffer we will also get one of
those unlike reservation station where
we just need a free one it doesn't
matter which one it is
here we need to get the entry that is
the next one at the issue point so our
instruction will go here in the reorder
buffer that of course also means that
our issue point will now move and points
to the next entry in the reorder buffer
so now we have seven instructions that
have been issued and have not yet
committed another thing that we had to
do when we were issuing instructions in
tomasulo's algorithm is that the rat
entry for r1 the destination register of
the instruction needed to be pointed to
the reservation station for the
instruction we will still need to do
this pointing but instead of the
reservation station now we point the rat
entry to the Rob entry for the
instruction that means that this rat
entry will be now instead of pointing to
the reservation station B pointing to
this entry here so overall at the end of
the cycle when we issue this instruction
we will occupy a reservation station
with the values that we found for these
registers we will make the rat point to
the Rob six entry and in this entry we
will say that r1 will need to be written
for this instruction and we don't still
have the value
so the downbeat is zero here for this
instruction now this ad here might wait
for operands to become ready
and that happens exactly as before with
tomasulo's algorithm we just capture
results that we need and we are ready to
dispatch once we have all the operands
eventually the ad has all the things
that it needs to dispatch and the
dispatching works exactly the same as
before so we check whether the operands
are ready and when they are we send the
instruction for execution but now we can
also free the reservation station as
soon as we dispatch previously with
tomasulo's algorithm we need it to wait
for the reservation station release all
the way until this instruction
broadcasts its result that was needed
because the reservation station serves
as the name for the result now that the
name for the result is the Rob entry we
no longer need the reservation stations
to play that role so the reservation
station now does only its primary job
which is wait for operands and capture
them and then figure out which
instructions to dispatch after that the
reservation station for the instruction
is done so we can freed so now our ad
executes and carries with it the tag of
Rob 6 which is the name for its result
eventually it produces a result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
