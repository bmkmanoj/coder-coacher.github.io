helpful for this project is it's using
the developer tools provided to you by
chrome and in particular the JavaScript
console will be really really useful and
giving you information on what still
isn't being defined or what you still
need to call and make sure to make use
of the console dot log function so i've
loaded things on my localhost I've there
you go see I have two errors already all
anything this is not defined and then
you know player is not defined so
basically I have this error here I'm
like okay well we're how do I go and
look into this err well you know Google
tools are some awesome tool sets for you
and you just like really expand this
error it's gonna tell you exact in your
stack basically I'm Mexican so basically
I am I am going in best thing is on the
right side yeah it tells you the finding
the foundation line by line numbers yes
exactly and essentially you can go to
that line number go to the first error
um also the files come with a lot of
comments that explain what you need to
do yeah what your code should look like
exactly oh and that that's a good start
give it give it give it a try I really
recommend I mean personally I don't like
to go look for an answer before I try it
yeah try it just not just be a bit like
a detective or be beat here's a picture
like you could be a detective or it
could be like a daredevil like you're
the coding der w just dive in straight
in try to break things try to shake
things up be a tu know it exactly yeah
that's what I do yeah oh yeah the
three-year-old right ya see can we not
talk about yes oh I mean like yeah be me
that daring person and try to explore
and purposely break things so I'm I'm
exploring on breaking things right now
i'm gonna click on engine is on line
number 94 so the engine will say okay
I'm going to function of the entities
and says all enemies for each enemy
exactly and then it says
like reference this animation not be
fine I'm not defining mouth all henna
means go ahead define on anything yeah
let's just go to find all enemies and
then go through the code if you look for
the code a little more you will find
that all enemies will be in Apache fjs
here now you go there you go see here's
the instructions now instantiate your
objects place all enemy objects in an
array called all enemies there you go
now why don't I just create something in
my code that says you know far all
enemies tickles that CA see what happens
see what happens now Kenny we can i save
this nah no I'll think I could save this
way if you if you run to this you'll get
some more ears and then you didn't need
to find out okay what's the next step
like something that wasn't except air oh
I need to I'll give you a hand oh I
actually have nothing in all enemies
because I supposed to have some sort of
like you what enemy I think new enemy
maybe new enemy now I associate it I
actually in your old Janice course I
create a new object by putting new so
okay say that and see what else breaks
now I'll handle these errors one step at
a time and just pick up airs as like
breadcrumbs they are clues to what you
need to do absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
