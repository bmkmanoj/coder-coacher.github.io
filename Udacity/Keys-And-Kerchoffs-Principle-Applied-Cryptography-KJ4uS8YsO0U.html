later before I go on I want to mention
one very important principle in
cryptography which is known as
kirchoff's principle and it goes back to
a book that kirchoff's wrote back in
1883 and the way Kirchhoff's cent stated
it was this this was in a book he wrote
in 1883 about military cryptography
focal Nexis paula secret a cube with
songs unconvenient tombe entree lame and
enemy and I apologize for my french but
this loosely translates as the cipher
must not depend on secrecy of the
mechanism it must not matter if it falls
into the hands of the enemy so the
reason for that and it's important what
he's focusing on is the mechanism here
so if you think about these two
functions we need we need encryption and
decryption coming up with new functions
or new mechanisms in kirchoff's day
these were mostly mechanical devices
that you needed as part of the
encryption process well that's a lot of
work you don't want to have to keep
inventing new encryption and decryption
functions and deciding they're secure
and distributing them what you want is
some way that even if your encryption
and decryption functions are known your
cipher can still be secure and the way
they achieve that is to use a key so
instead of just having the message as
input to the encryption function the
other input to the encryption function
is a key and if it's a symmetric
cryptosystem that same key is the key
that is needed in the decryption
function as well if the security relies
only on keeping the key secret well then
we can make our encryption and
decryption functions public we can
analyze them we can put a lot of work
into developing good encryption and
decryption functions and then the
security depends only on keeping the key
secret if we think our key has been
exposed well then we just need to come
up with a new key but we can keep using
the same functions if the function turns
out to have a weakness in it well that's
a much more serious problem then we need
to develop a new encryption function and
argue that that new function is secure
so this quiz is the check that you
understand kirchoff's principle and
understand the terms that we've defined
so the question is which parts of a krip
system must be kept secret the choices
are Alice the algorithm used for
encryption the algorithm used for
decryption the keys and the ciphertext
check all the parts that must be kept
secret</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
