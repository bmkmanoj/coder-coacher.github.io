transported you randomly to another
start State
and you claim that you understand how
things work now so can you explain okay
I think I do so the goal is to go get
the little yellow circle or the circle
which was yellow to begin with the last
time I don't know if that means anything
and I think it was Green last was it and
you want to pick it up which was I think
five and when you do that what I don't
yet know is whether it will change color
but whatever color it is when you pick
it up you want to take it to the square
that matches that color and then put it
down which is action one now I should
say because I didn't say it before that
what I thought the point was the first
time was just to get the square and the
circle in the same place the square and
the circle yeah you did that right and
then but the but you didn't get any
reward for that right so then I figured
out maybe I didn't do anything but at
that time I was also trying to figure
out what all the commands did good
I was doing a lot of exploring alright
so you learned a bit about the
transition function you learned a little
bit of about how actions change the
state mm-hmm and and you also learned a
little bit about what states are
rewarding yes and so now you think even
though things are a bit different you
think you can actually get kind of on a
minimal path to a goal state now I'm
sure so from here I would go three three
then I would go for four then five which
keeps it yellow so then I need to go as
quickly to yellow as I can there's a lot
of ways of doing that but let's just do
two two six six six six to two and then
that doesn't work hmm is it possible you
forgot something oh one I gotta put it
down boom done
all right so good excellent job all
right so so yeah so that was an MVP in
fact you solved that a lot faster than
any of the algorithms that we're gonna
be talking about because you made use of
all kinds of interesting background
information about how you can you know
what navigation does and how it's
consistent across States but generally
in the MDP model in the reinforcement
learning model we don't necessarily
that it could very well be that what
you're you know in each state the
actions all do some other kind of crazy
different thing and you have to learn
that mapping right so let me say two
things actually three things one is what
I was trying to figure out what the
actions were I considered for a moment
even though I'd already figured out that
three moves you right
I considered trying to go right a couple
of times just to see if there was any
randomness or stochasticity
but then I decided you wouldn't do that
to me you're too nice of a person and so
I decided they were terminus to can
didn't do that but you point out that
yeah I did it kind of fast because I had
a lot of background knowledge I'd really
say that it was more about assumptions
okay and in fact my first assumption was
wrong oh right that the goal was just to
get in the same place as a circle and
that was the whole point
that's true and then the last thing I'll
say is that as long as I've been
thinking about reinforcement learning as
long as I've been thinking about search
algorithms and AI and as long as I've
been doing machine learning I don't
think I ever really appreciate it just
are incredibly frustrating it is when
you don't actually know what the rules
are and you're just trying to figure out
if you're just trying to figure out
what's going on and I now I'm gonna be
much kinder to all of my search
algorithms that's that's what I was
hoping you get out of that thank you
yeah so so you know sometimes it's
really frustrating watching these
algorithms do what they do and you know
in some cases just repeatedly bashing
their heads against the wall which for
what it's worth is something that you
didn't do when you were moving around in
the grid you were purposely avoiding
these dark black lines do you know why
like maybe those are actually reward
lines if you bump into them you win yeah
but every time I've ever played any game
their walls yeah they look like walls
and in fact they are in this case so so
do that again that was that was an
assumption that you brought to bear but
but but right so when you watch a
learning algorithm a reinforcement
learning algorithm actually interacting
with a grid like this it doesn't have
those biases necessarily and so it can
actually bash its head against this wall
and then maybe this wall for awhile and
hey this wall looks really fun and so
yeah it's good that we have a little bit
of I don't know empathy for the the poor
reinforcement learning agent that's
trying to master this environment given
very complex and
and hard to parse apart representations
for the actions in the States
hmm it's very good probably the only
thing more frustrating than my trying to
play this well as all the people
watching me trying to play this oh I
think they loved it for what it's worth
we can make this available if people
would play it on their home computers
yeah but now they know the answer can
you just like randomly change what the
actions are let's say that I did that
okay that was actually quite good I'm
glad you didn't let me know what it was
before you do you recognize it now
though recognize what now yes it's a
taxi it's a taxi cab to me
I almost said that and then realized
that would break the illusion so when I
had Molly do this a long time ago and I
asked her at the end like what is
exactly the task that this is supposed
to be doing she's like well you have to
rescue the dog and it just wants to go
to its house Wow
that is I thought that was kind of
Awesome we should try there with my
daughter and see if soon as she could
sit still long enough and see what she
would come up with the other thing is
when you when you had it in this
position and you really liked the kind
of the symmetries of it and stuff we
actually did this in a mall in New
Jersey where we had people come by and
and you know just see what they would do
we would give them the game and they did
and there was one woman who's a real
estate agent who just could not get over
the idea that the actual goal is to fix
the feng shui
so there's if you look there's a color
in every corner except the blue is not
quite in a corner so she kept trying to
move the blue into the corner and when I
told her that she should stop doing that
she just kept doing it because she was
convinced that the task was one of Feng
Shui I like that yeah and that tells you
everything you need to know about why
our real estate market is the way it is
a New Jersey mm-hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
