question by saying that the word outlet
reminded them of the outlet in the wall
now this as you know is a connection
between electrical appliances at home
and the electric grid in much the same
way an outlet in iOS is also a
connection it's a connection between our
code and something on the storyboard
let's see how this works in code so to
manage screen space I will slide out the
utility area and then go on to the
assistant editor there then I will hold
down control on my keyboard click on
this label and then drag to the top of
this class and let go here I have a
pop-up that I can fill in the type of
this connection is an outlet I will call
it recording in progress the type of
this label in iOS is called UI label ui
stands for user interface and then I
will hit connect okay so I have some
code here that Xcode has written for me
let's unpack this line so we created a
variable called recording in progress
the type of this variable is UI label
here we also see something called IB
outlet I B stands for interface builder
and IB outlet tells developers like us
that hey this variable is not an
ordinary variable but is linked to the
storyboard or the interface builder
somehow another thing to notice here is
this keyword week what you should know
about this for now is that this keyword
allows us to manage memory for our
variables and week as opposed to what
strong that's right
strong is also a keyword in iOS both
weak and strong helped us manage memory
for our variables the keyword strong
means hey I initialize that variable so
keep it around till I don't need it
anymore weak on the other hand means
someone else created that variable
someone else and all I want to do is
have a weak reference to that variable
now if you want to learn more about
these two keywords weak and strong we
found a great Stack Overflow page that
explains these two really well the link
to that page is in the instructor notes
so if I return to my
odhh I can see that we also have a bang
or an exclamation point here at the end
is this our way of demonstrating
excitement for declaring this variable
not quite the real answer lies around an
idea in Swift called optionals Swift
allows us to declare a variable like
we've done here and it also allows us to
not declare any value for this variable
in our code or have its value be
optional there is a document in the
instructor notes
that explains optionals and these
exclamation points in detail I encourage
you to bookmark it for now and read it
later okay now that I have an outlet to
this label in our code I can go back to
this function remember this is the
action that gets called when we press
the microphone button and change the
visibility of our label so I can say
recording in progress and there is an
autocomplete I can say it is no longer
hidden there so what I'm saying here is
that when this microphone button gets
pressed this record audio function gets
called and at that point I do not want
this label to be hidden anymore all
right let me run this code and see what
happens all right so I don't see the
label when the app first launches which
is good and when I press the microphone
button the label starts to show that's
great so I'm going to go back to my code
slide out my debug area and then remove
this one to do because we've already
done it now done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
