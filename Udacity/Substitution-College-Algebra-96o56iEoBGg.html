come up with so far one equation for the
amount of money that grant has left
after a given amount of time and another
equation for the total amount of money
he's spent depending on how many months
have passed since he's been in business
one thing that we can notice about these
two equations is that money spent is
involved in both of them now remember
that what an equations means is that
whatever appears on one side of it is
exactly equal to what appears on the
other side so since we know something
about what money spent is equal to any
way we see money spent in any equation
in the system we can replace it with
what we know it's equal to which is this
the number of money spent each month
times the number of months so taking
this idea of substituting in values for
other things that we know that they're
equal to which answer down here would
give us another way of writing out how
much money we know that grant has left I
know that this is a lot of writing to
have on the screen at one time so not a
problem at all if this looks confusing
just give the quiz a try and we'll see
what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
