we need to designate which views are
shared we do this by setting the same
transition name attribute on the views
in both activities I tend to use a
string resource to make sure they match
exactly next when we launch the activity
we need to use a variant of the activity
options make scene transition animation
API that lets us specify the shared
elements we pass this API the view and
the transition name so it can look for
its counterpart in the launch activity
there are variants of this API for
specifying a single shared element like
this or ways to specify many shared
elements if you want multiple things to
transition note that interestingly the
transition name field is a string rather
than perhaps identifying a view by ID
this is because shared element
transitions don't just work between
screens within your own app you can
publish the transition names you support
and have shared element transitions
between different applications pretty
rad so that's enough to create a shared
element transition not too much effort
for quite an impressive effect you may
be wondering how the system knew to
animate the size and position in our
example well by default shared element
transitions use a built-in transition
called move this is what it looks like
the change bounds transition there's a
lot of the heavy lifting and moves and
resizes elements between states
the remaining transitions help with
images to change the transformation and
clip apply to them if you want to
customize the animations used then we
can create our own transitions and set
them in a similar way to the activity
content transitions here's how you'd set
a custom transition via XML and via code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
