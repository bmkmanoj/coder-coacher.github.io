the collage on the screen shows several
knowledge representations that air has
developed in each knowledge
representation there is a language that
language has a vocabulary then in
addition to that language in that
knowledge representation is some content
the content is some knowledge let's take
an example with which you probably
already familiar consider the Newton's
second law of motion so I can represent
it as F is equal to Ma this is a
knowledge representation a very simple
knowledge representation in which there
are two things there is a language of
algebraic equations Y is equal to B X
for example and there is then there is
the content of our knowledge of Newton's
second law of motion force equals mass
times acceleration so the knowledge
representation has two things once again
the language which has its vocabulary
for example the sign of equality and the
content that goes into that
representation expressed in that
language
let us not vary too much about all the
representations on this collage right
now we'll get to them later
the idea here is to simply show that air
has to add up not one but many knowledge
representations each representation has
its own affordances and its own
constraints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
