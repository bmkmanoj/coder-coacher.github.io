of big fast modern routers here's a
picture of to modern router chassis x'
on the Left we have a picture of the
Cisco CRS one and on the right we have a
picture of the juniper m320 the m320 has
for some time been used at the border of
the Georgia Tech Network between Georgia
Tech and the rest of the internet here's
a picture of a couple of line cards that
go into these chassis x' these kind of
look like network interface cards except
the ports are special instead of
terminating Ethernet these ports
terminate high-capacity fiber links as
you can see these cards are actually a
whole lot bigger than your typical
network interface card as well and as a
result these chassis x' are often
anywhere from three to six feet tall and
can fill up an entire rack there's a
significant need for big fast routers
links are getting faster traffic demands
are also increasing particularly with
the rise of demanding applications such
as streaming video networks are getting
bigger too in terms of the number of
hosts routers and users so there's a
perennial need to design big vast
routers particularly in Internet
backbone networks the rest of this
lesson will focus on how a router works
in particular how it goes from the
process of taking a packet as input and
sending it on to where it needs to go
the Internet's routing protocols of
course are responsible for populating
the forwarding tables on a router but
once those tables are populated the
router still has the hard job of taking
a packet as input and ultimately getting
it to the appropriate output port so
that the traffic can proceed and route
to the destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
