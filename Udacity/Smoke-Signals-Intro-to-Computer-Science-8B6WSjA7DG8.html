thanks Andy for the grease drawing so
what does it take to make a network like
this work so let's suppose we wanted to
send a message from roads to Sparta and
we have many points along the way where
we can send smoke signals so we'd start
by sending a smoke signal from roads
this will be visible from a few other
points and to reach Sparta the one at
nachos would need to resend it we need
to also submit a smoke signal that would
be visible at some other points the one
at melos would need to see it and resend
it and maybe that's already visible at
Sparta so we need several different
things in order to make a network like
this work the first thing we need is a
way to encode messages we need to be
able to convert the message that we want
to send say it's a message that says the
Trojans are arriving we needed to be
able to send that message and encode
that in a smoke signal we need a way to
do browsing we need to figure out where
the message should go if we want to send
it to Sparta we need to know that it
should be forwarded by these nodes the
node that sees it from millet us does
not need to resend it probably the way
the ancient Greek network worked all the
nodes resent every message they didn't
have a way to do writing selectively but
that's very wasteful what we'd like is a
way to only send the message to the
destination goes to for the kinds of
messages the ancient Greeks were sending
that says things like the enemies
arriving well it was okay you wanted to
send it everywhere that's called
flooding the network but if we want to
send messages just between two points
we've got to know which nodes should
resend the message or which direction to
send it in and the final thing we need
to worry about is we need to decide who
gets to use the network so it might be
that there more than one enemy arriving
at once or maybe the enemies arriving it
might be at the same time Achilles say
Achilles as in millet asst and he wants
to send a message back to media in
Delphi so maybe Achilles wants to send a
message that would go like this at the
same time as the army needing to send
this important
message that saying the Trojans are
arriving so we need to figure out who
gets to use the network and what they
get to send so these are all things the
ancient Greek network would have had to
deal with if it was sophisticated enough
to worry about them if it was just
sending the message that says the troops
are arriving well that's one smoke
signal and it didn't necessarily need
that all of these are the same things
that we need to worry about if we want
to send messages on the Internet so
these are the things that we need to
make any network we need some way to
take the messages that we want to send
and it code them in a way that they can
be transmitted and interpret them when
they get to the other end for the Greeks
the message was something like Agamemnon
is arising get the ships to a safe place
and they needed encode that in a smoke
signal we need a way to route messages
we need a way for the receiver of the
smoke signal to know the next place to
send it and for the ancient Greek
network since smoke signals are not
directional they just go up in there
there wasn't much to do here everyone
could see the message and they wanted to
send the message everywhere if we want
to send messages just between two points
this becomes a much tougher problem we
need rules for deciding who gets to use
resources if there are two messages that
want to go through the same place well
only one of those can be sent at a time
we need some way to decide one for the
Greeks well I don't know what the rules
were but let's assume their rule was if
your general your message has priority
we're going to did all these same things
for the internet before we talked about
how they're done on the Internet I want
to introduce the two main ways that we
measure networks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
