see the bug and our error call we're
sending in the error message but we're
not sending in the title and the art
that we got from users so let's go ahead
and fix that title arts and we don't
need to actually specify the keyword
parameters we can just pass them in
directly title art error so we've done
that we save the file and let's try this
again let's type in a title and we click
Submit perfect our text box stayed the
same we replace that text with nothing
enter in some fake artwork we still see
our error message and our text is
preserved
now one thing I'd like to show you
remember we spent all that time escaping
in our previous lecture let's type in
some text here okay I'm gonna submit
this huh it rendered it nicely it didn't
we didn't we didn't have any escaping
issues why is that you know we haven't
dealt with escaping in this file at all
let me show you how that works real
quick in the way I'm using Jinja is that
it's the template language we're using
by the way that's what's rendering this
HTML one of the parameters it takes when
you set up it's a little environment is
auto escape and I've set auto escape
equals true which will auto escape
anything we include from a variable
which is really convenient so you don't
have to think about escaping content
that comes from users if you use auto
escape and I always always use auto
escape if you want to deliberately
include something not escaped then you
can there's a method for doing that in
your template so it forces you to
acknowledge that issue whenever you want
to be unsafe and in the default case
you're just safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
