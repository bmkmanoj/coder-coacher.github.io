one-tailed tests if our sample mean lies
out here in the critical region
significantly higher than the current
population mean then we're guessing that
the population parameter after the
intervention will be greater than the
current similarly if our sample mean
lies in the critical region below the
current population parameter the
population parameter with the
intervention will have a lower score
than it does currently and finally if
our sample mean lies in the critical
region either higher or lower than the
current population parameter then we
conclude that the new population will be
significantly different we choose a
one-tailed or directional hypothesis
test when we predict a direction of the
treatment effect for example when we
predict that a song illustrating the
concepts in this lesson will increase or
decrease engagement alternatively we
would choose a two-tailed or non
directional hypothesis test when we do
not predict a direction of the treatment
effect in general we use two-tailed
tests because they are more conservative
we are less likely to reject the null
when it's true we'll get more into that
later but also because as you saw before
we might be wrong about the direction we
might predict that the treatment is
going to increase engagement when in
fact it decreases engagement in which
case we should have a two-tailed test if
we just used a one tailed test in the
positive direction we may miss the fact
that the treatment is doing the opposite
of what we would expect one exception to
this general rule is when we're
comparing a new treatment with an
established treatment in such cases we
often only care if the new treatment is
better than the old one we don't care if
the new one is much worse so that's when
we would use a one tailed directional
test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
