of the things that you've said in the
last couple of slides so I've brought
back the options that we had before and
the little pictures and I erased a bunch
of stuff and then I made a change do you
see the change ah you got rid of the
word oh yes I was going to see you got
rid of the word options but you actually
changed the word state into goal well
that wasn't what it used to say in the
title didn't say state abstraction
although I did write state abstraction
at some point oh it had temporal
abstraction that's right so what I want
to point out you asked a question when
before we did the quiz you said well
wait are these things all happening at
the same time or are they happening like
one of how does this work well you
touched on something kind of neat there
right which is we have talked about so
far the this kind of options thing as if
well is if they're just primitive
actions right you take one then you take
the other you take the other in other
words we've talked about sequencing and
that's perfectly reasonable and that's
really what we've been talking about and
everything that we've talked about in
this class but when you ask whether the
things could be running to at the same
time or whether we're trying to
accomplish all these at once we're
really talking about something different
which is goals so I'm going to claim
that although we've been focusing on
sequencing which makes sense right we're
talking about sequential decision
processes right that's like the whole
point of what we're doing you could
think about these things as running in
parallel although we talk about well
first I'm going to take the the option
of go to the east door and then I'm
going to execute the option go to the
south door and then I'm going to go down
down left or whatever i'm going to do
you could conceptualize this as actually
all the options are running at the same
time so i am always trying to go to the
east door the south door the other south
door the other east door and at any
given time one of them is in control I
mean conceptually that's no different
really right ah so maybe I mean I guess
it sounds like what you're describing is
a little bit like a like a call stack on
in in computer languages the idea that
sure while we're going after that first
goal of getting to the east door in the
Northeast room you know in the back of
our minds is the idea that what were the
reason we're doing that is so that we
can do these other
goals next no I don't actually mean
something a little bit different so
imagine I had a bunch of things running
in parallel because imagine we had a
thing called a computer right and the
computer did many things at once so it
was recording it was printing it was
letting some program compile in the
background while the user was editing
from the computers point of view right
the way we think about these things
these things are all sort of running at
the same time but at least four from
with respect to any individual processor
only one thing can be happening at the
same time so we can write down
everything as if it's happening in
sequence but in some sense it's
happening in parallel or they're all
fighting for resources at the same time
but only one of them can be in control
at any given point in time so even
though the world is sequential we think
about executing an option than executing
another option a kind of it's a
reasonably of thinking about the world
but there's another kind of conceit one
could take which is all of these things
want to run they all want to happen at
the same time they're constantly saying
take me take me take me I want to have
control of the mouse or I want to
control the screen or whatever and we're
just choosing which one to let go so
they're still running at the same time
they're just not in control at the same
time and aren't able to do anything once
you do that you end up thinking or you
can end up thinking about of this
problem of temporal abstraction is not
one of sequencing things directly but as
one of managing competing goals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
