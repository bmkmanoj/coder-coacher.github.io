database is in a particular relational
database that we been looking at well
now we want to sort of go back to what
is relevant to securing it what are the
things that we have talked about
remember we are going to have users who
want to access the database we would
have to do authentication so we know who
the request is coming from and once you
do authentication then comes access
control so let's talk about how access
control is done in databases so actually
there are two basic commands and
different variations of SQL details may
differ but we're basically talking about
the key concepts so you can grant or
revoke so this is sort of an example of
how access could be granted so this says
grant either set of privileges so for
example selecting some tuples so
privileged maybe to do a select for
example so you can grant a privilege on
a table or you can grant a role to a
certain user that could be in the
context of a given table but that's the
resource we are talking about this is
what you can do with the resource this
access has been granted to a certain
user it could be granted to a role we
talked about all based access control so
if you have that it could be granted to
role or public is is grounded to
everyone so this is the world every user
that we have in the system so some of
these things are optional for example
watch and this parentheses here so if
you don't specify a table that basically
saying on all tables okay so you can
either specify a particular table or if
you don't then it sits this is an
optional part here if it's omitted then
that would mean all the tables similarly
there's an optional thing here that says
identified by password so that means if
you want to ever revoke this this axis
that's being you know granted as a
result of this you will need the
password to do that so somebody else
can't revoke it if they don't have the
password and another thing that you can
do here which is also optional is that
whoever you granting this access to the
user or to the role they can actually
further
propagate so that's the grant option
saying well I give you access you can
give this access to somebody else if
this is specified if you have the access
with with the grant option so an example
of this would be for example a statement
that says you grant the Select privilege
okay on any table so we are omitting
this choosing a particular table because
this is optional to the user part here
is Alice remember we didn't include
there aren't option here that means
Alice will not be able to further
propagate this select access that she
has on any table to somebody else when
you talk about securing data of course
you know you have to worry about access
control okay so access control make good
things happen of course authorized users
need to have access so this is how you
can grant access to them we talked about
both a mandatory access control and
discretionary access control if your
company controls centrally who should
have access to what kind of things they
should be able to do with various
databases and tables in the databases
they have then of course it'll be
centrally managed access so that would
be mandatory access control
discretionary means you know if you
created a table then of course you are
the owner and you can decide who else
can access it but this is how access is
granted so we saw the example of a
privilege but privileges can also be
operation such as you can insert update
delete tuples and insert new tuples and
things like that all the different
things we said we can do on databases
these are the operations you can perform
and basically access control says a
certain user role is allowed to perform
that operation not so the other side is
you know you decide if grant is of
course you may want to revoke so
revoking is again privileged we are
talking about the example we had was
select but it could be you know one of
the other ones or you being able to take
on a certain role optionally on a table
and you take it from a user or a role or
from everybody granting is giving
someone access revoking is take
that axis back and an example would be
no revoke the Select privilege on any
table so we omit this from user Alice
granting access rights to perform
various operations they can do on it on
a table and revoking those this is how
we manage access control in databases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
