broadcasting that query to every other
node on the network that query will be
of a form who has a particular IP
address such as 130 dot 207 dot one
sixty dot forty-seven and the particular
host who has that IP address on the LAN
will respond with the appropriate MAC
address so the ARP query is a broadcast
that goes to every host on the LAN from
the host that wants the answer to the
query and the response is a unicast
response with the MAC address as the
answer that's returned to the host that
issued the query when the host that
issues the query receives a reply it
starts to build what's called an ARP
table its ARP table then Maps each IP
address on the local area network to the
corresponding MAC address now instead of
broadcasting an ARP query to discover
the MAC address corresponding with this
IP address the host can simply consult
its local ARP table let's now take a
look at what the host does with this
information when the host wants to send
a packet to the destination with a
particular IP address it takes that IP
packet and encapsulate sit in an
Ethernet frame with the corresponding
destination MAC address essentially it
puts that IP packet inside of an
Ethernet frame so before it sends the IP
packet with that destination IP address
it first puts the packet inside a larger
Ethernet frame with its own source MAC
address and the destination MAC address
from its local ARP table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
