rules down let's talk specifically about
validation rules validation rules are
primarily used for enforcing the
structure of your data and the format of
your content take a look over here this
is the start of a validation rule for
new value being written in the list name
field and in plain English what it's
saying is that the value that's written
here must be a string and it's placement
where it's nested inside user list of
these two wild-card variables and the
property name list name makes it
specifically a rule that affects the
list name values so let's take an actual
look at the variables and methods that
are used within this expression itself
first i'd like to point out this
variable called new data when you're
writing your validation rules you're
almost always going to need a way to
refer to the value that is either
currently there or that their users try
to write to that location because of
this the firebase rules language
provides to predefined variables
specifically for these values and they
are data and new data you can use these
anywhere within your rules now data
refers to the data as it currently is
and new data refers to the data after a
right has taken place in the rules
language these have the variable types
of rule data snapshots and they're
called data snapshots because they can
either be a single value or a whole
portion of data in the firebase database
so just to be explicit if I had a
shopping list with something like Lila's
list and then I went to edit it Laila's
list would be the current value which
would be stored in data awesome list
Laila's awesome list would be the value
that be stored in new data now as i
stated both data and new data are what's
known as rule data snapshots and ruled
out of snapshots have a bunch of methods
that you can use in the rules i'll go
ahead and link to the api docs where you
could read to your heart's content about
all of these methods but here are a
couple of interest because these are
data snapshots which know their location
in the tree you can use the parent or
child method to navigate to other nodes
in the tree this lets you do cool things
like create rules that compare one of
the database to another part of the
database for example if you wanted to
access the owner value from your list
name rule you could write new data dot
parent which would take you from list
name up to
parent here then dot child owner which
would take you down to the owner then
finally vow which is a method that lets
you get the current value at that
variable and for the user Lila fish at
this specific node this rule would
return this value here and then you
could use it in something like a
comparison in this case this is a kind
of silly validate rule that doesn't make
much sense it's saying that the new data
that you're writing for the list name
must be the same as the owner's email so
you'd have a bunch of list names named
after owners but hopefully that gives a
little bit more insight about how you
may be able to use the parent or child
methods note that the ability to use
parent in the rules is somewhat
different that the data snapshots that
we've been using in our Android app when
you get a data snapshot on the client
side you can't see anything that is the
parent of the location that you
requested in the rules though you can
look at any other part of the database
in order to make a rule which is why you
can use a method like pairing now as I
mentioned you can use the value method
and that will give you a primitive value
back from a data or new data object in
addition you have methods that check for
the type at a current location and exist
is actually a really helpful method to
use when you're writing rules that are
specific to whether a value is being
added or removed and with that we can
see that this is string method here is
one of the type methods which is making
sure that the value stored in new data
is a string let's see an example of a
little bit of a more complicated rule
here so here we've added another little
bit to this rule and basically what this
says is that new data is both a string
and that this new list name has at least
one character in it from this example
you can see that Java scripts logical
and comparison operators are available
to you in addition when you're dealing
with values that are strings there's a
subset of JavaScript string methods and
properties which are available to you
new data value length is one such
example the length value is available
team and another hopeful one is the
matches method which allows you to match
a string against a regular expression
for example if you wanted to validate
data at a location to see if it's in the
form of an email address you can
standard email address read X and then
use matches to do
the actual comparison so that's pretty
much the summary of writing a single
validation rule in addition there are a
few other things that you might want to
keep in mind the first is that whenever
you write server side validation rules
you should also be writing the
corresponding client-side validation
rules for example in the dialog where
somebody changes a shopping lists list
name you should go ahead and check that
that list name is actually greater than
0 characters there's no sense wasting
one of your users data plans by pinging
the database with improperly formatted
data so go ahead and save them and
yourself that useless network traffic
second remember that validation rules
are only checked when you're actually
writing data this might be pretty
straightforward but they're not checked
when you read data and finally
validation rules are not checked when
you're deleting data otherwise you'd
basically never be able to remove
anything from the database for example
if I try to set a list name here to know
and it was checking validation rules
then it would complain that null is
neither a string nor has a length
greater than zero but it doesn't do
those checks and instead you don't have
any validation checks when you're
deleting something okay so now that you
know how to write a single rule let's
talk about validating an entire
structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
