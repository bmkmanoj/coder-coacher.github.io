scheduling policies we have to talk
about performance now the figures of
Merit that is associated with the
scheduling policy are threefold the
first scheduling policy figure of Merit
is what is called throughput and as the
name suggests what this is saying is how
many threads get executed or completed
in per unit time so that is you know how
many threads are being pushed through
the system per unit time so that's what
we're asking in this throughput and as
the name suggests it's a system centric
metric it doesn't say anything about the
performance of individual threads how
soon they are performing the work and
getting out of the system but it is
asking the question what is the
throughput of the system with respect to
the threads that needs to run on it and
the next two metrics are user centric
metrics the response time is saying if I
start up a thread how long does it take
for that threat to complete execution
and that's what response time is saying
and variance of response time is saying
well thus the time that it takes for me
to run my particular thread vary
depending on when I run it on the system
why will it very well for instance if
you think about a first-come
first-served policy if I have a very
small job to run and if it gets the
processor immediately it's going to quit
quickly complete its execution but
suppose when I start up my particular
thread there are other threads in the
system ahead of me then I'm going to
take a long time to execute then I'm
going to see a very poor response time
so depending on from run to run the same
program may experience different
response time depending on the load that
is currently on that system and that's
where the variance of response time
comes in and so clearly from a user's
perspective I want a response time to be
very good and I want the variance to be
very small as well now if you think
about first come first served scheduling
the figure of Merit that is very really
good about it is the fact that it is
fair but it doesn't pay attention to
affinity at all and and it doesn't give
importance to small jobs vs big jobs it
is just doing it first come first served
and therefore is
high variance especially if there are
small jobs that need attention of the
processor and there are long running
jobs on the processor currently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
