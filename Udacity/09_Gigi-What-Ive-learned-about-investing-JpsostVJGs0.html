with all my past investments I say that
is it's the same question like saying
would you have managed your high school
life the same that as you manage them
when you were a kid knowing all you know
now and the answer is of course no you
know I would have been great in high
school today we had a great time and
similarly when you start investing
there's many things that you miss out at
least for me there were many thing I
missed out on did I only learned over
the years I think that if there's one
thing that is the most critical thing is
that earlier on I think my balance
between team and idea was very different
I think that if you gave me a great idea
or something that looked like a great
idea with a mediocre team I might have
gone for it and I actually have in the
past because my view was which was the
wrong view that at the end the day the
idea is very material and that the
reality being at the end of the day that
as I said most companies that come even
with the best of ideas find out very
quickly that they don't have product
market fit which is a very depressing
thing you know you start out you start
running you go to the customers you do
customer discovery bang sudden you find
out that nobody wants what you thought
is the best idea in the world at that
point your ability to go back to the
drawing board come up with new
assumption try again and again and again
and again depends mostly on your
character and so if you believe like I
do that nobody is born with the ability
to predict exactly what's going to be
their idea that works anything if you're
born with that you don't know what
Google's going to do tomorrow what's
Facebook solids tomorrow right and then
you know you can work on something for
years and then Google comes and says oh
I do that for free now and so it's the
ability of the founders to look at the
market understand that look at the
customers understand their needs come up
with ideas that serve these needs and
iterate very fast to success which is
the main thing that will determine their
success ratio and so the initial idea
the only thing it does is that it tells
me whether they're really smart or not
because really smart people don't come
with really stupid ideas usually but
other than that I don't put a lot of a
lot of focus on this and I used to do
that in
so when I look at some of the companies
that I invested in early on I probably
would not have invested because I I had
thought that some of the teams were
okayish not not perfect but the ideas
were good and these companies clearly
did not succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
