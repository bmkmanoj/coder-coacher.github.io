in this exercise is to look at the
Chicago OS m data set and find all the
top level tags in this data set now what
we mean by top level tags are
essentially all the distinct different
types of tags that you're going to see
in this data set
okay so osm bounds node tag and so on
what I'd like you to do is loop through
this data set and create a dictionary
such that each time you see a particular
tag if that tag isn't already in your
dictionary you add it at the end your
dictionary should be populated by all of
the different types of tags contained in
this data set now the challenge here is
that this file is huge if we take a look
at its size I did that just a little bit
ago we can see that it's just under two
gigabytes of data now we've talked about
two different types of XML parsing in
this course
one is tree based parsing where we
essentially read the entire document
into memory and then work with it as
nodes on a tree the other way we've
talked about parsing XML is using a sax
parser or doing iterative parsing we
actually looked at the inner person for
element tree back in lesson 3 and that's
what you're going to be doing here so
instead of reading this entire file into
memory what we're going to do with inner
parse is parse it one tag at a time and
so essentially what you're doing here is
treating each time you see a tag as an
event and for each one of those events
what we're gonna be doing is checking to
see from our dictionary whether we've
seen a given tag before and I don't mean
this specific tag rather what I mean is
a tag with this name so bounds
node tag etc if you haven't seen it
before create a new key in the
dictionary and by the time you're done
parsing the file you'll have all the
unique tag names good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
