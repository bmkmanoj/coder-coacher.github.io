learning concepts incrementally this
means that a technique is going to learn
from a small set of examples that are
going to arrive one example at a time
now we have come across a different
notion of incremental concept learning
earlier and that technique we started
with the current concept definition then
a new example would come about in this
case as a negative example not an art
and then a new concept characterization
would be constructed by revising the
concept characterization that we began
with the revision was such that the new
concept characterization was a
specialization of the old concept
characterization such that that the
example got excluded so negative
examples led to specialization positive
examples led to generalization and the
ordering of these examples was important
we want the first example to be a
positive example of the concept to be
learned
we want the order to include both
positive and negative examples there
technique was very useful when there was
a teacher available who would give you
these examples in the right order now
the order of examples was very important
in that technique of incremental concept
learning we want a set of examples to
include both positive and negative
examples so that we can do
generalization and specialization and we
want each example to differ from the
previous concept characterization and
only one important feature in this case
the only important difference between a
new example and the current concept
characterization is the two breaks
taught each other that the new example
difference from the current concept
characterization in exactly one feature
is important because it focuses the
attention of the learner it tells the
learner how to do the specialization of
the generalization so as to include the
difference or to exclude the difference
this technique is very useful if a
teacher is available that can give the
examples in a good order in the right
order so the defect of learning can
occur in that technique of incremental
concept learning we also consider the
role of background knowledge if the
current concept characterization has
brick or wedge at a node and you learned
that has background knowledge which
tells it that bricks and wedges are
examples
blocks then the learner can generalize
from brick or wedge to a block here but
now we can ask two questions what
happens if these two factors the
presence of a teacher who gives examples
in a particular order and the
availability of this background
knowledge tells the learner exactly how
far to generalize in general in learning
deciding how much to generalize is a big
problem learners tend to either over
generalize in which case they come to
incorrect answers or they tend to under
generalize in which case the answer
might be correct but not very useful if
a child comes across a dog that is
folding it furry black and called buddy
and the child decides that a dog by
definition is four legged furry black
and called buddy when there is an
example of under generalization the
conceptual characterization is correct
but not very useful because we will not
transfer to any other dog on the other
hand if the child decides that all
four-legged furry animals are dogs that
is an example of over generalization
because it will also include many cats
so the question now becomes what would
happen if the examples did not come in
the good order they came in an arbitrary
order and if this background knowledge
was not available in that case the agent
would have a hard time deciding how far
to generalize version spaces the
technique that under certain conditions
allows the agent to converge to the
right generalization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
