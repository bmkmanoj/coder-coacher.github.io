to hear but thus far all of the data
that we've used in this course has been
relatively manageable what do I mean by
that well we can fit it onto one machine
pretty easily we can load it into memory
and we can run all of our analyses in a
serial fashion but imagine that we were
working with some very large data set
I'm not talking hundreds of gigabytes
here I mean terabytes or maybe even
petabytes at this point it would make
sense to introduce something like the
MapReduce programming model which allows
us to take our data distribute it across
many different machines and run our
computations in parallel if you spend
any amount of time around data science
circles
you've probably heard tons of crazy
terms like Hadoop or hive or MapReduce
or a distributed file systems more
generically you've probably heard a lot
about Big Data during this lesson we'll
discuss how to use the MapReduce
programming model to solve some very
simple problems we'll also to discuss
other big data tools like hive at a high
level that way next time you find
yourself at a data science cocktail
party you'll be able to keep up with the
conversation all right well why don't we
get started then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
