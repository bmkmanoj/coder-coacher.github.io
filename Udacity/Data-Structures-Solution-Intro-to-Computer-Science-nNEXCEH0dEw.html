choice for choice to is pretty good but
I think choice for is a little bit
better choice one and choice three would
be really difficult so let's look at how
these look to see why choice for is the
best choice so I need to shrink the
choices to have a little more room for
drawing so here's what option one would
look like we have a single list and the
elements of the list are keywords each
keyword is a string and the keywords far
followed by the URLs where that keyword
appears so for option one we have a list
and it's a single list containing
strings each string is either a keyword
or a URL and we have the keyword
followed by the URLs where that keyword
appears this seems nice and simple
there's only one list there are two real
big problems with it the first problem
is it's hard to tell the keywords apart
from the URLs maybe in this case we
could say well anything that starts with
HTTP is a URL because that's a
well-formed web link and anything that
doesn't is a keyword but we could have
key words that start with H HTTP as well
and then we couldn't tell which was
which the other really big problem with
this representation is it's very hard to
loop over the keywords to find the next
keyword if we start from keyword one we
don't know which position to look at
there are different numbers of links
that each keyword might have and we'd
have to search through every element to
try to decide whether the next thing is
a URL or the next keyword so this is not
going to work very well so option one is
definitely a bad idea so next let's look
at option 3 which was the other one that
his head really would be very difficult
so with option 3 we have a list where
each element of the list is itself a
list and the element lists are lists
where the first element in the list is
URL the second element in the list is a
list of keywords so that would be a list
of the key words that appear at that URL
so this has more structure than the
first choice we can tell apart where the
URLs are all the URLs are the first
elements of these lists and where the
keywords are which are all contained in
the second element of the contained
lists the problem with this approach is
it's not going to make it easy to look
up the pages
we're a keyword appears this is almost
like having to scan all the pages over
again to look for a particular keyword
we've gotta look in each entry look in
the second part of that and your entry
scan it to see if that keyword appears
if it does well then we want this URL in
our result if it doesn't then that URL
is not in the result but to find
particular keywords we've got to look
through each entry look through all of
the keywords in that entry so this
options not going to work very well our
goal in making the index was to be able
to make lookups fast so we don't have to
look through all the content of the
pages and this representation doesn't
solve that problem so we have two
choices left and I said both of these
choices could work okay but i think the
fourth option is the best one so let's
look at why so this is option B we have
a list where each element of the list of
the list and the element lists are
themselves list which contain the
keyword followed by URLs where that
keyword appears this has a big advantage
over the first two options it means it's
easy to tell the key words from the URLs
the keyword is always the first element
of the list and unlike the previous
option it's also easy to go through the
keywords for each list contained we just
need to look at the first element to see
if that's the key word we're looking for
if not we go in the next one we don't
need to look through all the content in
all the web pages we just need to look
at the first elements in these lists to
find the key word we're looking for so
that's okay the reason that I think
option D is better is it makes a better
separation between the keywords and the
URLs so the difference between this and
option D is an option D instead of the
inner list being flat lists that are the
keyword followed by the URLs the inner
list has just two elements it has the
keyword followed by a list of URLs so
that'll be another list and now we have
a list of URLs so this is option D each
element of the main list is a list and
it's a list that just contains two
elements it contains the key word here
the keyword Udacity followed by a list
containing all the URLs where that
keyword appears
the reason I like this better than the
second option is that it really makes a
clear separation between the keyword and
the list of URLs it means if we decide
we want to keep track of something else
say we want to keep track of the number
of times someone searches for each
keyword we could easily do that we could
have an extra element here that keeps
track of the number of times someone
searches for something with option B it
wouldn't be that clear how to do that
maybe we could add an extra value in
here we could add a number in here we
would need to change a lot of code we
already wrote instead of looking for
URLs starting from position one we'd
have to start from position to now maybe
we should put the number at the end to
avoid that problem well then we have the
problem of we've got to find where the
number is there are easy ways to find
the last element a list but it's going
to make things much more complicated and
if we start adding more and more things
we're going to have a hard time keeping
track of everything option D gives us a
lot more structure by keeping all the
URLs in a list we can treat that as a
list and do things with it much more
easily than if it's combined with the
keyboard and we can also do things like
add X or elements if we want to keep
track of the number of times someone
searches for that keyword or any other
information we think of later that would
be useful to add to our structure so
that's why I think option D is the best
option and deciding on data structures
is one of the most important things we
do when we build software if you pick
the right data structure oftentimes the
rest of the code is fairly easy to write
if you start with the wrong data
structure say we started with the
structure that was choice a or choice C
well then it's going to be very very
difficult sometimes it's going to be
impossible to write the code in a way
that performs well so thinking about
data structures is one of the most
important things we do in computer
science we'll see that some more in this
course will also they have following
courses that really focus on this
question of how to design and use data
structures well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
