consensus sequences in this case the
Tata sequence right the ideal or
consensus sequence here's ta ta AAA and
we given three examples in the first
example of t-80 g80 so it's not
identical to the consensus sequence but
we're going to change it from the t-80
g82 eight ta ta 80 and if it's more
similar to the consensus sequence then
we would expect it to have an increase
in the effect of transcription right the
closer you are to the Tata sequence the
more likely you are going to be to the
ideal conditions of promoting
transcription so we need to determine if
that's true for any of these examples so
dat g80 changing the ta ta 80 now that
fourth position change from a G which
wasn't part of the consensus sequence
now to an a that is so this would be
considered an up promoter because we got
more similar to the Tata sequence and
that's going to increase transcription
and the next one we change dat g80 but
we took the second letter an A and
changed it to a tee so we went from the
consensus a letter at the second
position to a non consensus letter this
is going to have a negative effect on
transcription because we're moving away
from the consensus sequence even more so
there'd be a Down promoter and the last
one we changed the last position T to an
a so it got actually switched to a more
consensus like sequence so this would
actually be an up promoter mutation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
