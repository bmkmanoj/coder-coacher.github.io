you need to be prepared for a number of
iterations until your pre and post
conditions are accurate your typical
chain of tools looks like this here you
do have test inputs either randomly
generated or systematically generated or
coming from users or coming from
production these tests inputs are being
checked by preconditioned and the
results of the computation will be
checked by post conditions now as it
comes to preconditions and
postconditions you can be either too
permissive or you can be too strict if
you are too permissive with your
preconditions this means that inputs
which shouldn't go into the function go
into the function and then result in
arbitrary behavior if you are too strict
with the preconditions this means that
valid inputs will result in failing
preconditions the same also applies for
post conditions if you are too
permissive with your post conditions
this means that you will not catch a
number of bugs if you are too strict
however then you will catch bugs where
there are no bugs the key is to come up
with the right balance between these two
we don't want to be too permissive you
don't want to be too strict in theory
you'd like to have preconditions and
postconditions that capture exactly what
the program is doing however in practice
you will find that while writing
preconditions is typically easy writing
post conditions or regular functions can
be very hard and therefore is very
common for post conditions only to check
a part of the actual state that is you
have post conditions that are simple but
a bit too permissive that is there miss
errors whereas for preconditions it's
frequently feasible to come up with the
right level of precision why is it that
post conditions are so complex to give
you a simple example of why writing
correct post conditions is not easy at
all let me give you a very simple
example let's assume we do have a
sorting function the precondition for a
sorting function is simple basically we
simply assume that X is a list well we
could put up an appropriate assertion
here but the precondition is to accept
essentially anything for the post
condition we have to make sure two
things first we assume that the list why
that we will return
actually is sorted but we also need to
make sure that list we return is a
permutation of our input list so let's
go and check whether list is sorted we
iterate over the elements of Y and if
one element is greater than its
successor we return false otherwise we
return true so what you see here is that
in order to check the post condition we
needed to come up with another function
which actually now should again be
checked against what the property that
is sorted checks here is essentially
already described in here meaning that
any assertion you could have it would be
just the same as anything you have in
here so you simply have to believe that
this is true well I didn't believe that
I actually ran a number of tests so I'm
pretty confident that this works now
this is just assorted you also have to
come up with is permutation with is also
something you'd have to define help of
functions like is sorted or is
permutation will probably be helpful
later in the future because you may be
able to reuse them for other purposes
they may even become part of a library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
