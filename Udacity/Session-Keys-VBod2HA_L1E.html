message security Alice and Bob will need
to establish a shared secret key for a
session this can be accomplished in
several ways suppose Alice and Bob share
a master secret key then Alice can use
this master secret to ink up a new key
and send the encrypted new key to Bob or
Alice and Bob can also use public keys
to encrypt a new key we say that Alice
and Bob should Xterra
a shared key for each new session this
is true even if Alice and Bob already
has a shared secret key typically Alice
and Bob share a long-term secret key and
we call it the master key for example
the master key can be derived from a
password for each session Alice and Bob
would use the master secret key to
authenticate and establish a new key for
the session then all messages in the
session are protected using the session
key the main benefit of using session
key is that if the key is leaked or
broken the impact is limited only to the
current session intuitively the more a
secret is used the higher the chance
that the secret can be leaked
therefore we should limit the use of the
long term master secret and only use it
at the beginning of a session for
authentication and establishing the
session key he is an example suppose
Alice and Bob already share a master key
kab the first three steps are just for
Alice to authenticate Bob say Bob is a
server then both Bob and Alice computers
same session key that's based on the Sri
master key and something about the
current session so that the session key
is both a secret and unique to the
session so for example they can add 100
to the master key and use the result as
the key to income R which is a challenge
use in this session to authenticate
Alice to Bob and the result of
encrypting or using a modified master
key is
the shared session key Alice and Bob can
also use their public keys to exchange a
shared session key for example Alice can
send to Bob a key encrypted using Bob's
public key so the only Bob can decrypt
and get the key and then signs the
result using Alice's private key so
there Bob knows that the key is sent by
Alice Oh Alice and Bob can use their
private keys to sign the public messages
that they exchanged in a DV Hellman key
exchange protocol and this can prevent
the men in the middle attack that is
when Alice sends Bob the public message
she signs it
likewise when Bob sends Alice the public
message he signs it with his private key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
