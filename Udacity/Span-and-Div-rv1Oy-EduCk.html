these are called span and div span and
div are both normal elements they can
both have content and the only
difference between these two is span is
inline and div is block we'll play
around with these in the editor a little
bit but these elements don't do anything
other than just contain their content
and there's a way to attach styles to
them to adjust different behaviors of
how they display that looks something
like this
so you can see I've added two attributes
or an attribute to each of these called
class and this is a CSS class and this
is a not something we're going to spend
a whole lot of time on in this course
I'll provide mostly CSS but it's a
separate language for adding styles to
your documents or changing the changing
how different text looks and we'll be
using spans and divs a lot for you know
controlling how text is laid out but the
important thing to remember is that
spans are inline and divs are block
let's play around with these on the
browser a little bit real quick so you
can see what I'm talking about okay so
we've got our text and our first line is
wrapped in span and it behaves as as we
would expect an inline element to behave
now if I were to change the span to a
div it behaves more like how the
paragraph tag before behaved this div is
actually this creates a box around this
piece of text and you can see my we
actually did something interesting I
added a little period after the div and
the period appears down on the second
line here what I'd like you to do is
check all the elements that are in line
some of these elements you haven't seen
before so I would like you to try them
out in your own browser and figure it
out for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
