mm-hmm we don't really care about the
other column anymore then what's going
to happen is a is mixing between
resigning and holding yep and
probability P is it probably being a
holder so whenever P whenever that event
happens it gets 10 and whatever one the
opposite of it happens you gets minus
five so i want to say 10 p plus 1 minus
p 5 okay cuz that read it again this is
your final answer 10 p well i could
simplify it okay well then say it to me
again I'll write it out here so it's
easy for you to say okay and that is my
answer that's fair do you want to
simplify it you don't have to sure let
me simplify it so it's a minus minus p 5
and a 10p so that's 15 p minus 1 minus
what 1 minus what five mm-hmm there you
go thank you that's correct uh we would
obviously accept either answer or any
combination of those orders well I think
I might have to do this quiz over
actually no not the one I'm talking
about either 15 p minus 5 or 10 p minus
1 minus P times 5 or 10 p plus 1 minus p
x minus 5 or any other combination that
we can get pushkar to actually bother to
implement or check okay well that one's
pretty good and this of course is
exactly the expected profit is you put
it p times a's a holder and p times or p
percentage 1 minus p percentage a choose
to be a resigner and so it's just a
weighted average between those two
values so let me just double check that
so if p is 0 that means it never holds
it means it always resins and it gets
minus five so that's right and if p is
one means it always holds so it should
get a plus 10 and 15 minus 5 is 10 so
boom yeah it works you used math they're
very good okay what about B be so the
same story except on the seer side so I
yeah I might need that space again so
500 I see right minus 5 times p mm-hmm
plus 5 times 1 minus P mm-hmm if we
simplify that we get there's a minus 5
and another minus 5 so we get minus 10 p
mm-hmm + 1 + work + 5 there you go
so you learn okay you want to check it
yeah that's good idea so again if P is
one then that means you're always a
holder which should be the minus 5 and
if we put into one there we get 5-10 as
minus 5 and if P is zero that means
we're always a resigner and we should
get a 5 for that and yeah so we 0 at the
negative 10 and we get the five exactly
now it's not clear to me why we're
playing this game oh it is clear to me
why we're playing this game because we
want to figure out something about a
strategy that is mixed right so this is
how well and make strategy does but not
against another mix strategy this is
against to deterministic strategies ah
but is it Michael but is it so ok I'm
going to notice something here which is
that you as you astutely pointed out
earlier we have two functions of P or
two equations of P and by the way do you
know what they are their lines sure
because it's just it's linear in P so
that's what linear means right so what
would happen you you think if we would
actually draw these lines I think we'd
have two nights yes and what would those
two lines look like let's take a look
shall we sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
