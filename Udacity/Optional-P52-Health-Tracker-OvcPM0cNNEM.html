everybody welcome to another webcast
today joining me is ty and he's going to
sit down and talk to us a little bit
about backbone we're going to kind of go
over some of the basics of backbone and
what it allows you to do for those of
you who are unfamiliar with backbone and
where it fits into the course where it's
part of the optional health tracker web
application that's mediately after the
neighborhood map and ultimately
backbones just another framework which
is going to include models collections
and views and this project is really you
know meant to kind of let you branch out
explore this new framework let you
explore something other than knockout
and backbone is actually pretty common
in a lot of web applications and this
actually kind of holding together a lot
of really really big app web
applications out there so it's a pretty
desirable skill to have worked in
backbone and have built something with
it so I guessed I you want to introduce
yourself and explain to people what
backbone is yeah sure John so hey
everybody just like John I'm a front-end
coach here at Udacity and I'm also a
full-stack web developer so I guess you
know the first logical thing to start
with is what is backbone and it's a
front-end JavaScript MVC framework for
those of you that don't know what MVC is
it stands for Model View controller and
it's basically a design paradigm to help
you kind of separate your front end
application into logical components so
like the model provides structure for
your applications data for example like
storing representing people in a
database you could have a person model
something like that the view as the name
suggests has to do with the UI of your
application and it is the view is always
updated based on changes to the model
generally or reactant to user input so
that's how the users interact with your
data and the application itself and the
controller which is the sea part of MVC
you can consider kind of the brain of
the application to some degree it
updates both the model and the view
tying everything together so we'll go
back to John briefly and talk
about getting set up with backbone for a
bit yeah and i think you know it's
always good to remind everybody to you
like what and be seen as i know that
should be for those of you who have gone
through project five and everything
should be pretty familiar at this point
but it's it's easy to kind of forget
what each component is each component is
used for and you'll probably hear it
called referred to as a bunch of
different things like the alphabet soup
right model view viewmodel model view
controller Model View presenter and
first generals you know purposes you can
kind of consider them all the same thing
when you start digging deeper you
realize there's like these small little
differences but generally then what
we'll be dealing with is you know the
MVC model view controller now as far as
setting up backbone it's really
straightforward it's just that it's just
you know tiny little script it's pretty
tiny framework yeah you have breast I
think it's like 8 kilobytes right yeah
super super super tiny compared to like
some of these bigger ones you have out
there like a member angular but
obviously right that that small size
means you're not going to kind of get
some of the more stronger architecture
like you get with angular and ember or
some of just the more you know robust
set of tools backbone is just like a
very stripped down MVC framework a lot
of the decision-making is going to be
left up to you and you're not going to
have a lot of these sort of fancy ways
to do things like you have with angular
and ember or you know some of the other
big frameworks out there but you know
fortunately it makes set up pretty easy
you just go download it from backbone.js
org or you can use a package manager
like Bauer for those of you who haven't
used bowery yet there's a whole forum
post about it or you can just go to
baauer io to check that out and from
there you know you only need two
dependencies to run it jquery and
underscore jquery it largely uses to
sort of interact with the dom and then
underscore uses for templating which
out of the box backbone doesn't provide
so it just relies on underscore to do a
lot of the templating and some other
helper functions included with that and
the cool thing is is along with you know
being able to bring these in from Bauer
or bring these you know download these
and include them in your project you can
also just use a CDN to bring them all in
and just include them as you know links
in your header tag or you know as
scripts at the bottom of your file
that's pretty much all there is to it to
like get backbone included in your
project really really straightforward
it's not like something like react where
you have to set up like an entire build
process to compile your code into usable
JavaScript it's really straightforward
it's written in native JavaScript so
should run real easily just by importing
those scripts so yeah that's that's
pretty much setting up I think the next
thing we want to kind of cover here is
to talk a little bit about models and
collections and I think ty you wanted to
talk to everybody a little bit about
that yeah so you know as with most
applications data is a very important
aspect of them so the way back bone
handles your data is through what they
call models and collections which is the
same em and you know the same em from
MVC and collections you could consider
like backbones database for holding
models I think it's important to note
that the the models aren't necessarily
persistent like this isn't like putting
your data into a database right yeah
we're not working with like sequel or
MongoDB here yet you can interact with
those but this is strictly providing
structure for your data within the code
it's not actually saving it any in any
kind of file yet or on any kind of
remote database nothing like that you
can certainly do that but this is just
backbones lingo for a providing
structure for your data so when I say
model I mean backbone model not like any
kind of database so I think the concept
of models and collections are pretty
straightforward so I actually want to
jump right into an example so I'm going
to screen share with you guys and zoom
in a bit so you can see where are we
so you guys should be able to see that
John how does that look on your end it
looks pretty good maybe zoom in just a
little little bit more but it looks
pretty good on my side yeah is that
readable yeah rootable okay so we'll
just step through this so we can ignore
the first couple lines I've basically
just wrapped all of the code in an
anonymous function after the webcast is
over we'll be uploading a forum post
I'll explain why that's kind of an
important in front-end code but I'm not
super relevant right now so we can see
right here starting on line 4 I have
created a person model and it's pretty
easy what you do is you take the
function that backbone provides model
backbone top model and you just call the
extend function and pass in an object
with your customizations so that's you
know just a base to use the model at the
basic level there's really not much you
have to do all I've done is kind of
provide some default for lit to describe
some defaults to basically described
like what the structure of every person
is going to look like and each person is
going to have at the minimum a name age
and gender and I've just kind of picked
some like sensible or at least sensible
to me defaults and empty strings and
negative one so that's it as far as
creating the model pretty readable and
then we're actually going to use that
person model to make me thi sao thi
Lucas Kelly 20 years old male there we
are and once you've actually created
that variable and you can make much more
than one if you want accessing a what is
it accessing elements in the model is as
simple as saying ty get and that in this
case I got the name were you to run this
code had you imported backbone and all
of that it would get a little pop-up
that says ty Lucas Kelly if I wanted to
change my name later it's just tied set
name and then the name I want to change
to and I am now Homer Simpson
unfortunately so at the basic level
that's really all there is two models
and again we'll be providing much more
links to
documentation and more advanced
tutorials after the webcast on the
forums um so where do we become Homer
Simpson unfortunately like it's a bad
thing for you know a good thing in the
earlier Simpson seasons maybe not now
that we're on like season 30 or 300 or
whatever so that's a model and then
there is a collection which you can
consider a container for models so i
made a person model and we're going to
make a collection called people to put
persons inside of so I've over in this
file now which I've called collection
j/s and we have the same stuff from
before the person model nothing is
changed and then we create online 14 or
15 rather a people collection and you
kind of interact with it the same way
you did with the model which is
collection dot extend and then you pass
in your customizations so all we have to
do at the bare minimum is point to the
model that we want to be storing in this
collection so that nothing else gets
inside of it otherwise it's just a big
array essentially we create a collection
respire invoking the people function and
then just like before i made thai here i
am this time I'm not Homer Simpson and
then the way I add myself to that people
collection is with people dot add so
again very readable backbone is meant to
be simple and kind of stripped down so
let's say I wanted to put a bunch of
stuff in the the collection and now I
want to get something out I would say
there are two ways you can do that i
could say people dot get thai which is
the actual model i just pass in the
entire model and then obviously it's
pretty easy for it to verify that it has
that in there and then once i get it
back i can get my name again or change
things i'm actually working with the
model itself at this point or if you
provided like an ID number like a unique
ID for the model you could get it by
that so like people dot get 0 or 10,000
or whatever the ideas so either way is
acceptable there again there's
definitely a lot more that you can do
with models and collect
including things like pointing them to
like a remote MongoDB database something
like that but you know that's not what
this webcast is all about but again
after we will be providing plenty of
links and tutorials for you guys to dive
into and the course itself that you can
take on Udacity com so that's all I want
to say about models and collections for
now and that brings us to the V the
middle part of MVC and back to John
actually I actually have a question oh
sure and I'm not a hundred percent sure
if you know the answer and I admit I
don't expect you to because I'm kind of
just throwing it to you off the cuff ya
go by so like for for a person model if
I were to you know I set these defaults
and then I say you know in your example
it was named a gendered age if I did
something like a new person and then I
passed in a name and it a gender in an
age and then I passed in something else
like I don't know GPA let's say like a
grade point average just like through
like another argument into the the new
constructor with that with that fail
would it add that to that particular
person um so actually backbone doesn't
really i'm not sure if you can enforce
the i'd like to stick to the defaults
that i specified but now you can totally
just add in an arbitrary amount of extra
variable so you could create a new
property called favorite sport and call
it fall or something and it wouldn't
complain or give you any errors so the
whole reason we define the defaults is
more just for like code readability and
so that you know as the developer you
kind of know what's supposed to go in
there I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard
to figure out if you can kind of enforce
those defaults um actually huh okay cool
so there's actually a model dot validate
function which that you can call and in
the case that you did provide like extra
arbitrary variables it would then yell
at you but it's up to you actually to
write that valid
asian function it's you know again kind
of like we were mentioning before
backbone leaves a lot up to you the
whole idea is performance and you know
small size bare bones but yeah so to
answer your question yes and no it
doesn't do it by default but the option
is there for sure okay yeah just kind of
curious what would happen that's a good
thing good thing to know about yeah I
haven't really tried that myself I'm
usually pretty anal about like massaging
her creating my model so it exactly
matches like the data I'm pulling in
from so I was just curious what would
happen if you know something something
through you know stam stick in the
spokes on that one yeah definitely good
for like a larger team to be able to
actually enforce the validation though
if you're working by yourself probably
not a huge issue mm-hmm um okay so what
was I supposed to be talking about the
view the VF areum oh yeah so you know
the view is all about displaying things
right the models and collections are
about sort of creating this data into
some usable format but it doesn't really
present this data to our user so that's
really what the the view is for enough
of you is all about so really you know
when you want something that have change
in your model and be presented to the
user that's that's really what the view
is going to be handling so working with
the view involves really just two things
one writing a template in your HTML
files and that's going to provide sort
of the layout or structure for your view
and this is largely where underscore
comes in like I mentioned before that
was one of the dependencies for backbone
and then the actual view code which is
you know the JavaScript that fills in
data from the models and uses your
template as a base so let's take a look
at this a quick example here that we
have written up lemme screen share I
don't have fancy or I do have fancy Adam
but i rather use sublime so I hope that
looks good on your guys's end yeah
totally clear for me but again you can
see we kind of have
this wrapping anonymous function with
you're not going to worry too much about
but just like the model we have this
view function that basically says you
know this is going to be a view objects
going to be a view method so we just
call backbone debutant extend and first
we pass in this L property which is
going to be the the dom element that
we're going to binding to so in this
case we're just binding to the body and
you can see that this is a pretty
standard jQuery selector just the dollar
sign and then the element this could
also be right any sort of div or any
sort of class that we decide to pass
into it maybe you want to attach it to
like the main or even ID selector so it
supports you know anything you can
select on the pic Dom if just plain old
jQuery plain old jquery yeah real simple
there so then we have this initialize
argument which is basically this
function going to be assigned to this
function and it's going to call this
render function this is basically what's
called when review is created and
typically you just use it to call a
render function but you can also do a
lot of setup and sort of this
initialized step prior to calling render
so if you need to sort of manipulate
some things are you know pre manage some
data or you know maybe make some
asynchronous requests before you fully
like render the view you can kind of do
it in this initialization step so then
this one's pretty simple like I
mentioned it just calls this dot render
which is our backbones under function
and this is just going to basically set
up this pretty simple little template
here it's just going to make this list
item which says hey there this dot L as
you remember from above is actually our
body element so this is just a selector
saying like ok pick that body element
append this little chunk of stuff and
then we down here actually instantiate
our new list view which will throw it up
onto the page so that's the basic
premise of you there's a few other kind
of tricky things you can get away with
in there but generally speaking this is
what most of you
these are going to look like that stop
screen sharing there and it looks like
there are too many questions on slack or
on the side so we'll move on real quick
to the next thing which i believe is
talking about immense yeah so back to me
for that you know if you've been
programming with java script at all
you've probably encountered events
before it's just a huge part of a
javascript and backbone to their kind of
what makes the application come to life
and able to react to user input as well
as changes to like the the model and
collection that we mentioned before you
know if you use jquery specifically
you've probably seen something like this
so let me screen share real quick okay
so you guys can see that so you have
seen events before most likely so in
this little comment right here I threw
in a classic use of jQuery which is what
to do when the click event was fired
after clicking a button in this case it
just logs some nonsense to the console
but yeah so you've seen events before
most likely and now we're going to
actually work with events in the context
of backbone so we're taking that list
view from before in John's example so
everything is the same so far the
element is the body we've actually added
a little more I've created an actual
HTML file here so ignore the errors but
there's the body and we've made a button
to add items and remove them and then
here is our list right here so pretty
simple but I will be referencing that so
BAM events as you can see this is
backbone syntax for dealing with events
and you basically create this event
object which is all the events you want
the view to handle and then the key you
have the event name which is click you
know just fired upon clicking anything
and then the element that is being
clicked separated by a space
and then the actual value in the key
value pair is the name of the function
we're going to call and you guessed it
we are the ones that right that function
so quickly scrolling past this is the
same as before except we're calling it
on the list tag this time or ID rather
but you can see the add item and remove
item functions and they basically are
pretty simple when you click the add
item button it's going to add another
list item and when you click remove item
it's going to remove the last item so
nothing too crazy and as before we have
to actually instantiate the list view
but that is actually the basics of
working with events and backbone you
know just like with everything else
we've done so far it's pretty readable
and like quick to pick up on which is
very nice not nearly as complex as a lot
of other JavaScript frameworks but I
yeah this object right here is
essentially mapping events two functions
and that's all there is to events in
backbone so i will stop screen sharing
and think we have unless there's
questions i think we only have one more
thing to talk about yeah I think we'll
we'll take questions at the end here but
um but the last little bit I think you
know a lot of people are curious about
is you know we mentioned before these
models you're creating they don't really
persist they're not like a model in the
sense that it's something that gets
stored in a database and that you can
kind of retrieve later when you create
these models there they're very
destructive they basically get destroyed
once the backbone application goes down
so you know in that instance where the
page gets refreshed or the PA or the
page gets reversed so like in that
instance where ty said you know tied
create there was a new person equals ty
blah blah you know that that that object
is basically going to get destroyed the
next time the session reloads so to get
persistent data and something we talked
a little bit about you guys doing in the
health tracker project is utilizing
local storage and so backbone can can
utilize a browser local storage pretty
easily most browsers have some local
storage support chrome does firefox says
I think Safari does now yep and on the
latest versions of ie and the new edge
browser as well yeah so as long as
you're not trying to support you know a
lot of IE eight clients and stuff like
that you can probably get away with
using local storage and so you know it's
it's a database of sorts and it's a
really easy library to sort of integrate
into your projects and so it is pretty
easy to implement let me screen share
here this little little snippet of code
there we go and let me make this a
little smaller so you can see everything
but you can see in the collection that
we create we specify the model that we
want and then we just specify local
storage and use this new backbone top
local storage and then give it some
collection name so this could be
something like you know we'll store and
I could you know how all our people let
me end up creating so now anytime we you
know put you know information into this
local stores it's going to get saved
there it's basically going to get cached
to that URL and then when users come
back the data will persist at least for
a little while unless they you know go
in and clear clear their browser history
and mess with a bunch of stuff but
generally you know local storage is a
pretty simple method for for making
persistent data without having to go out
and learn a huge
based framework like Mongo or just
bazillion other ones that are out there
so that's really it if you guys are
looking to learn a little bit more you
definitely should go through our
backbone jas class which has a lot of
great material in there we reference a
lot of great articles and we'll make
sure to share a lot of these useful
links as well but it looks like we have
some questions that need to be answered
so how about we go through those and try
and hit on as many of them as we can if
you guys are posting questions in slack
as well I'd be happy to take them there
so let's see Roger Woodroof says p52 is
optional is it possible to complete the
nanodegree minimum requirements graduate
and then come back and do p52 after
graduating and still be able to submit
p52 for review and I actually was not a
hundred percent sure about this before
we started the webcast but I just talked
with Durant who's one of our CMS on the
career services side and he says yeah
you know graduates you guys have access
to your paths and are able to submit
optional projects for review even after
graduating so yeah you guys are more
than welcome to finish up project five
finish up project six and then graduate
come back do project 52 and submit that
one since it's optional if you do have
any trouble submitting it for whatever
reason like I don't know maybe you know
the system doesn't let you submit it you
know feel free to email in to us at
support at Udacity calm and we'll make
sure to get that set up right for you
this one comes to us from mood am who
asks I'm creating a disposable set of
views for third-party data ie they have
no attached models or collections the
user can elect to save specific results
what's the best approach to harvesting
harvesting the data behind that view
or should I just create models to begin
with I'm leaning whatever else may yeah
I'm leaning towards like the making
models to begin with yeah it's just
that's the way the framework was meant
to be used and that's going to be the
least painful and most importantly
easiest to find documentation and help
for if anything goes wrong so if you
have any kind of data that you need to
work with definitely go with the models
and collections route rather than
rolling your own solutions um yeah I
would agree with that too if you're if
you're looking for a framework that you
know just you can do something like that
with and doesn't rely on like models or
collections then you're probably looking
for something like react which is
strictly like a vm reactive in a way to
go yeah that that's essential that's
actually like damn near the description
for a reactor is just like a set of
views that you can kind of disposed of
and set this date on and with backbone
though I mean it's it still relies
heavily on on well-defined models and
collections yeah otherwise things start
to kind of look like spaghetti code and
the whole point of backbone kind of
falls through the floor in terms of a
you know clean application architecture
yeah I feel like you'd end up using a
lot of like jQuery if you just used to
use with no modeler you'd end up
basically writing writing a model done
without meaning to I feel like that
would be the end result um all right
let's see here I'm just I'm gonna check
the slack channels real quick bo chef
says he doesn't really have a question
he was having some trouble getting into
the the webcast so hopefully we can
deliver the recording to him but he says
he's starting a new job next monday and
they have some backbone applications
there hey awesome so yeah I mean like
any any advice I guess we can give to
tubo about you know stepping into to
doing like real real heavy lifting with
backbone um so I guess not too much
quick advice I can give right now but
definitely look out for our forum post
which is going to have links to much
more advanced tutorials that will
probably help you a ton in like the
workplace environment yeah definitely
and luckily you'll be able to you know
lean on your co-workers shoulders to to
you know learn how things work over
there but congrats on the new job yeah I
was just gonna say that too is when you
when you're stepping into this goes i
guess with any framework and any job you
step into right there's going to be a
particular way that their engineers are
doing things there's going to be a
particular framework that they all like
to use and there's going to be a
particular style that they like to stick
to so you know you can come in with the
basics but definitely you know ask
questions inquire about gay i understand
how backbone works a little bit but i
kind of need to understand how you guys
make back that work let's see this one
comes to us from Robert what are the
strengths / weaknesses of backbone
versus knockout so i guess i can
strengths of both of them i guess is
that they're pretty light really
lightweight you're not getting into a
overly large architecture I guess versus
each other um knock out in my opinion is
very much more convention over
configuration where you're you're
sitting down and you're writing a lot of
of code
whereas backbone is I think a little bit
more structure that knockout and so you
kind of have the little bit more of this
configuration setup where you're
basically defining more more or less
you're defining these objects and their
properties whereas with knockout your
kind of writing the code building those
objects and properties yeah and if I can
chime in real quick so both these
frameworks that they're similar in the
sense they both kind of fill that kind
of smaller second tier a niche in terms
of JavaScript frameworks they're not
quite as big and all-encompassing is
something like angular or ember you know
and as a result there a lot simpler and
lightweight the one big difference
between the two frameworks is in
something that's called two-way data
binding so this is something that
knockout has and backbone does not so in
knockout it's a little bit simpler to
have your views and models kind of stay
up to date with each other where its
backbone you have to do a little more if
the wiring yourself it's certainly not
you know impossible to do the same
things with both frameworks but that is
one small advantage of knockout is it's
a little simpler to UM keep things up to
date with each other without any like
Dom manipulation or kind of manual
konima not sure what the word I'm
looking for is oh yes that that's about
the only big difference between the two
they both kind of fill the same void in
terms of like a small lightweight
JavaScript framework yeah hi I tend to
lean a little bit more towards knockout
largely because of the two-way data
binding and the ease of setup with that
it's not terribly difficult with
backbone it just is a little bit more
work yeah not luck luckily because
backbones been around for a little while
or you know both frameworks have their
there's a lot of like good third-party
code out there and open source code you
can find to kind of take care of some of
the heavy lifting for you but yeah
that's about it on that all right let's
see if we can help this guy
and Sue Prada asks I'm trying to build a
backbone application which interacts
with files on Google Drive where should
i place the google api calls in the
model or the controller ah the
controller would be the place for that
any interaction with third party AAP is
or outside resources should go there the
model should purely be for defining the
structure of your data you want to keep
that as kind of pure quote unquote as
possible so definitely go for the
controller if you're working with the
Google Drive API yeah I I agree with
that that's right basically right from
the definition of what the controller is
right it's the it's all the code that
interacts with the model and
interactions of you and in this case you
know that API call fits perfectly into
that sort of peace let's see robert asks
do you have a screenshot of a sample
interface for this project so a sample
of the health tracker I think do you
have a copy on your on your laptop right
now I might here let me let me see if I
can whip something up real quick give me
a second yeah and a problem I don't know
if I'll double-check my laptop too but I
don't i recently liked it a fully reset
the other day all right here we go I can
share something so there's a bit of
setup with the project that i have on
right now so the UI isn't going to quite
work correctly without throwing a bunch
of errors there's some like API keys I
need to put in there but as far as the
basic what the you I could look like if
you wanted to implement it yourself
lovely screen share perfect
so that's about that so you can see
there's a little search bar at the top
the title of the application search
results are going to go on this left
third and then this is the actual health
tracker that keeps track of how many
calories you've had so that's a you know
pretty basic not too fancy with the CSS
but that's kind of a good structure for
this type of application search bar at
the top search results at the left and
then the actual report taking up most of
the screen so there's a little sneak
peek at what we came up with yeah and
just since since there is we can't
really show off the interactivity I got
a link we gotta leave some work for you
guys but basically right you just type
into that little search bar and then
like a whole list of categories or sorry
a list of results of food would come up
the user would be able to pick one and
basically add it to their what they ate
that day or week or whatever yeah and
there's much more details of course in
the actual backbone course we have on
our website and the the project rubric
yeah we definitely encourage you to make
it not so plain um we're just radically
with men on top with the CSS we're just
a shame we're just lazy and need to get
things working so we use a lot of
bootstrap I will never complain I will
never claim to be a designer I respect
those that can make that claim I know I
was a i was perusing job listings just
seeing what people were asking for her
like junior and senior friend and web
developers and there is a large
misunderstanding of what a front-end
developer in front end designer are
there's so many that are like okay we
need you to know HTML CSS JavaScript hey
I'm Jonny finish up and do different
paths oh no if you can if you can learn
it all then you should have no problem
getting a job anywhere yeah props to you
if you've got development and artistic
ability hi I prefer sticking with like
some of the more intense development
stuff
um all right I think we got time for one
more question here and it's kind of a
fun one which is from etienne and he
asks what brand of coffee do we buy oh
boy toughest question okay I'm a big
coffee and tea drinker I don't really
buy any one particular brand but I am
picky with a buying whole bean coffee
needs to be ground right before I'm
about to drink it um the the coffee I'm
hooked on lately you can actually get it
at a if you've got a trader joes near
you it's this a new Mexican Fairtrade
blend they have it's very very nice it's
got a nutty flavor um as far as like if
I'm out and about grabbing a cup of
coffee uh not too much preference um
starbucks over Dunkin Donuts I guess not
to start a flame war um I guess and I'm
kind of on the same boat as you uh not
not too particular as long as it's not
crappy and as long as it's yeah good
coffee that's the easy answer fresh um I
guess my drink of choice by the pic ones
like americano just straight espresso in
the cup with some water caffeine IV yeah
pretty much all right I don't think we
got any other questions here I'm just
gonna take a quick glance at slack looks
like we're okay for those of you who are
watching the recording and weren't able
to get in I am sorry about that we're
going to do our best to to host this on
something that doesn't require being a
part of the Google+ community beforehand
I think the next one we're going to do
is going to be hosted on on youtube live
so there won't be any sort of like gate
and we won't have to try and like accept
people as they're trying to join in any
way is any last thoughts on anything
today ty um no I hope you guys you know
we're able to get a nice intro to
backbone and get your feet wet again
definitely keep an eye out for the forum
post that's going to be coming right
after this it'll have basically
everything week
today as well as some important links to
code examples and tutorials things like
that yeah and along with with that you
know will be taking questions there so
you know feel free to post any other
questions that you might have let us
know where you're struggling with
backbone where you're struggling with
the project we're always happy to dive
in and give you guys some support all
right cool things ty say everybody
