subtlety of the difference between
problems in pea and those that are
np-complete is to compare what it takes
to solve seemingly similar real-world
problems consider the shortest path
problem you're given two locations and
you want to find the shortest valid
route between them your phone does this
in a matter of milliseconds when you ask
it for directions and it gives you an
exact answer according to whatever model
for distance it is using this is
computationally tractable on the other
hand consider this warehouse scenario
for a customer in places in order for
several different items and a person or
a robot has to go around and collect
them before going to the shipping area
for them to be packed of course we want
to do this as quickly as possible this
is called the Traveling Salesman problem
and it is np-complete this problem also
comes up and the unofficial guide to
Disney World which tries to tell you how
to get to all the rides as quickly as
possible
this explains why your phone can give
you directions but supply chain and
logistics just figuring out how things
should be routed is a billion-dollar
industry actually however we don't even
need to change the shortest path so much
to get an np-complete problem instead of
asking for a shortest path we could ask
for the longest simple path we have to
say simple so that we don't just run
around in cycles forever that also would
give us an np-complete problem this
isn't the only possible pairing of
similar P and NP complete problems
either I'm going to list some more if
you aren't familiar with these problems
yet don't worry you will learn about
them by the end of the course vertex
cover and bipartite graphs is polynomial
but vertex cover in general graphs is
np-complete a class of optimization
problems called linear programming is in
P but if we restrict the solutions to
integers then we get an np-complete
problem finding a nor Larian cycle in a
graph where you touch each edge once is
polynomial on the other hand finding a
Hamiltonian cycle that touches each
vertex once is np-complete and lastly
figuring out whether boolean formula
with two literals per Clause is
polynomial but if there are three
literals per Clause then the problem is
np-complete
so you see problems in P aren't always
easy to tell from those that are
np-complete yet in the real world when
you
a problem it's very important to know
which sort you are dealing with if your
problem is like one of the problems in P
then you know that there should be an
efficient solution and you can avail
yourself of the wisdom of many other
scientists who have thought hard about
how to efficiently solve these problems
on the other hand if your problem is as
hard as one of the np-complete problems
then some caution is in order you can
expect to be able to find exact
solutions for small enough instances and
you may be able to find a polynomial
algorithm that will give you an
approximate solution that is good enough
but you should not expect to find an
exact solution that will scale well
being able to know which situation you
are in is one of the many practical
benefits of studying complexity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
