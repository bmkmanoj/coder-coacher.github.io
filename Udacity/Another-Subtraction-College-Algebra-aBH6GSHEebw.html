before we need to use the distributive
property here to figure out how this
minus sign effects all the terms inside
the second set of parentheses first off
though since nothing is happening
outside of the parentheses on the front
end at least of this first part of your
expression we're just going to rewrite
that without the parentheses and then we
remember the trick that we talked about
before that a minus sign actually means
plus negative 1 times whatever you want
to subtract so instead of the minus sign
right here that's what I'm going to
write we're adding negative 1 times this
entire thing in parentheses and now we
need to use the distributive property to
multiply negative 1 by every term in
here so it's going to affect the 4x
squared and the negative 2x and also the
four so going one step further you'll
notice that for right now I've let there
be an addition sign between all the
terms over here and then there's sign is
being determined within the term before
I change any of these two subtraction
signs if they're going to be them
eventually so now we can carry out this
simplification within each term remember
that if you have two negative numbers
multiplied together they equal a
positive number so negative 1 times
negative 2 is actually equal to positive
2 and now since we have two terms where
I'm adding a negative i'm going to
switch these two negative signs or minus
signs and then last but not least we
rearrange and combine like terms so our
final answer is 3 x squared plus 4x
minus 3 awesome job there are a ton of
steps as you can see in this problem and
there are a lot of places where it's
really easy to make a silly mistake so
that's why it's super important that we
write every single step down I know this
probably feels really tedious but in the
end as you keep practicing getting more
proficient it's going to be the thing
that gives you the right answers so
please just keep taking the time to
write out all of your steps and don't
take any shortcuts quite yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
