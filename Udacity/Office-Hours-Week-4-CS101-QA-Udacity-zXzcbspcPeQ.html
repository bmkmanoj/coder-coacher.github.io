here with andy hi he's the assistant
instructor for Sebastian's class cs3 73
and today I'm going to take the role the
PT usually takes Davis out of town and
Peter will be Dave and i'm going to ask
some questions so let's try to do my
best day of impression I'm sure you can
manage so before we get into content
let's talk a little bit about grading
yes so over the last couple of days we
noticed some bugs and actually the
version of python that we're using that
would miss great assignments that ended
in a comment which is very unfortunate
because common shouldn't affect how the
program runs so we fixed that and going
forward your assignment you submit won't
be affected by that bug and will and
we've also been working to address
submitted code that was copied from an
external editor in drying IDE then had
syntax errors going into it and we're
going to regrade everything once we get
the infrastructure to do so so we're
going to go back all of the faulty
programming assignments will be regraded
and your grade will be changed
accordingly just one point though make
sure that when the assignment of calls
for let's say as function titled search
that you tied at your function search
otherwise when we try to call that
function there's going to be an error
okay yep all right let's move on to
content so first first question is one
that I had actually really yes so I was
going through 101 and I was curious
about latency networks bandwidth and
especially this thing called a packet so
what is a packet okay a packet a packet
is kind of how we transmit data on the
internet and this was a design decision
to address a pretty basic problem so
let's imagine we're sitting in the
Udacity office and Andy is sitting
across from a nice streaming his music
through his headphones and I'm trying to
download a file well over the air he can
only send one thing at a time and so if
you're streaming music constantly and I
just want to download a file I can't do
that at the same time so the solution is
to not download all your file all at
once in one single stream but
get up in chunks and those chunks are
called packets yes okay and so you
download a chunk and then in between
those chunks I can still download my
file make requests goof off on the
internet and whatnot and occasionally
after question get some more done me
yeah man sometimes okay thank you and on
the head of each of those packets is a
header I think you were telling me yeah
so that's how the packets know where to
go it's just they have an address and
its roof it's an IP address you've
probably heard that before all that
stands for internet protocol address
it's just an address it's like an
address when you mail a letter it says
where it's going and if something goes
wrong who is it who to send it back to
and the routers know what to do with
those addresses today just look they
know where it's the same way that a
mailman knows where to go the address
they just no word remember so little
early Milman a little Mammon okay great
okay so first content question from a
user is from splashes and he wants to
know how important as a computer
scientist is it to learn multiple
languages it's not as important as
introductory students might think it
becomes pretty usually you really should
just choose the right language for
whatever you're trying to do different
languages have advantages and
disadvantages if you want your code to
run everywhere Python runs pretty much
everywhere if you if you only are
developing for an iphone then you're
probably just going to need to use the
language i phone you as a subjective c
or some generation of that but yeah it's
a tool okay and so i guess one of the
fears is that will we through learning
python have the tools to learn about
these new tools will we be able to learn
new programming languages yeah a lot of
the transfers because programmers need
to learn new languages so a lot of the
stuff between the languages are very
similar and that's by design and pretty
much all the skills you learn in this
class will apply to almost any
programming language okay Mel Kwan had a
question about using Python code outside
of the interpreter all of our programs
have been run by clicking a run button
but normally when I run a program that's
how I do it looking yeah you go down to
the taskbar and you click the little
picture okay all you do is to get that
picture you run it through another
program that kind of packages this
together and you give it the picture and
then it'll create an installer which you
can then distribute to your users
that'll install it on their machines but
once you click that button it's just
going to your program okay so clicking
the button is like calling a function
that runs my program mm-hmm okay great
thank you so last question for the day
and this is probably a challenging one
for you but I think you're up to the
task I want to know and I think some of
our students want to know what is a
database we've been talking a lot about
data structures so two minutes or less
what's a database humanness are less
that's here that's your target okay this
is a challenge so the way we've been
storing our index is kind of just a big
Python list but that can get unwieldy
after a while every time we want to
update the way we're storing the list we
got to kind of go through and write a
program that changes the structure of
our list and then chain all the change
all our functions to address this new
list format and eventually people got
sick of doing that so you have dedicated
programs that are built for storing and
querying data and that's called a
database okay thank you all right well
that's all the questions for this time
and we well I suppose Peter and Dave
we'll see you next week bye right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
