I'm doing happens to live in this
function called do PCA and it looks very
familiar to a lot of the stuff that
we've done before in scikit-learn you
have an import statement where you
actually get the module out that has the
code that you want you create in this
case the principal components analysis
you fit it and then you can return that
as an object and so what I do is I get
my principal components that analysis
that way and I can ask some very
interesting some very important
questions of it by accessing the
attributes so let's explain these three
lines this is how I actually get the
information out of my pca object the
first the explained variance ratio is
actually where the eigenvalues live so
by printing out this this line here this
is the way that I know that the first
principal component has about 90 91
percent of the variation in the data and
the second one has about nine or ten
percent those numbers come from this
statement here and then the second
things that I do is I look at the first
and second principal components I get
these out of the components attribute of
my pca object so the components is going
to be a list a Python list that has as
many principal components in it as I
asked for as a parameter so in that case
I have two principal components that I'm
getting so I name them the first and
second PC so in previous quizzes where
we were talking about what's the
direction in of say X Prime in the XY
original feature space we came up with
two numbers that were sort of packaged
together into a vector you can access
that directional information through
these components once I fit my principal
components analysis I have to in order
to do anything perform something like a
transformation of the data and this code
I will just give you in the starter code
for the quiz what I'm doing here is I'm
visualizing it the first line is in red
I'll be plotting the first principal
component the locations of all the
points along that principal component as
well as the the direction of the
principal component I'm accessing that
information by using the elements of the
first PC vector then in cyan are kind of
a teal color I'll be accessing the
second principal component and in blue I
have the original data so let me show
you what this looks like
and then you give it a try yourself in
the quiz the first thing you get is i
print out the eigenvalues remember
that's
this explained variance ratio
information and then the second thing is
that you'll get a scatterplot and it
should look something like this so
remember the red was the direction of
our first principal component and that's
hopefully exactly where you guessed it
was certainly intuitively seems like
it's in the right place the cyan is
perpendicular to that and then the blue
is the original data points one thing
that I'll add is that it looks to the
eye like the red and the cyan are not
perfectly orthogonal this doesn't quite
look like a ninety degree angle but
remember that our axes have different
scales that this one goes all the way
out to ten million the y-axis only goes
out to less than half of that about four
million so in reality if we were to plot
everything proportionally this graph
should be twice as long as it is tall
and if we were to visualize it in
exactly that way they would be
orthogonal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
