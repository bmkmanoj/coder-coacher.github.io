analysis and problem reduction let's
revisit one of the problems that we were
encountered when we were talking about
the Ravens test of intelligence so
imagine that this is a and this is B we
can think of this as an initial state
and this is a goal State
we know that a has been transformed into
B now we can think in terms of a
sequence of operations that will
transform this initial state into the
goal state it is one sequence delete the
dot then move the diamond outside the
circle then expanded on it let us now
see we can think of this as an output of
means and analysis because each move
here brings us a little closer to the
goal State the advantage of doing this
analysis and coming up with a sequence
of transformations that will take us
from the initial state to the goal state
is that we cannot think in terms of
applying the same set of transformations
to the image C let's do that
we'll apply one transformation at a time
so we'll apply delete we delete your dot
now we apply move to this state and that
can give rise to several states we have
shown two here both of these states
fulfill the requirements of this move
operation of taking a diamond outside
the circle and now for to each of these
states we can apply the operation of
expand here we expanding the circle here
too we are expanding the circle but
although by different amounts once again
the question here is what in the image a
corresponds to what in image see how do
we know that the diamond inside here
corresponds to the circle inside the
triangle here we will discuss this in
detail when we discuss analogical
reasoning but for now here is a partial
answer remember that we had a semantic
network network representation of the
image a and in that representation we
said that the diamond is inside this
circle now we also have a semantic
Network representation of MHC and that
semantic Network representation says
that the circle is inside the triangle
it is at inside relationship that hints
that this circle must correspond to the
diamond because here the diamond is
inside and here the circle is in
so note then the representation allows
us to answer several questions about
similarity about correspondence and when
we have metal select means and analysis
then we can do a systematic analysis of
these transformations and try to
transfer these set of transformations to
the new problem what's interesting is we
can also see this as an example of
problem reduction we initially just had
a big problem that we had to solve but
here we've reduced it to three sub goals
our first sub goal is to find the
transformation between a and B our
second sub goal is to transfer that
transformation to C and find some
candidate States for D and our third sub
goal would be to compare those candidate
States for D to each of the choices in
our problem as good analysis do it let's
go one step further
this also has generated tests in it we
are generating solutions that we can
then test against the greatest choices
that were given to us so in this
particular problem you can see
means-ends analysis working from
reduction working and generating tests
working often solving a complex problem
requires a combination of AI techniques
at one point one might use problem
reduction at another point one might use
generator and test at a third point one
might use means and analysis notice also
that the one single knowledge
representation of semantic Network
supports all three OD strategies the
coupling between the knowledge
representation of semantic network and
any of these three strategies problem
reduction means and analysis so
generating test is weak later on we'll
come across methods in which knowledge
and the problem-solving method are
closely coupled the knowledge affords
certain inferences and inferences demand
certain kinds of knowledge this is why
these methods are known as weak methods
because the coupling between these
universal methods and the knowledge
representation is weak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
