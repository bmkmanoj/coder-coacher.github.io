installing Xcode so if you haven't yet
pause this video and take a moment to
finish the installation since I already
have Xcode installed I'm ready to launch
the Mays application to launch the app
we need to first launch Xcode and you
can do this by clicking on the spotlight
icon in the top right hand corner of the
screen or optionally you can hit command
and in space and that'll bring up the
same spotlight search and then type
Xcode this will bring up the Xcode
launch screen from the launch screen you
can create new Xcode projects open
existing projects or create a playground
we won't quite be using playgrounds yet
but they're a great tool for
experimenting and writing swift code for
now you'll want to open an existing
Xcode project the Mays project to be
precise we've created the Mays project
ahead of time for you so if you haven't
downloaded it already go ahead and
download it first before continuing
ahead once you've downloaded the project
and saved it somewhere on your computer
select open another project and then you
want to navigate to the project so I've
saved it on my desktop and you want to
open up the Xcode project file and we'll
give it a second to load and here we go
this is Xcode it's a huge application so
we'll start taking it one piece at a
time to run the maze application click
on the play button in the upper
left-hand corner of the Xcode interface
you may also hear this button referred
to as the Run button this will launch
the iOS simulator with the maze app and
there we go congratulations you've
launched your first app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
