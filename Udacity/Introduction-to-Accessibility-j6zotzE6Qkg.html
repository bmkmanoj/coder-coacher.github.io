on the Google Chrome accessibility team
and I'm Rob Dodson a developer advocate
for Chrome we're here to help you
understand how you can make your
websites accessible and usable for
everyone we're also gonna be working
with our friend Mike from Udacity I'm
Mike wills a program manager here at
Udacity I'll be helping you through
exercises so you can make sure your
applications are accessible to everyone
accessibility is a pain to spells so we
often shorten it to a little why but it
doesn't have to be a pain to work on
we'll show you how you can get some easy
wins to help improve accessibility with
minimal effort how you can use what's
built into HTML to create more
accessible and robust interfaces and
some advanced techniques for creating
really polished accessible experiences
you'll also see as we go that a great
deal of this work will help you create
interfaces which are more delightful and
easy to use for really everyone in fact
I think a lot of developers have only a
pretty hazy understanding of what
accessibility means something to do with
government contracts and checklists and
screen readers and there are plenty of
misconceptions floating around like a
lot of developers feel that addressing
accessibility is gonna force them to
choose between creating a delightful and
attractive experience and taking a box
saying that their site is accessible so
what do we mean by accessibility and
really like what are we here to learn
about well broadly speaking when we say
a site to be accessible we're saying
that the site's content should be
available to everyone and functionality
can be operated by anyone literally that
everyone should be able to access it
when it comes to developing sites which
are accessible by everyone though we
need to be a bit more specific as
developers it's easy to fall into the
trap of assuming that all users can see
and use a pointer interface like a mouse
or a touchscreen and experience your
application the same way that you do and
this can lead to creating an experience
which might work well for a narrow range
of people but creates issues for anyone
outside of that range
accessibility in that case refers to the
experience of users who might be outside
of that narrow range and who might
access or experience things differently
to the way the person we feature is a
typical user would specifically it
concerns users who are experiencing some
type of impairment or disability and I
say experiencing there because it makes
absolutely
no difference whether that impairment is
situational temporary or permanent so
with that in mind let's explore what
happens when we actually do take an
inaccessible site and make it more
accessible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
