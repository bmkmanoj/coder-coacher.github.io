people try to come up with trial models
to at least get a glimpse of what's
happening one of these toy models a
particularly interesting one is the
Lorenz system by the way this name is
not to be confused with that of the
physicists who spelled with T Z and this
is what is described by this model
there's a layer of incompressible liquid
between a surface of constant high
temperature and a surface of constant
low temperature we've got some melting
ice cubes here and the velocity field in
that liquid is described by three highly
abstract parameters called x y&amp;amp;z they
describe the relative amount of
different sorts of motion even though
this is a very sketchy and abstract
description some people have succeeded
in implementing these equations with an
actual water wheel the idea about
studying these equations is that they
may be telling us something about every
system in which convection is present
when we plot the solutions of the Lorenz
system in 3d this is what we get a very
intricate butterfly like a ton he were
seeing two solutions one in green and
one in blue starting from almost the
same point something to explore the next
section the trajectories make some turns
on one wing then jump to the other wing
jump back through the first wing and so
on and the number of turns
they take curving seems to be almost
unpredictable and there's one more thing
even though both trajectories have
almost the same starting point you can
see that they quickly diverge in the
course of time we are going to study
that in the next segment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
