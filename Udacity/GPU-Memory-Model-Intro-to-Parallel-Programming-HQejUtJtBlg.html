model let's go back to our diagram and
draw the threads and blocks and kernels
so every thread has access to something
called local memory and this is memory
that's private to that thread things
like its local variables so the thread
can read and write from local memory and
the threads in a thread block also have
access to something called shared memory
so all the threads in this thread block
can read and write to the per block
shared memory it's important understand
that shared memory is shared among the
threads in a block this is a small
amount of memory that sits on the sm
directly and finally there's global
memory every thread in the entire system
at any time can read and write to global
memory so threads and one kernel can
read and write from it threads in a
later kernel can also read and write
from it so every thread to recap has
access to its own local memory has
access to shared memory that's also
accessible to threads and it's
specifically in its thread block and to
global memory which is accessible to all
the threads everywhere of course
everything we've been talking about is
on the GPU that there's also a CPU the
CPU thread launches the work on the GPU
and of course the CPU has access to its
own memory which in CUDA we call hosts
memory usually data is copied to and
from this host memory into the GPUs fast
global memory before launching a kernel
to work on that data we'll talk later
about how CUDA threads can access host
memory directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
