well I actually had a nice little
saturday i decided to hike up mera peak
in the Himalayas um isn't that like the
hardest speak to climb in the world it's
code name is called shark fin and I'm
pretty sure only one team ever
successfully climbed it and they trained
for it like for decades yeah I don't
know anything about that I just know it
was really tall and I wanted to climb it
ok so did you like do any prep before
you ran on this expedition of yours well
I watch this cool documentary on the
mountain but that just served as
motivation what really prepped me for
the trip was the Google elevation API
you see I didn't really know what I was
getting into when I decided to climb
marrow there was this one nagging yet
seemingly important question in the back
of my mind exactly how tall is this peak
so to answer that I turned to the Google
Maps elevation API I simply made a web
service request using the elevation
service I passed in my lat long and my
API key and boom the response told me
that it was over 6,500 meters or 20
1,400 feet tall yeah that's like really
tall that's over four miles of sheer
vertical cliffs to climb so what did you
do next well I decided to stay in bed
order a pizza and check out Mary peak on
Google Earth instead how was your
weekend it was good I stayed home and
watched the movie Dante speak cool let's
get back to work on a real estate app we
had just used geocoding to geolocate and
zoom into an area within the city but
what if a user doesn't have a specific
area that they care about what if they
only care that they're within a
reasonable commute of their office up
next the distance matrix API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
