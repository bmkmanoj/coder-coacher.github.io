there are rules then there are
exceptions to those rules as you're very
well aware of we are allowed to include
style sheets images videos I frames and
even scripts from other origins as well
as then form data to other origins the
end user won't be able to tell that one
image is loaded from our server while
another is loaded from Instagram however
for web developers there is a difference
you can't interact with an image tag
that is showing a cross origin image in
the same way you could with an image
from the same origin for example you
can't inspect the pixels of the image
from inside the canvas element the same
goes for a script tag that includes a
cross origin script resource the
contents will either just silently
appear empty or in case of more modern
AP is it will explicitly throw an error
for the same origin script tag I have
access to its contents but I can't
access the other origin scripts contents
it's important to keep in mind that the
users browser is the one who enforces
the same origin policy it's not the
server but the client that will not let
you send off requests we'll see why this
is important as we look into getting
around same origin policy restrictions
