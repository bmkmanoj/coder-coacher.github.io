with now I love the blue and the
minimalist approach points for guessing
my favorite color but I feel like I
could do a bit more like there aren't
really any animations or magic moments
or anything oh but there's this
notification that'll be handy and really
helps add to the experience although I'd
love to see a widget or something else
to allow me to set up a permanent
weather display that fits with my device
but this doesn't look like what the
weather outside looks like
I wonder how to change that of course it
would be nice if I didn't need to do
this manually
remember that the initial experience is
often the turning point between someone
uninstalling it up and using it every
day now let's see what the tablet
version looks like hmm there's nothing
here what's going on oh I'm not on Wi-Fi
sure would have been nice to know I
needed an internet connection and not
that the app was broken okay much better
and I like the landscape layout with the
weather details right next to the list
really great use of the extra space here
oh Lord looks like there's a few edge
cases they overlooked I mean Wednesday
comes around every week after all it
really is important to keep in mind the
huge variety of Android devices when
designing your app well I'll need to
come up with a plan of attack
I'll check with ian and between the two
of us I'll bet we can settle on the core
of what needs to improve but I challenge
you to take a look at sunshine and make
a short list of what you think should be
done before launching the app discuss
your ideas in the student forum and take
note of where your list intersects with
ours as you move through the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
