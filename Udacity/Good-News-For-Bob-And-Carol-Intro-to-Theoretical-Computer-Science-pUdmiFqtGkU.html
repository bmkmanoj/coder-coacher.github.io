do the following for each of the edges
that is blue over here I will draw in
here and I will color them black and I'm
going to do the same thing over here so
each edge that is blue over here I'm
going to draw in black over here now and
I hope you can you can see it here even
with my drawing that is that is not very
similar it turns out that this graph
over here once I've added all the edges
from this graph is the same as this
graph here once I've added all the edges
from that graph over here and this is
exactly the connection between clique
and independent set if you have solved
click on a given graph you take another
graph will you draw exactly the opposite
edges every pair of vertices that is
connected by an edge in this network is
not connected over here and vice versa
but this means that finding the largest
possible clique in one graph is
basically the same as finding the
largest possible independent set in the
well you can call it an inverse graph
where you've connected exactly those
vertices that were not connected over
here and it's the same the other way
around so if you have found an
independent set in a graph that is as
large as possible then the same vertices
will form a clique if you build the
inverse graph so you connect all of the
vertices that were not connected over
here this is actually great news for Bob
and for Carol because if Bob were to
find a polynomial time algorithm for
clique so if he were to determine that
clique is tractable then independent set
would also be tractable because because
caroled could just take her network
build the inverse Network then have Bob
solve click on that network take that
same solution for her problem Carol
wanted to take independent set what she
would basically do is she would start
out with a graph then she would build
the inverse graph and solve clique that
would give her the same solution as if
he were looking for a independent set on
the original graph and it's the same for
Bob here because if Carol finds a good
algorithm for independent set what he
can do is he can take his graph also
build the inverse graph
and then solve independent set which
means that either both clique and
independent set are tractable or both of
these problems are intractable but it
cannot be the case that only one of them
is tractable or intractable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
