is either very humbling or very
inspiring moment on one hand the laws
that govern the chaos and disorder and
confusion that people see on earth are
the same that covered the motions of the
heavens but looking at it another way
the laws that govern the perfection of
the motion of the heavens are the same
that control the chaos and disorder on
earth it's either very scary or very
beautiful depending on how you look at
it but either way it must have been a
very exciting time in physics now that
we've examined gravity a little bit we
can start to think more about motion so
now we're accepting gravity as a law of
nature all objects are mutually
attracted to one another and so when we
think of a falling Apple we can draw an
arrow which represents the force of
gravity and I've used this subscript G
to indicate that this force is due to
gravity and from Galileo we know exactly
how this object will move it's going to
accelerate downwards at 10 meters per
second squared what's really fascinating
though is that eventually this Apple
will hit the ground and come to rest so
let's think about this Apple this
motionless Apple at rest and think what
does it mean for an object to be
motionless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
