ask one of the most fundamental
questions in theoretical computer
science and that is does P equal NP and
in particular here's what we actually
know this is true we know that every
problem that's in P is in NP and every
problem that's in NP is in X that is to
say any problem that you can solve in
polynomial time we can certainly solve
in non-deterministic polynomial time and
any problem that we can solve a
non-deterministic polynomial time we can
also solve in exponential time but
here's what we don't know it could be
the case that the class NP is actually
equal to the clasp exp that that is to
say the set of problems that we can
solve a non-deterministic polynomial
time might be exactly the same as the
ones that we can solve in exponential
time so there's a sort of outer set and
that's distinct from say this inner set
which is the set of problems that are
solvable in polynomial time oh there's
one other thing that we know we do know
that there really is a difference
between polynomial and exponential time
there are some problems that can be
solved in exponential time that are
definitely not in P so we know those two
things are different but we don't really
know it could be that NP is equal to X
it could also be that P is equal to NP
so the problems that we can solve a
non-deterministic polynomial time might
be exactly the same as the ones that we
can solve in polynomial time
which both would be then different from
exponential time or it could very well
be that there are really three different
categories here that that problems that
are in NP don't necessarily require
exponential time but they may not be
solvable in polynomial time either we
don't know so this question of whether
or not P equals NP whether we're in this
case here is is a pretty heavy question
so what happens if P does equal NP well
a lot of people say a lot of different
things let's turn this into a quiz to
see what you think so one possibility is
that cryptographic protocols so things
for keeping secrets and encrypting data
that are based on problems like
factoring that are in NP could be
cracked another is that there's a whole
lot of computer science to your tissues
who will suddenly be out of work because
they will no longer be having to think
about this problem another possible
outcome might be that with P equal to NP
that means that computers
be smarter than people they'll be able
to solve problems fast that people can't
so I don't know just tell me which one
you think is true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
