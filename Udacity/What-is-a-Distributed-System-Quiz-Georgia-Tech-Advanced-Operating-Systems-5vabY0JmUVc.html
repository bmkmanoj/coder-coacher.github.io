a distributed system and I'm going to
give you three choices it's perfectly
fine if you don't get it right but I
just wanted to get you thinking in terms
of what a distributed system is and what
your understanding is the first choice
says that a distributed system is a
collection of nodes connected by a local
area network or a wide area network
second choice says that a distributed
system is one in which communication
happens only via messages and the third
choice says that a distributed system is
one in which events that are happening
on the same node in like a and B the
time between that is called the event
time and the event that is happening
across nodes which is a communication
event node and one sends a message to
node and truth is a communication event
from A to C so the third choice is
saying that the communication time TM is
much more significantly more than the
event execution time that is the third
choice so you have three choices and I
want you to think about what your
definition what's your mental model of
distributed system is and how any of
these choices fit or do not fit your
mental model of what you think in this
unit system is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
