account you might have a Twitter account
you might have a LinkedIn you probably
have several accounts but across several
different social networking sites and
use them for a lot of different purposes
you might use one to keep up with family
and friends you might use one for job
networking or one to find new media to
consume more and more people are
actually using social networking and
education as well there are teachers in
middle and high school that are using
Facebook in their classroom or using
Facebook to extend their classroom they
figure if my students are on Facebook
every evening anyway why don't I give
them assignment notifications there why
don't I host my discussions on there why
don't I meet my students where they are
and try and bring the educational
experience to them as opposed to
convincing them to come get it from me
but there are others that suggest that
this isn't the best approach that by
trying to integrate education with
something like Facebook or watering down
education and we're trying to too hard
to make education artificially cool and
really we're losing some of the real
value in education so these are some of
the issues that we're going to wrestle
with in this in this lesson we're going
talk about whether or not education and
social networking should actually be
integrating this way should we try and
use Facebook for education should we try
and use Twitter her education or can we
actually build new tools or build new
communities that blur the line between
social networking and education while
also preserving some of that sanctity or
some of that rigor of an educational
environment things like Edmodo that are
custom built for education but also have
a lot of social networking type features
in them so talk a lot about these
different tools and these different
questions that are available in the
community during this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
