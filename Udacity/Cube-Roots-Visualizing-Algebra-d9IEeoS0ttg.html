actually take the cube root of the
volume so the cube root of eight would
be the cube root of two cubed we need
this factor of two to appear three times
in order for us to take it out since
this index is a three we need a group of
the three factors to take out the two
from the radical symbol a cube root
really just undoes a third power we can
think of roots and powers as inverse
operations of one another pretty neat
huh we can apply the same concept for
taking the cube root of 125 we see that
a factor of five appears three times
that are need the radical so we just
have five and for the cube root of 343
we just have seven here's the list of
some perfect cubes these numbers are
considered to be perfect cubes since we
can take the cube root of them to get an
integer like we saw before eight was the
same thing as 2 cubed so the cubed root
of 8 or 2 cubed is just too you'll want
to keep a list of these perfect squares
and perfect cubes close by since they
come up frequently make a list on a
separate sheet of paper or use an index
card but either way you want to be
really comfortable with your perfect
squares and perfect cubes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
