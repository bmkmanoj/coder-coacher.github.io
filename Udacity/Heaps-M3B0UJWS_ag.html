with some of its own additional rules in
a heap elements are arranged in
increasing or decreasing order such that
the root element is either the maximum
or minimum value in the tree there are
two different types of heaps max heaps
and min heaps that capture those two
situations in a max heap a parent must
always have a greater value than its
child so the root ends up being the
biggest element the opposite is true of
min heaps a parent has a lower value
than its child so the root is the
minimum element heaps don't need to be
binary trees so parents can have any
number of children operations like
search insert and delete can vary a lot
based on the type of heap we're
discussing here I'm going to focus on a
max binary heap so we're going to keep
the two children rule and the root will
be the maximum element in addition a
binary heap must be a complete tree
meaning all levels except the last one
are completely full if the last level
isn't totally full values are added from
left to right the rightmost leaf will be
updated until the whole row has been
filled in this heap a function that gets
the maximum value also called peak
happens in constant time all right let's
see what search looks like should we
start our search by going to the left or
the right in a BST we knew which
direction to go at each step by doing
comparisons here there's no guarantee
either way thus searching ends up being
a linear time operation since normally
we can't rely on tricks and we'll end up
searching the entire tree one thing to
note is that we can actually use the max
heap properties to our advantage in a
search for example we can quit our
search immediately if the element we're
searching for is bigger than the root in
general if our node value is bigger than
the one we're comparing to we don't need
to check anything in its subtree since
we know that it's the biggest the worst
case remains but in the average case we
don't actually need to search every
element the average case is closer to n
over two but that's still approximated
to
near time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
