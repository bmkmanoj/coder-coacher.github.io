we want our powers of two x and y to be
divisible by three this means we want to
have two cubed x to the sixth and y to
the ninth we need to up these powers so
that way they're divisible by three so
to change to to the one to two to the
three we multiplied by the cube root of
two squared this means we have to
multiply by the cube root of two squared
X to the 1 y squared this is so that way
the powers some to multiples of three
we'll have 2 to the 1 and 2 squared
which is 2 to the third X to the fifth
and X to the 1 which is X to the 6 and y
to the seventh times y squared which is
y to the ninth since we multiply our
denominator by this expression we
multiply our numerator by the same
expression now we want to simplify our
numerator stays the same since we can't
pull out in these factors since they
don't appear three times this
denominator simplifies to 2 x squared
and why did the third remember we're
just applying power / route to get each
of these powers and we can actually
simplify further the six and the two
reduced a 3/1 and this power of x
reduces with one of the powers in the
denominator in other words we'll have
one more power of x in the denominator
than we would in our numerator this
leaves us with our simplified answer now
the hardest part of this problem is
understanding what to multiply by here I
think if you start by figuring out what
your denominator should look like you'll
get there more quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
