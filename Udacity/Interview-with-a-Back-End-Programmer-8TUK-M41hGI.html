full-stack engineer at Udacity when I
say I'm a full-stack engineer it kind of
means I do a little bit of the both
right I kind of do some front end and
back end my background when I first
started out programming I was doing
hardcore computer science and I kind of
got interested in thinking about the
user more so looking at aspects of
psychology you know thinking about how
people learn and how people think about
you know the systems that they using and
really was interested in building
interfaces that worked well for people
and the more projects that I did the
more I found myself kind of floating to
that role within my team you know being
the guy who put together the system that
everything was talking to and actually
since coming to Udacity my sweet spot is
really thinking about how to build the
systems that power the front ends the
front end is is is cool because it
exists right in the moment that
someone's using it's right just on their
screen but the back end sort of covers
everybody who's using a big system at
the same time and so it's really kind of
fun to build the sort of larger piece
that's that's kind of underpinning
everything and thinking about some of
the unique problems that come up there
one of the back end pieces that I'm
working on right now is what's going to
be the foundation of the next iteration
of the audacity platform and so we're
migrating from what was kind of a
monolithic application on top of Google
App Engine into a network of micro
services and so putting all the be
back-end underpinnings in place before
we can even think about building out the
interfaces with the backend you really
want to take that step back and think
critically about you know is this going
to slowly eat up all my memory and
destroy my server is this going to
create a security hole that you know
somebody might be able to you know use
to get information they shouldn't or you
know is this going to be a performance
bottleneck that'll screw everything else
up and so yeah there's a little more
kind of structured thinking I think that
goes into that if you've got a problem
with a front-end system and you're
debugging it you know in your machine in
front of you you can put a breakpoint in
you can stop it in the middle you can
just kind of poke in and see what's
happening
and going to figure out on a very
detailed level what the issues are but
with the production system you can't
really just stop it and and go with that
you want it to keep serving and keep
running keep you know possibly working
for all the other people who are using
it and so some of the tools that I'll
employ I mean first off there's logs you
know that's number one hands down the
way you're going to look at any problem
just look back to the logs and see did
the usual thing happen or did was an
error thrown somewhere along the way but
it sometimes the logs still look fine
and it doesn't help you any all it says
is maybe it's really slow maybe this
step took ten minutes and you don't
really know why it definitely takes
putting on your detective hat sometimes
and in thinking really carefully about
you know what the code is doing under
the hood it's not like you get direct
access all the time sometimes you have
to be a little indirect about you know
poking at it from outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
