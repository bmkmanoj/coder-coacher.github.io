fragment shader in a program since
that's where all the per pixel
processing is happening let's back up a
bit and show how various parameters were
produced by the vertex shader the
position and normal of the vertex are
passed in with these names position and
normal a few built-in matrices are used
for transformation namely projection
matrix modelview matrix and normal
matrix in 3gs these are always available
to the shader if desired in WebGL itself
you need to do a little more work
there's currently not a Model View
projection matrix of these two matrices
multiplied together maybe you'll be the
person to add it to 3gs as it's commonly
used and would be more efficient to use
here what we get out of this shader are
a few vectors first the GL position is
set which is location and click
coordinates this vector must always be
set by the vertex shader at a minimum
one of the features of the vertex shader
is that you can change the shape of an
object you can't really change it in the
fragment shader the normal in Model View
space is computed here using the normal
transform matrix finally a vector from
the location and Model View space toward
the viewer is computed first the
position in Model View space is computed
and then negating this vector gives the
direction toward the viewer from the
surface instead of from the viewer to
object remember that the cameras at the
origin and view space we don't really
need the temporary MV position vector we
could have combined these last two lines
of code this example is here to show how
to compute it to sum up the vertex
shader took as inputs the model space
position and normal it transformed them
to create a point in clip coordinates
for the rasterizer it also transformed
the normal in position the resulting
transform vertices are then interpolated
across the triangle during rasterization
and sent to the fragment shader for each
fragment produced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
