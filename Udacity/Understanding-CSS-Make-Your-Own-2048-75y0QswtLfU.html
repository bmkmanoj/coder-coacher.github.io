HTML can you do something similar tell
me how you think about reading a CSS
file alright sure let's go look at it
alright so we've got the CSS file so CSS
stands for cascading style sheets the
cascading part is sort of you can define
things in multiple different ways and
it'll always be the last definition that
that gets used okay that's things yeah
so we've got HTML and body so all of
these rules will be applied to any
element that starts with HTML or body
and then this rule will apply just to
the ones with body and you'll notice
it's one of the same attributes between
the two of them so so this margin is
going to supersede that one it's
important yeah it'll override it okay
cool okay so and this could say div for
example this could yes there's any HTML
thing yeah so you could define styles
for all divs that would be kind of weird
because there are so many dudes that's
it would just be kind of kind of strange
but so here we've got inputs
those are like boxes that you type stuff
in so now this is different this is
green yeah so this guy is talking about
a class okay so these other ones where
they don't have dots in front of them
those are the main element themselves so
the thing right after the open angle
bracket when it's got a dot it's talking
about the part that says class equals so
this one is referring to this particular
class any class okay mm-hmm and then
here we've got an element dot class name
so it's only that kind of elements class
name so if if we'd had a div with a with
the class title this rule wouldn't be
applied to it okay it's only gonna be
applied to heading ones so what about
these so what's going on with these like
at - WebKit - keyframes what is this
this looks like it's probably some kind
of animation or like it may be a hover
over something okay whatever WebKit and
Moz what are those things mean yeah so
this is clearly referring to different
kinds of browsers so it's probably like
different ways of doing things based on
which browser you're in oh so is this so
when our front-end engineers are all
complaining about you know lack of
browser specification they're complain
about having to write these things yeah
or we're probably more like this sort of
thing okay I can see where they'll get
annoying yeah I think renewing and is
that about it I mean there's elements
we've got classes we've got this blue
stuff which is just the rules you're
applying the font size the height is
that about all that's going on yeah
pretty much I mean you you can do more
complicated stuff in CSS but it's sort
of preferable not to you mostly want the
CSS file to be as simple as possible and
just sort of give the basic positioning
and like coloring and all of that and
then have the JavaScript deal with
everything else okay all right well I'm
gonna actually try and do that thing
that you said I shouldn't do and try and
change some of the styling of all the
divs and see if that does anything
interesting all right okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
