freedom it can rotate around its pivot
point however the motion along this axis
is fairly complex and is difficult to
capture in a few simple equations one
brute force method to create animations
is called motion capture the idea is to
capture the movements of a person or
object by using a few strategically
placed cameras the information recorded
is processed to derive the paths of
various parts of the body these motions
are then applied to the model in the
virtual world to more easily track where
each part of the body goes it's coming
to attach ping-pong balls or lights to a
person while filming them these attached
objects are called markers there's a
move towards marcola systems where no
special suits are needed in the
foreground here you can see the actors
pose being captured and applied to a
character in this clip there's a lot
going on you might want to watch it a
few times in the upper-right the two
actresses are being recorded the
cameraman is also moving around the
scene in the lower right you can see the
reconstruction of the actresses motions
on the left these motions are being
applied to the two computer animation
characters in real time there are two
views here on the left on the one half
is the camera man's view the other half
shows a fixed camera view of the whole
scene motion capture is used extensively
in the film and games industry as it's a
straightforward way to quickly generate
animations and is cost effective there
are some drawbacks the first is cost of
entry this process is currently not
something you can easily do without some
investment that said costs are coming
down and inexpensive hardware such as
Microsoft's Kinect can be used for
capture you can also use more limited
forms of capture this demo by Jerome at
the end does head tracking using a
webcam it's using 3gs and is free source
so it's something you can instantly use
yourself motion capture can only do so
much systems that use markers can track
only those markers for example hand and
finger gestures will not be caught by a
full body capture system motion tracking
is also affected by the limitations of
the actors in the world itself there are
real-world constraints on real-world
performances and the data is only as
good as your actors can provide artists
generating animation have unlimited
freedom at least until they run out of
time or money to get back to our humble
drinking bird the way this process could
work is that we track the motion over
time the positions tracked could be
turned into the amount of rotation of
the z-axis for the birds moving part we
would then have a giant table of values
which we could interpolate between at
some given time T the angle of
asian is Z apply this rotation at that
time and we have an animation matching
real life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
