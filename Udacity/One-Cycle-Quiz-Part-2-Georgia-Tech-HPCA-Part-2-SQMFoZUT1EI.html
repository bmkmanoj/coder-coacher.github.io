are all the things that happen in one
cycle in tomasulo's algorithm suppose
that this is the situation we have at
the beginning of a cycle we have an
instruction that is waiting to be issued
in the instruction queue this is the
contents of the rat these are the values
for the registers these are the
reservation stations two of them are
occupied one is still available and the
instruction in reservation station zero
is executing in the Lu and during this
cycle it will broadcast its result which
is 4.4 this is what is allowed to happen
in the same cycle issuing and then
dispatching the instruction cannot
happen in the same cycle capturing a
result and then dispatching can happen
in this particular processor and then
issuing and broadcasting of a result for
the same rat entry is of course also
allowed the first part of this quiz is
at the end of the cycle whose beginning
we are looking at here what will be the
content of the two rat entries and the
two registers so after the end of this
cycle what's going to be here here here
and here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
