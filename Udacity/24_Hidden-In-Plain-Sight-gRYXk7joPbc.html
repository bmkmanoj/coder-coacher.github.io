tuning the experience for assistive
technology users involved ensuring that
only the relevant parts of the page are
exposed to assistive technology there
are several ways to ensure that a
section of the Dom does not get exposed
to accessibility api's or is exposed
only to accessibility api's firstly
anything which is explicitly kidding
will also not be included in the
accessibility tree so anything which has
a visibility hidden or display none CSS
style all uses the html5 hidden
attribute will also be hidden from
assistive technology uses however an
element which is not visually rendered
but not explicitly hidden is still
included in the accessibility tree one
common technique is to include screen
reader only text in an element which is
absolutely positioned far off screen all
those we have seen it's also possible to
provide screen reader only text via an
aria-label attribute or an aria labeled
by or ra described by attribute
referencing an element which is
otherwise hidden the instructor notes
have a link to some more information on
providing screen reader only text
finally ra provides a mechanism for
excluding content for assistive
technology which is not visually hidden
in the form of an RA hidden attribute
applying this attribute to an element
effectively removes it and all of its
descendants from the accessibility tree
with the exception of any element which
is referred to via an RA labeled by o ra
described by attribute for example in an
online slide deck you might need to have
next and previous slides pre-rendered
and ready to slide in but not make them
visible to users who are viewing the
deck by assistive technology until
they're all the way on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
