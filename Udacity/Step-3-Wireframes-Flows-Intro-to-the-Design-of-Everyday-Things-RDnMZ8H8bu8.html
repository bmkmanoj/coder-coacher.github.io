steps of what is called low fidelity
prototyping this is where we take paper
to make simple representations of our
designs we create paper prototypes for
communication and to demonstrate our
ideas and to find out what works for a
user we don't want to invest too much
into it
sketching is cheap and engineering is
expensive you said the word wireframes
can you I've heard that word a lot can
you explain what that is well actually
Clifton has a great example of a
wireframe a wireframe shows the basic
information and placement of different
elements so he's got a little token here
that kind of represents that image you
know and I think that's become so
familiar to us that we know that that's
like a picture of somebody even though
it doesn't look like anybody I know
in fact it looks kinda like a question
mark with a little hump and then this is
text that's placement for text and he's
put it within this frame which is
actually very similar to this frame
right of our device so and then he's got
some call-outs and labels so this
essentially is wireframes but all these
wireframes and the only difference say
between his wireframes of yours is that
he's constrained them by a frame he sort
of put that around and he's thought a
little bit about how things are
positioned within this constraint so
he's already one step ahead which is
fine wire frames show placement in an
actual frame of a device and flows are
sequences of wireframes flows work to
create a user interface story in much
the same way as a comic strip tells the
story now let's actually make some
wireframes and flows using those
conceptual models that we made earlier
in fact let's bring all the elements you
generated before including the
conceptual models the discoverable
signifiers and the feedback into our
wireframes and storyboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
