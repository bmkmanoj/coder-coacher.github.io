vector multiply spin v SP MV noting that
this is one of the most important
operations in all of computing what
we're going to look at today is how to
implement this efficiently so first a
quick recap on what spin V is we wish to
multiply a matrix by a vector if this
matrix is dense where every entry in the
entire matrix is represented in the
matrix data structure GPUs can get
excellent performance but many
interesting matrices are what we call
sparse many if not most of the entries
in these matrices are 0 so we prefer to
represent only the non zeros in this
matrix which gives us two advantages one
less storage since we don't have to
represent a bunch of zeros and two less
computation since we're not doing a
bunch of multiplications and additions
of zeros if you need a refresher on how
to multiply a sparse matrix by a dense
vector please take a short trip back to
unit 4 because what we're going to talk
about today is a strategy to build a
more efficient spin V the broad question
that we want to answer in thinking about
how to map this problem efficiently is
what is the role of a thread let's look
at this sparse matrix to answer this
question here we're using X's to
represent non zeros and blanks to
represent zeros we will consider two
alternatives the first is that we will
assign one thread per row of the sparse
matrix here a thread is responsible for
computing one entry in the output vector
and we do this by taking the dot product
of this row with this column second we
will assign one thread per element in
the sparse matrix for instance this
element here here a thread is
responsible for doing one multiplication
in this case times its corresponding
element in the input vector what we call
a partial product and then cooperating
with other threads this thread for
instance in summing up the partial
products so which is better
the answer is it depends and we'll look
at how to do both of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
