shuffle routine both the one that we
wrote and the random Dutch shuffle from
the standard Python library returned
none that is they don't return a useful
value they just return nothing and the
idea of the shuffle routine is that they
modify the input so there's an eternal
tension in programming between computing
a result and doing something so
functions functions like square root and
sign function and so on take an input
and return a result they don't modify
the input they can they create a new
value as a result but functions or
subroutines or methods like shuffle are
different they take an input and modify
that input they take the state of the
world and do something to the state of
the world rather than just compute a
result we we talk of these functions
that compute a result has pure functions
and these that do something is impure
and I like to talk of them as
subroutines rather than functions
because they aren't functions in the
mathematical sense they have an effect
on the world now you'll see that most of
the code that I show in this class is of
the computing type rather than the doing
type and the main reason for this is
that the computing code is easier to
test so if I wanted to write a test for
a computing function for a pure function
I can do something like assert sorted of
the list three to one equals one two
three a single line and I'm done on the
other hand if I want to test a
subroutine that does something that
affects the state of the world I have to
first set up some state so let's say
input equals three to one
then I have to call the subroutine or
method say input dot sort and then I
have to inspect the state to see what
happened so I would assert that input is
now equal to
oops let's make sure we have double
equal signs their input is now equal to
one two three so in this case there's
not that much difference so we have a
library method sort and built-in
function sorted and with the built-in
function it's a single line to test with
the doing subroutine it's three lines to
test but in general as we add more state
and we have functions that do rather
than compute it's going to be more work
to set up the state invoke the method
and then test it and it's easier to do
the test for pure functions and that's
why I prefer them when they make sense
and stick to the doing approach only
when necessary when there's a lot of
state that we have to deal with then we
go ahead and write methods or
subroutines that modify the state rather
than write pure functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
