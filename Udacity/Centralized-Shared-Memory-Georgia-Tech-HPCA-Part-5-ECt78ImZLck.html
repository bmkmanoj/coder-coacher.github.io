of multiprocessors the first type of
multiprocessor uses what is called a
centralized shared memory so all the
cores let's say we have four of them
might have their own caches but then
they are all connected to the same bus
so they can all access the same main
memory and input/output devices this
course can share data by simply reading
and writing the main memory assuming of
course that these reads and writes go
through the caches properly and we will
see that we can achieve that so pretty
much this score can send data to disk or
by writing to some memory location and
then this score reads it from there
similarly any of the cores can access
any of the i/o devices here this type of
a system is really what today's
multi-core processors tend to look like
and is also called yuma which stands for
uniform memory access time but it's not
you Matt it's just Yuma but what is
uniform is really the time to access the
memory why well because this main memory
is at the same long distance from all of
the cores yes it can be slightly closer
to some of them but because they're all
connected to it in the same way the
memory really is about as bad to access
as any one of them this type of
multi-processing is also called SMP
which stands for symmetric
multiprocessor it's called symmetric
because any core and its cache look just
like any other core and its cache in the
system so if we had two cores we can
just take one of them with its caches
and replicate to make a four core system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
