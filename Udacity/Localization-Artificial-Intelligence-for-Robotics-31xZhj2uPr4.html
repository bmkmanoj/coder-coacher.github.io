solve is called localization and
involves a robot that's lost in space it
could be a car it could be a mobile
robot
so here's vironment and the poor robot
has no clue where it is similarly we
might have a car driving on a highway
and this car would like to know where it
is is inside the lane or is it crossing
lane markers now the traditional way to
solve this problem uses satellites and
these satellites emit signals that the
car can perceive let's known as GPS
short for Global Positioning System and
it's what you have in your dashboard if
you have a car with GPS that shows you
the maps and shows you where you are now
unfortunately the problem with GPS is
it's really not very accurate it's
really common for a car to believe to be
here but it has to all the way up to 10
meters of error so if we try to stay in
the lane with 10 meters of error you are
far off and you're driving right over
here and you crash so for our
self-driving cars to be able to stay in
lanes using localization we need
something like 2 to 10 centimetres of
error and then we can drive with GPS in
lanes so the question is how can we know
where we are
with 10 centimeter accuracy let's the
localization question in the Google
self-driving car localization plays a
key role we record images of the road
surface and then use the techniques I'm
just about to teach you to find out
exactly where the robot is and it does
so with a few centimeter accuracy and
that makes it possible to stay inside
the lane even if the lane markers are
missing so localization is a lot of math
but before I dive into mathematical
detail I want to give you an intuition
for the basic principles I'm going to
tell you the story of how over localizes
and then we can go through the math
together so you can understand it I also
want to let you program your own
localizer
so you can program a self-driving car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
