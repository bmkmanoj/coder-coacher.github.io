of the support vector machine so let's
recap what have we learned
well we learned that support vector
machine is not a command or a political
statement we talked about how a margin
is a useful concept in trying to
understand how well a linear classifier
might generalize okay I like let me
write that down
margins are important so we learned
about margins in particular their
relation to generalization and
overfitting okay in particular we would
like given the choice to find a linear
separator that has the largest margin
right right so maximizing margins right
at least when it comes to margins bigger
is better then we talked about how you
could actually find a linear separator
that has maximum margin I think we
turned it into a quadratic program yes
we found an optimization problem for
finding maximum margins and they turned
out to be quadratic programming and it
was the dual of the quadratic program
that showed us how what the support
vectors were the support vectors were
the points from the input data that were
necessary for defining that maximum
margin separator right right so we
actually figured out what support
vectors were and we tied all that into
instance based learning and other kind
of ensemble methods and so you can sort
of think of support vector machines as
being eager lazy learners or only as
lazy as necessary to represent what you
needed to represent because the
classifier was based on just a subset of
the data or the raw data was being used
for defining the classifier exactly
right all right so there's anything else
oh right then there was the whole idea
that well linear doesn't always seem
like enough but we can project data into
a higher dimensional space and do the
comparisons there and that only made one
little change to the algorithm in
particular the dot product could be
turned into some other similarity metric
and you call that the kernel trick right
I love the kernel trick and as you say
we took basically X transpose Y and
generalized it to a generic similarity
function
k of X comma Y and that actually ended
up representing all of our domain
knowledge which will come up again and
again throughout this course what are
the levers we have for expressing domain
knowledge okay so anything else weird
writing down Michael I think you said
that kernels had to satisfy the merciful
condition no no no the Mercer condition
oh okay well that makes more sense that
the mercial condition is interestingly
quite merciful because it's okay to use
kernels that don't necessarily satisfy
the Mercer conditions often in practice
it still works okay well good I think
that's mostly it so I guess we're done
wait a second didn't you say that you
were going to explain boosting to us you
kind of suggested maybe you do that
during the boosting lecture but then you
said it would be during the SVM lecture
and now the SVM lectures over and we
still don't know why boosting doesn't
over fit oh that's a good point that's a
good point I forgot about that
thank you Michael this is why I keep you
around to remind me about stuff like
this okay let me take a moment then just
a moment to see if we can tie together
overfitting and boosting with what we
just learned about SVM's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
