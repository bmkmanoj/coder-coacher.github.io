development I'm going to start you out
with something we call control flow one
way to control the flow of code in our
app is with an if statement and Swift if
statements are easy to use and
understand with a minimal amount of code
to type here's how it works it starts
with a keyword if and then a statement
that you expect to be true following by
opening curly braces the closing curly
braces finish off the if inside the if
statement you can put the code that you
want to run if that statement evaluates
to true some say change is the only
constant thing in life what if we want
to run some code if the statement is not
true enter the else clause right after
the closing curly brace of the if we add
the keyword else and another set of
curly braces in there we have code we
want to run if the statement evaluates
to false there are other types of
control flows in Swift including a very
powerful switch statement that we will
cover later on in this nanodegree in
fact we even have an elective course
called Swift syntax that takes you into
all the ins and outs of the Swift
language now let's move on to Xcode in
Xcode open the quiz view controller dot
Swift file in project zero have pulled
out most of the code into something we
call a class extension just so you can
focus on the few lines of code you need
to write scroll down until you see the
ad I be action funk flag button pressed
function this function is called when
the user presses one of the three flag
buttons we need to see if the user
pressed the correct button and then
display a message to them how to do this
an if statement will work great the
variable that this function is given one
called is named sender by the way you
will hear people use the phrase passed
in it just means the variable sent to a
function when it is called sender is an
object representing the button pressed
by the user all buttons have an
integer tag and we have also stored the
correct tag under the variable called
correct button tag so let me walk you
through this we know the correct tag is
stored under a variable called correct
button tag we know we just got passed an
object corresponding to the button that
was pressed as a parameter to this
function called sender so we need to
check if the tag of the button that is
past is the same as the correct button
tag in other words we need to check
whether the user pressed the right
button and pick the correct language
here is the if statement that you need
to add to this the double equals is a
comparison checking to see if the past
in buttons tag is the same as a correct
button tag if it is great tell the user
they chose the correct answer if the tag
integer values do not line up the answer
was incorrect and we should inform the
user as well with this if statement
added we should be able to run the app
and see what happens when we choose an
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
