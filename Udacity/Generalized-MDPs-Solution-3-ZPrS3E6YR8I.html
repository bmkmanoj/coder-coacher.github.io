expectation again which I like and now
we're going to do minna max and what you
said before we started going to the quiz
is that you know you're kind of treating
this is sort of a joint action space so
it's sort of you taking an action and
then you're let's say opponent taking an
action and so on and so forth and so
really I don't know what I would call
this but it looks a lot like just
regular old game search when you have
you know zero-sum game yes zero-sum game
that's exactly what I would call it and
we're going to talk a lot more about
variations of algorithms that that act
like this that deal with the case when
there's multiple agents but this was
sort of a nice setting to bring it up
because the basic result says that if
we're if we've got a generalized mdp
we've got this operator and this
operator defined in such a way that it's
a non expansion and turns out all these
things minimax this rank ordered rank
weighted idea max the the linear
combination you know expectation min all
these things are all non expansions so
all these things value iteration will do
something reasonable it'll actually come
out with a fixed point in the limit so
actually man max all of these things and
Ord roll-aboard they're all convex some
so it doesn't mean that all convex
combinations are nonexpansive so that's
a great question they are all convex
combinations that's true it is not the
case that arbitrary convex combinations
result in non expansions in particular
if the weights of the convex combination
depend on the values the actual
magnitude of the values in some way then
we need not get anything that is a non
expansion okay that's good to know yeah
yeah and that actually comes up in a
really important setting which is if
you're doing not say epsilon greedy
exploration which corresponds to the
third line here but instead we're doing
something like Boltzmann exploration we
could run into trouble all right so I
think that's it for this kind of
introduction to generalize mbps and I
think that actually finishes the section
on convergence so you ready for some
recap yes I love recapping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
