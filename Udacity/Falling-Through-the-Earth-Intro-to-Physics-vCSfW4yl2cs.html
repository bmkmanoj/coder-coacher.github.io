summer you're feeling particularly
adventurous and you dig a hole straight
through the center of the earth and by
some miracle you don't end up roasting
yourself in the Earth's core or anything
like that you managed to dig all the way
through the together side of the earth
and to celebrate the completion of your
big summer project you decide to leap
dramatically into your tunnel to head
towards the other side of the earth now
it turns out if you were to do this it
would actually oscillate back and forth
between the surf Earth's surface on this
side and the Earth's surface on this
side and lo and behold and turns out
that this motion through the Earth's
core is actually simple harmonic motion
to see why this is simple harmonic
motion we're going to have to
investigate what gravity is like within
the earth we know what it's like above
the earth but what is it like inside of
the earth it turns out that the force of
gravity within the Earth's surface is
equal to little G times your mass
divided by the radius of the earth and
then times your current radius so your
distance away from the center of the
earth which I'm calling R here now it's
possible to derive this equation from
scratch but the derivation is quite
complicated so I'm not going to do it
here but you should discuss that on the
forums so the key thing we see about
this equation is that the force grows
proportionally with the distance away
from the center of the earth and where
have we seen this before
well it looks exactly like Hookes law
which says that the force a spring poles
on an object is equal to the spring
constant times its displacement away
from the center so this equation for the
force of a spring looks just like this
equation for the force of gravity within
the Earth's surface except instead of X
we use R instead of K we have GM over
the radius of the earth okay now that
you know how gravity scales within the
earth I want you to tell me what's the
period of this simple harmonic motion so
how long does it take for you to return
to your original starting point once you
jump in the earth completing one
complete cycle here and put your answer
in minutes and for this problem you
should use 10 meters per second squared
for little G and you should use 6,400
kilometers for the radius of the earth
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
