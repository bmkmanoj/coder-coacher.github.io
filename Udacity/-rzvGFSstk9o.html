movie that we have written thus far now
bear in mind that you may have to go
into full-screen mode in order to see
all of the details here properly and I'm
really curious to figure out what
happens behind the scenes when I run
this line of code what happens when I
create an instance called Toy Story by
providing these four pieces of
information on arguments these pieces of
information are the name of the movie
its storyline the link to its poster and
the link to its YouTube URL now clearly
the last two of these are not really
links or URLs just yet they are English
phrases and I did that because there
wasn't enough space on the screen for me
to add the full links or the URLs to the
poster and the YouTube trailer so the
first thing that happens when we run
this line of code is that the init
function gets called and the init
function you will recall is the function
we defined inside class movie self in
that case is itself or the instance
being created which is Toy Story the
next argument is movie title whose value
is Toy Story movie storyline gets the
value toys come to life the variable
poster image gets the right value and
finally the trailer YouTube variable
gets the correct link okay so far so
good now once in it gets called and all
of these arguments receive their correct
values all of the variables that are
associated with the instance Toy Story
they get initialized appropriately and
these variables you may notice our title
storyline poster image URL and trailer
YouTube URL at this point if I try to
print out Toy Story storyline it prints
out the correct value all right now that
we know exactly what happens when we
create this instance Toy Story let's go
back to our design and find out what we
have to do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
