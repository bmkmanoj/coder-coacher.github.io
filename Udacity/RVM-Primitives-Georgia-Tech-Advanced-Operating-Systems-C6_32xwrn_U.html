provided by reliable virtual memory for
the app developer recall what I said
earlier and that is we do not want the
in-memory data structures when modified
to immediately start writing to the
corresponding on disk version in the
external data segments because that
would result in a lot of random writes
and therefore we suggested that what we
want to do is use a log segment to
aggregate changes that we are making to
the portions of the virtual address
space so that the log segment can then
be committed to the disk to record the
changes that we're making to the virtual
memory and so the first set of
primitives that our VM provides is
initialization and in particular this
initialize primitive identifies the log
segment to be used by the server process
for recording changes to the persistent
data structures of this process and
every process can declare its own log
segment data structure for use in
managing its persistence so if I have a
file system it has its own data
structures because remember that our VM
is not inside the operating system but
our VM is provided as a runtime library
in support of applications that live on
top of the operating system so the
library provides these primitives and so
initialised is allowing the process that
is using this library to declare a log
segment data structure which will be the
data structure into which our VM in the
course of execution of the process will
aggregate changes that this process is
making to persistent data structures so
that later on those changes in the log
segment can be committed to the disk and
even further those changes can
eventually be reflected in the data
segments that those in-memory versions
of persistent data structures represent
the map primitive is the primitive that
allows the application to say what is
the region of the virtual address space
that I want map to an external data
segment I mentioned that there is a one
to one correspondence
between an address range in the virtual
address space and the external data
segments so if I need to map different
portions of the address space of the
process to different data segments I
would execute multiple map calls to map
different regions of my virtual address
space the different external data
segments so this region descriptor
contains both the address range that I
want to be mapped as well as it names
the external data segment that
corresponds to this particular address
range a none map
thus the reverse namely it decouples the
address range from the external data
segment that it was associated with up
until now so in the body of the server
code these are the calls that an app
developer would make the begin
transaction and end transaction alerts
the RVM runtime that the application is
about to make changes to persistent data
structures between these begin and end
transaction calls to the RVM library and
in fact signals to the RVM library that
the transaction has committed meaning
that all the changes that the
application made in between begin and
end two data structures that are
persistent have to be flushed to the
disk that is they have to be made
persistent on the other hand a begin
transaction could also end in an abort
transaction which essentially signals to
the RVM library that all the changes
that the application made bound between
begin transaction and abort transaction
have to be thrown away by the RVM
library and should not be committed to
the disk that is they should not be
persisted so the idea then is between
begin transaction and end transaction
the application developer is modifying
the in-memory version of the persistent
data structures and committing them to
the persistent storage by calling this
end transaction which is saying commit
my changes to the in-memory versions to
the persistent version on the desk on
the other hand if the developer calls an
abort
after a begin transaction then all the
changes that he or she made to
persistent data structures should be
thrown away by the RVM library and not
persisted on the desk the set range call
is the very first thing that an app
developer would do inside a begin
transaction end transaction sequence you
can think of this code between begin
transaction and end transaction like a
critical section of the app developers
codebase and the first thing that
happens within the critical section is a
call to set range what the set range is
saying is even though an address region
may be mapped to an external data
segments in this particular critical
section bound by begin and end
transaction I'm going to modify only a
portion of that address range and that
portion of the address range that I'm
going to modify is specified by the
starting address and the size of that
block that I'm going to modify that's
the purpose of the set range call which
says for this particular transaction
which is started here for which our VM
will return a unique transaction ID to
me when I make this call I'm going to
use this transaction ID and tell our VM
that for this particular transaction I'm
going to modify only a block of memory
starting at this address and bound by
this address that's the purpose of the
set range call so it is only this
portion of it that we're going to modify
and we will see how all of what I said
is used by the RVM library in its
implementation in a minute but from the
users point of view from the developer's
point of view this is all that the
developer needs to know and use in order
to write as application that has
persistent data structures as simple as
that all the heavy lifting that is
needed to accomplish the developer's
intent for persistence that are
enshrined in these primitives is taken
care of by the RVM runtime which we will
see in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
