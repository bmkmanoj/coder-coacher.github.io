famous paper on computable numbers he
not only created the Turing machine but
at a number of other major insights on a
nature of computation turn realized that
the computer program itself could also
be considered as part of the input there
really is no difference between the
program and data we all take that as a
given today we create computer code in a
file that gets stored in the computer no
differently than any other type of file
and data files often have computer
structures embedded in them even modern
computer fonts are basically small
programs that generate readable
characters at arbitrary sizes one
stirring took the view of program code
is data he had the beautiful idea that a
Turing machine could simulate that code
there is some fixed Turing machine a
universal Turing machine that can
simulate the code of any other term
machine again this is an idea that we
take for granted today as we have
interpreters and compilers that can run
the code of any programming language but
back in Turing's day this idea of a
universal machine was a major
breakthrough that allowed Turing and
will allow us to develop problems that
Turing machines or any other computer
cannot solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
