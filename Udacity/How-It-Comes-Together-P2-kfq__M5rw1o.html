set of actions in a state representation
we would like agents to do as well as
they can with that necessarily
questioning what we gave them so so in
this in this case of temporal
detractions again hierarchical
optimality is the notion that the agent
should it should do the best that it can
respecting the high level or temporal to
extract actions that they're given
without having to kind of question
whether it could do better by not
listening to that whole concept right
and you know so maybe it's the case that
we should include in our options every
single primitive action every single
atomic action maybe we don't have to do
that it really just sort of depends upon
what you're trying to accomplish and
what the trade-offs are but we're making
those trade-offs all the time even when
we define the problem in the first place
like a SS that's fair right but in the
same way that once we have all the
machinery of sm dps in place we might as
well just pretend that we're dealing
with MVPs for the kind of purposes of
planning and learning we sort of should
do that with the set of options that we
have in the set of state features that
we have so that's a big win that we're
going to still get optimality it'll be
limited by the set of options that we've
constructed but it was limited by the
set of actions that we had in the first
place there's other things that sort of
fallout from that 1a state abstraction
which you talked about before that
because we have these different options
if we are lucky or clever we might be
able to define options that don't
require that we pay attention to the
entire state or and pay attention to
everything that's going on and if so
that can be a big win but there's also
something else I and I said this on the
first slide because we're able to jump
ahead from one doorway to another
doorway it allows us to avoid wandering
around and say this northeast room right
which means we get to avoid what I'll
call the boring parts of the Markov
decision process the parts of the state
spaces that don't matter because
remember fundamentally in order to do
reinforcement learning we have to worry
about exploration versus exploitation
but the options because they have these
policies built in and because they're
trying to accomplish very specific
things allow us to avoid having to pay
attention to
large parts of the state space so they
actually help us with exploration so so
with the idea that we can focus our
decision-making energy on the places
where those decisions actually have an
impact as opposed to stuff that really
you know there's only run right answer
we don't we shouldn't be thinking about
it right so in fact the word that you
made the word that you mentioned there's
a phrase you use there that I think is
just perfect which is we need to focus
on the places where we can actually make
decisions and because options allow us
to kind of jump forward in time it means
in some very important sense from
planning at that level there are no
decisions to happen here we made the
decision when we decided to execute the
option go to the southern door how it
gets there is its business we're just
assuming that it works in the same way
that when we decided to execute the up
action or the left action we didn't
worry about what was happening while
that action was being executed we didn't
think about it at all those are the
decision points that's what makes the
decision process and that's where we
should be building our computational
energy so insofar as we can jump ahead
in the future we can avoid making
decisions which means we are void doing
exploration and that is a huge win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
