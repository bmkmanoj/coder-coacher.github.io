randomized optimization algorithms that
is really attractive it's it's they're
very interesting to people it has proven
itself time and time and again and it is
this notion of genetic algorithms so the
main insight that's exploited in the
genetic algorithm setting is this so
let's imagine we've got a
two-dimensional space and it's you know
hard for me to actually draw a fitness
surface over two-dimensional space so
just kind of think of this as being one
of those maps those contour maps and so
imagine that we've got one dimension
that X now comes in in these two
different dimensions and what we're
trying to do is find the peak which
happens to be there so what if we
actually evaluate three different points
so these green points here we actually
check what the values are at these
points and what we find is that from
this initial point this green point here
if we increase on dimension two we get a
better value but it's also the case that
starting from that point if we crease on
dimension one we get a better value so
maybe what we ought to do is take kind
of elements of these two solutions these
two inputs and combine them together and
move out on dimension one and dimension
two and maybe that will actually give us
a good score as well and in this
particular case it puts us right in the
base and attraction of the local maximum
so this turns out to be useful in many
spaces especially spaces that can be
specified combinatorially like this
where there's these separate dimensions
that contribute in various ways to the
overall fitness value okay Michael that
sort of makes sense but what does this
have to do with genetics or algorithms
for that matter well it's an algorithm
and that we're doing it's an
optimization algorithm and the genetic
part is because what we're going to do
is we're going to build an analogy with
biological evolution mmm analogies in
particular instead of thinking about
these input points these little green
dots we're going to think of them as
each input point is it like an
individual and a group of them taken
together is like a population it's
really the same idea but we're just
giving it a different name okay the the
idea of local search where you make
little changes to it to an input we're
going to now call that mutation right
where you take an individual and kind of
tweak it a little bit
like we did in the example we did before
where we define the neighborhood as
everyone
difference in every single bit that's
right so the mutations can happen along
neighborhoods it's the same kind of
concept as that okay and then you know
and and you can see that there's the
mutations happening over X so I assume
that you get x-men I think that's a fair
point
I like your science that yeah that's
right it is science the those are all
concepts that we were already using when
we were doing these other randomized
optimization algorithms one thing that's
different though is the notion of
crossover so what the what crossover
does is it takes different points like
this green point in this green point and
instead of moving them just to their own
neighborhood it gives you a way of
combining their attributes together with
the hope of creating something even
better so that is where it starts to
actually kind of deviate from the
standard notion of local search or
randomized optimization and gets us into
something that feels a little bit more
like evolution so this is kind of like
their iced asexual reproduction right
where the two parents can actually form
a new kind of offspring that you know if
you're lucky is has all the positive
attributes of both of the parents like
my children
uh-huh and if you're unlucky it has the
worst attributes of the parents like
other people's children exactly and so
and finally what we were calling
iteration before in the context of
genetic algorithms we can call it a
generation because we're going to take a
population of individuals and kind of
you know made them together to create a
new population of individuals and we're
going to what we hope is improve
iteration by iteration okay that makes
sense so if I can just push on this a
minute it seems like if it weren't for
crossover this is really like doing
random restart except instead of doing
restarts you just do them all at once
because we have parallel computers yeah
I think that's I think that's fair I
think that's quite fair actually okay so
then the thing that makes it more than
that is crossover that somehow these
parallel random searches are bleeding
information back and forth
maybe bleeds the wrong yeah you don't
want to get to biological about this
well so they're sharing fluids
or CLE with one another and conveying
information that way just the way genes
do right and so that's the sort of
interesting concept that now we have
information not just in the individual
like we're moving that one individual
around and trying to find better better
solutions but the population as a whole
represents a distribution over
individuals and that that distribution
might actually be a useful thing to
guide the search for higher scoring
individuals okay then that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
