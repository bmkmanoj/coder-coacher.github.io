constant factor approximation algorithm
unless P equals NP or there are constant
factor approximation algorithms but we
know certain limits for how good that
constant factor can get there are other
problems that allow for what is called a
polynomial time approximation scheme and
the idea behind a polynomial time
approximation scheme is basically that
if you put in more running time into
your algorithm and that algorithm is
called a polynomial time approximation
scheme then you will get a better
solution or a better guarantee for your
solution and depending on how good you
want that guarantee to be there are then
again certain implications for the
running time you have to put in so for a
almost perfect solution you will likely
have to put in time that is very close
to exponential time or even exponential
time and for a solution that is well
maybe only within a rather coarse bound
of an optimal solution you will need
less time now the NP complete problems
that we have encountered so far
obviously fall either into the category
of having a constant factor
approximation algorithm or admitting no
such algorithm and that is why I'm going
to introduce a new and P complete
problem to you now called knapsack a
knapsack is very simple to describe
knapsack gives you as input a set of
objects such as these here and each
object has a size and value and those
are both integer numbers so you have an
integer size and an integer value and
we're soon going to do an example for
this and then additionally you have
given a container and that container has
a limited capacity and that capacity
again is an integer
and the question you're trying to answer
with knapsack is actually very simple
you're trying to ask the question what
is the maximum value that I can put into
this bag here while observing the
limited capacity so the total sum of the
size of the objects that I select to be
in the knapsack so say I select this
object to be in the knapsack and this
one here but I don't want this one here
then that means that the total size of
these two objects cannot exceed the
capacity of the container and among all
other possibilities of putting objects
into the container without exceeding
maximum capacity this gives me the best
possible value and of course here for
the values we again do the sum
to calculate the total value knapsack is
known to be np-complete and now let's do
a little example for this problem just
to familiarize yourself with this and
I'm going to give you a number of
objects here and of course each of these
objects has a size and value now my
question to you is if I give you a
container and that container has size 10
which objects out of these seven years
should be put into the container to
maximize the value without exceeding
this size here please check all the
items that you should put into the
container to maximize the value
