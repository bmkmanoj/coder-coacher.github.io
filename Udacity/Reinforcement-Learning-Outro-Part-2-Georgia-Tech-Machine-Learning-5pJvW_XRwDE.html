more class that of problems that we
didn't really get a chance to get there
are tons by the way just to be clear
algorithms and representation that we
didn't really get into a lot of them
actually coming out of big data like
Katie trees for example but there's a
whole class of problems we didn't really
discuss that it's actually quite
important and that's because it reveals
one of the assumptions that we've had
them so i'm going to call them sort of
the assumption of balanced labels
balanced labels which is related to call
sensitive learning and a variety of a
variety of other things so implicit in a
lot of the work that we talked about was
this idea that you know if you're a big
data set you about half of them are
labeled negative and about half of than
the label positive check right but in
practice the world doesn't work that way
and you have to actually take take that
into account so what would be an example
my favorite exam so imagine you have a
camera closer I have Maddie yeah and
let's say that it's in an airport like
we are now and people are going through
constantly in fact you're in Atlanta
Airport which is the world's busiest
airport and their cameras constantly
taking pictures of you and there are and
we're trying to find tariffs so we're
taking pictures of people and of their
faces say maybe what they're wearing and
we just want to label which one's your
terrorism which ones are well the vast
majority of people are not terrorists we
hope even the ones going through
airports and so let's say 99 percent of
the people that come through you would
label negative and less than 1% you
would label pause does that make sense
as a problem yea though I'm thinking
about this issue about most people
aren't terrorists like I feel like is it
are there really any non pterosaur we
all just terrace who just haven't gotten
inspired yet you've met my son so let's
say terrorist by some definition we're
willing to accept yeah yeah sort of
unless that's about a threat a threat
that's where I was gonna go yes forget
whether they're terrorists are not just
in the airport the airport cares this
person is threatening to the safety of
them in fact we can back it up a little
bit and say it's not even terrace it's
just someone that's gonna cause some
kind of trouble as defined by the
airport so you know we'll get irritated
when they go to
that explains why the last time that we
got together in Atlanta I was chased by
police you were gently that's a funny
story was literally chased by the police
of Atlanta Airport you got out of that
one pretty well at dawn thanks
eventually yeah if we're not happy with
that anyway so anyway so let's say maybe
three percent of people cause trouble in
a day hey Michael yeah and let's say the
other ninety seven percent oh so if you
were gonna throw this at a learner what
would happen uh yeah let the best murder
is probably the one that just says no
one will cost Chapel calls problem right
because it could be wrong sometimes yeah
that's right it'll be wrong sometimes
but very rarely yeah ninety-seven
percent is pretty good well that's a
problem that's the McCall the majority
classifier yes and it's a baseline which
we've talked about talked about a little
bit and the problem is that when your
algorithm does ninety-seven percent
that's actually not very impressive on
the one hand but then what's other issue
which is the understated on this on this
data saucer present but there's this
other issue which is the cost of being
wrong when someone really is going to
cause trouble is much higher so it's
actually very important that you get
that three per if you get that three
percent you can't just treat it treated
as three percent I so I'm going to just
very briefly go through this and we're
going to move on there's a bunch of
approaches to this you could re wait the
way you do error you there's all kinds
of clever things you can do but there's
one that I really like which is due the
polyol and Mike Jones it was applied to
a vision problem it's called cascade
merman I like this because it's a
seminal paper I like this because it's
really good work and also cuz Paul viola
was one of my advisors and Mike Jones
was my office mate when I was in grad
school and I just they did all of this
when I was sitting there and didn't put
me on their paper so you think you
should be on the paper just by virtue of
the fact that you're there inspiring
them with your presence my agents will
go up by one yeah and that's important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
