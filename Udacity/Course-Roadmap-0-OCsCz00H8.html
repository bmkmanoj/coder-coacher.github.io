so many game apps out there already why
would i look for another game to play
when there's already bejeweled and fruit
ninja that's a great question because
even if a new games a lot of fun to play
it won't necessarily be profitable and
its popularity may fade with time
luckily that's what this course is about
we'll talk about three main topics that
will help your game keep its players
coming back and help you make money what
are those topics is on well the first
lesson will be about engagement which is
how to design your game so that people
play it often and stay interested over
time the second lesson will discuss the
different models for monetization like
using ads and in-app purchases and our
third and last lesson will be about
publishing best practices like tests
near game and getting your game noticed
as you go through this course keep in
mind that the best and the easiest way
to make your game profitable is to start
thinking about monetization right away
as you're building a game don't leave it
as the last step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
