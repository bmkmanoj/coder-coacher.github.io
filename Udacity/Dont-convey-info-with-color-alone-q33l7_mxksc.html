that there are roughly 320 million users
with some form of color vision
deficiency to put it another way that
means one in 12 men and one and two
hundred women suffer from some form of
color blindness which affects men much
more substantially than women that also
means that around one out of 20 users of
your site will likely have some form of
color vision deficiency now imagine
telling your manager that one out of 20
users of your site will not be able to
complete the experience that seems like
a conversation that wouldn't go over
very well but when we rely too heavily
on conveying information with color
alone that's effectively what we're
setting ourselves up for to give me an
example here's a form that I filled out
previously but something's wrong can you
spot it alright how about now notice
that the telephone number field is
underlined red signifying that it's
invalid but to a colorblind user or a
screen reader user this information may
not be conveyed and because of this you
should always try to provide multiple
avenues for the user of your site to
access critical information the webbing
checklist specifically states in Section
1 dot 4 dot one that color alone should
not be used as the sole method of
conveying content or distinguishing
visual elements and that color should
not be used to distinguish links from
surrounding text unless they meet
certain contrast requirements which we
covered in our previous lesson instead
the checklist recommends adding an
additional indicator like an underline
to indicate when a link is active so an
easy way to fix that previous example is
just to add an additional message to the
field announcing that it's invalid when
you're building an app try to keep these
sorts of things in mind and watch out
for any areas where you may be relying
too heavily on color to convey important
information if you're curious you can
use the no coffee Chrome extension to
simulate various forms of visual
impairment including different types of
color blindness if you're relying
heavily on the use of color in your UI
you may want to do a pass using a tool
like no coffee to see if there are areas
where you can improve things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
