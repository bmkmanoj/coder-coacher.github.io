here is some advice on the specifics of
Python if you know your way around
Python simply skip this segment to
indicate that the rest of the line is a
comment simply put a hash in front of
that line to create variables simply
type their name and write equals
whatever you want you do not specify the
type of a variable unlike in sea or in
Java or in C++ or in c-sharp python is
going to figure out the type on its own
like JavaScript if you will so that's an
allowed name answer equals 42 radius
underscore off underscore earth is an
allowed name 6.37 one times ten to the
sixth I am writing comment m to say
meters that's the simplest way of
indicating what the measurement unit
would be and you must not start names
with digits 13 test two is not a correct
name the print command prints out what
you have given after it very simple if
you want to specify more things simply
use commas this now shows some basic
rithmatics i'll run it first to discuss
the results 42 is assigned to answer
6.37 something times ten to the sixth is
assigned to radius underscore underscore
earth now we do some computation three
times answer + 4 and the result is
assigned to a variable called a note
that multiplication and division are
executed before plus and minus now we
take the values of Earth to the second
power as to riga stearic represents the
power operator in Python unlike see
unlike Java parentheses work este work
in school and again the pub operator Oh
point five of course meaning this is the
square root that's one way of writing
the square root of a plus three the
result is assigned to
see this is what I output here's the
second one gets pretty ugly the content
of an sighs incremented by seven plus
equals seven that's the same as isn't
see and in Java and in JavaScript the
increment operate on the same works four
minus equals x equals divided equals
what you can do is plus plus unlike see
and its sibling if you want to do plus
plus you have to write plus equals one
this again is similar to see if you
divide integer numbers 5/4 the result is
an integer number let's look that up see
is the fourth one 1 2 3 4 15 by 4 is 1
for Python s is for c and for java and
so on if you want to see floating-point
division at least one of these two
numbers has to be a floating-point
numbers simply write four point let's
look at d second last 1.25 works or 1.0
times 5/4 python starts from the left as
that c is thus java 1.0 times 5 is a
floating point number that's divided by
the integer number reside is a floating
point number keep that in mind this is
something that easily needs to not so
obvious errors there's more to
mathematics then rithmatics to do more
we need to import the math library this
is done best at the start of a program
when we need the square root we then can
write math dot square root of 4 which
actually is the same as for a steric
asterick 0.5 even the sine function it's
math dot sine parentheses the angle of
course this anger is specified in
radians not in angular degrees to
convert from angular degrees to radians
x pi math.pi as a built-in constant / /
180 as lines get longer we may need to
break the line to keep it readable if
there is an open parenthesis you can
break at any point then sometime close
that parenthesis if lines get longer you
may need to break them to make things to
keep things readable Python is picky
about lines you cannot break anywhere
that's unlike C and Java but if there's
an open parenthesis you can break
anywhere Python is going to wait for
that closing parenthesis for the
standard mathematical functions such as
square root and sign we need to import
the math library this is done best at
the beginning of a program and then you
invoke the square root for instance by
typing method square root and the
argument is given in parentheses that's
pretty similar to java and to c sharp
the result of courses to point o we
could also have written fall to the open
fifth power the sine function is math
sine the cosine would be math dot cos
and so on the constant pi is included as
meth dot pi the sine function and it's
friends work with radians not with
angular degrees so if 23.4 is in angular
degrees we need to convert it for
instance by multiplying with pi and
dividing by 180 if lines get longer you
may want to break them to keep things
readable Python is picky about line
breaks that's very much unlike C and
Java you cannot break a line at any
place but if there is at least one open
parenthesis you can break the line this
is what I'm using here if you need
something to be done a given number of
times you can use the for loop which
looks quite different from C first thing
that you notice is a colon at the end no
braces but a call on here at the end of
the first line and indentation the
indentation and that colon replace what
see users know as curly braces what
happens here H starts with 0 it gets 1 2
and so on and at the end it's six and
then the loop
terminates so you do not write for H
equals 0 and so on edge smaller than 7
you write for H in range 7 that's the
Python way let's have a look at the
result so it prints out square numbers
starting with 0 and eventually
terminating it 6 to the second power the
while loop is good for loops that run as
long as something has to be done so in
this case this loop runs as long as k is
less than 130 or m is equal 140 so
unlike see you do not write pi pipe for
you simply spill out or the same for not
and end don't forget the colon so we see
that k runs up to 130 this first
condition fails and the second one is
not true either because m is 7000
something now to conditional execution
if the value of K is larger than 42
don't forget the colon output high a
text string and single quotes else that
means if cave was not larger than 40 to
check if m is Nigel than 43 if so output
hello if not which means if M is not
larger than 43 I would put by and of
course k is larger than 42 mins 130 so
we output high and never see the rest
the else is optional and the eds if is
optional we need to work with long lists
of data this package called numpy comes
in handy here numpy dot zeros creates a
one-dimensional array in this case with
five entries numbered from 0 to 4 like
in c yeah i changed the entry number 0
and here i change the entry number 4
which is the last entry I print the
complete array and here I print the
ultimate entry this comes in very handy
and is different from sea and other
languages so the complete array contains
20000 99 because I changed the entry
number zero and I changed the entry
number four and the entry number if you
will minus one is simply the last one
often we do not get away with
one-dimensional lists we have to use two
dimensional tables this creates a table
that's filled with zeros and has two
rows and three columns here I change the
entry that's in the upper row row number
zero and in the middle column column
number 1 columns range from 0 on 22 27
and here I change the entry in the lower
roll the rows are 0 and 1 and in the
rightmost column 28 I output that and
then I do some arithmetic with matrices
that is we are going to cover that later
one plus twice the complete table that
are built here let's look at the output
so that's our array 0 7 0 is the row
number 0 0 0 8 is the row number one we
changed the entry second column row
number 128 lets this guy and here i
computed 1 plus twice the array as above
the seven becomes 1 plus 2 times 7 15
the eight becomes 1 plus 2 times 8 17
this again is something that you can't
do with regular arrays in c or in java
this comes very handy for mathematics
and there's one more thing that
resembles arrays in c and arrays in Java
if you think you copy that array you
didn't actually create a copy you just
created a reference to the very same
thing and memory so yeah I seem to
create a copy q equals P I change the
copy to make the left the topmost left
entry equal to 42 and then I output p
and you see if i look at p it to as the
value of 42 in here there is just one
instance of that array in memory both q
and p refer to the same instance in
memory this is how we define functions
in Python we say def for define function
name the parameters that we want to end
over to the function call on and then
comes what the function should do again
of course with indentation and you call
this function like you call math dot
sign and other built-in functions with
parenthesis similar to c and java so in
this case you is set to 1 we compute 2
times you are becomes too and we return
to plus one equals three and in this
case it's seven you set to seven r
becomes 14 and we return 14 plus seven
that is 21</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
