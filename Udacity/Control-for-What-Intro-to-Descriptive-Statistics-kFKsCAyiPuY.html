memory capabilities due to gender in
this particular test to do this we could
divide the group into males and females
and then see how sleep influences memory
in both groups we want the amount of
sleep to vary amongst individuals so
that we can see how their memory is
related to that we are controlling for
variation in people's individual memory
capabilities because by using the same
person twice we're doing what's called a
within subject design that way we can
see how sleep influences memory for the
same person and by using the same person
twice we're keeping a lot of other
things constant including this variation
in people's individual memory
capabilities we're also not controlling
for the time of day in this study but
this would be a good thing to add on to
the within subject study we could tell
our subjects to sleep a lot then take
the memory test at the same time the
next day as everyone else like 3 o'clock
then again we can tell people to sleep a
little and then take the memory test at
the same time of day again at 3 o'clock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
