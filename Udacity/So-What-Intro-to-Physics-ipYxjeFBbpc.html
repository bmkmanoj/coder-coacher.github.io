who cares about this phase diagram
you're in for a treat notice that when I
pick out a point on this circle and
remember this circle tells us all the
locations in what we can call phase
space which is some combination of
position and velocity all the locations
in phase space where we might find this
object let's look at this point for
example well this point corresponds to a
position down here and to a velocity
over here well I'm seeing something very
fascinating right now let's just draw a
line from the center over to here let's
draw a line from the center out to the
point we're talking about oh I think
you're seeing it too now well check it
out this point has an angle associated
with it I'm going to call that angle
theta it has an opposite side and the
length of this opposite side well that
corresponds to this length over here
same as the velocity v over v max and
this triangle has an adjacent side and
this adjacent side corresponds to the
position of the particle or the block at
this instant in time another great thing
is that since we've chosen to write
these speeds and positions as ratios of
x over x max and v over v max this
circle has radius 1 the hypotenuse is
just one that's such an easy number to
deal with now can you figure out a very
important equation namely what
trigonometric function goes here and
which goes here I'll give you a hint
it's either sine cosine or tangent and
it's either sine cosine or tangent so is
x over x max the sine of theta the
tangent of theta cosine fill in your
answers here in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
