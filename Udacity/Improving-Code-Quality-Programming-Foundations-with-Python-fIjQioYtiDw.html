why my computer science professor from
college may be upset with the quality of
this code the first is that I'm doing
something repetitive inside my code
things like move forward turn right move
forward turn right I do that four times
but I don't use any sort of a loop
another reason is that the name of my
function is draw square which I do but
then I go ahead and draw a circle inside
that function also that doesn't seem
quite logical to me so based on those
two ideas what changes would you make to
the code that we've written thus far to
make it more usable I want you to make
those changes and then upload a
screenshot of the code to the discussion
forum here's an extra credit assignment
which is to create a third turtle and
this one will draw a triangle once
you're done with that I want you to
upload a screenshot of the new output to
the discussion forum make sure you check
this box after you've submitted your
responses to the forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
