with organizations that are going
through a DevOps transformation in that
change model we begin with an event we
do something in the organization that is
new or different this can be the
automation of infrastructure it could be
automated test coverage it could be any
number of things that we do to improve
our release practice on the basis of
that event we have new language now so
often what you'll get from the
organization is that we can't do X or Y
that's not possible and so as the change
agent as the as the devops engineer
inside of your organization you then go
and do this thing that was that had
previously been believed to be
unpossible and now we have new language
in the organization the even if the
language had been no prior now the
language is oh okay I guess that is a
thing we can do from from that
perspective now structure inside the
organization begins to give way and as
that does you have more agency more
flexibility more freedom to act in that
space and so you have event language
structure agency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
