to complete in this problem let's go
through them one by one first things
first the moon position function now we
asked you to start the moon off at moon
initial angle so we defined moon angle
or the angle of the moon at any given
time as moon initial angle plus two pi
times the time that has passed divided
by the total period of the moon so this
is basically the fraction of its orbit
that the moon has gone through so far we
then created a two dimensional array for
the moon's position what looks like the
horizontal position in this drawing is
equal to the distance between the Earth
and the moon or moon distance times the
cosine of Moon Ingle and the vertical
position is the same except uses sine
instead so next comes the function for
the acceleration of the spacecraft now
let's talk about gravity for a second we
know that the gravitational force that
one body feels as a result of another
body is dictated by Newton's law of
universal gravitation now we know that
our spaceship is going to be pulled
toward the earth and also toward the
moon so we need to take into account how
this acceleration will be affected by
both of these objects since we're
interested in acceleration rather than
force we can use Newton's second law
along with this law of gravitation to
come up with an expression for the total
acceleration of the spaceship to figure
this out however we need information
about the relative position of our three
objects so we started in the
acceleration function by declaring a new
variable called moon pose which is just
equal to the moon's position at any
given time now we can define a vector
from the moon to the spaceship this
green vector right here is just the
position vector of the spacecraft - moon
pose since moon pose is just the
position vector of the moon then we can
define a new variable called AK or at
least that's how I'm going to pronounce
this word using the equation for the
acceleration due to gravity we really
owe Isaac Newton a lot of credit in this
problem considering reusing two of his
different laws so we can see modifying
his law of gravitation using a second
law gives us an expression for the
vector sum of the total acceleration of
the spacecraft here everything with a
subscript s stands for spacecraft now
our next task was to make the velocity
changes happen if the first shift in
velocity has not happened yet
but it's after the time at which was
supposed to happen that may decrease the
velocity by 7.04 m/s but keep the
spaceship moving in the same direction
by dividing our quantity by the norm of
the velocity vector and then multiplying
by this vector again we do pretty much
the same thing for boost but this time
we replace the time with the correct
value two hundred twelve thousand one
hundred seconds in each case since
you've changed the velocity in the ways
prescribed you can change the proper
boolean's to true
now finally we get expressions for
velocity and position using hoynes
method right here we have a simple
translation of these equations into
Python we can see Euler values with the
ease and hoynes values with the h's at
the end of this we set velocity and
position equal to velocity age and
position age so that each time we go
through another iteration they will
shift to equal the new Hoynes values now
in order to adjust the step size for
each position of the spacecraft needs to
the difference between Hawaiians and
Euler's values for position and velocity
you'll remember that we used these to
calculate the air then the new step size
is set as prescribed here in this line
of code since we are finishing up the
step in which H the current step size is
valid we add those to the current time
and now that the next time step is about
to happen we set H equal to H new
updating its value so this explains why
we use H in the equations for hawaiians
method but are still able to let the
value cycle since our program is now
complete we can run it using different
values for boost we give you zero as a
value to start out with but let's try a
negative ten first so we can check out
one extreme of the range that we gave
you with a boost of negative 10 meters
per second we can tell that the ship is
pretty far away from touching the earth
and then when we extend the path out
again it travels past the moon's orbit
we can clearly tell that this is not
right we definitely want to make sure
that the crew actually gets back to the
earth not just circled around again
let's try a different value
now since 100 is the largest value that
we gave you to try let's see what
happens with that well this certainly
looks different from the last plot that
we saw though this also doesn't look
exactly right so up close we can tell
that it looks like the ship is actually
crashing
into the earth and that's definitely not
what we want to happen either they
wanted to just barely skim the surface
zooming out again you can see that the
tail the trajectory doesn't reach out to
the radius of the moon's orbit like we
said that it would so the correct value
for Boost is in between these two values
at 10 m/s here is the solution plot this
looks perfect you can see that the
spaceship takes off loops around the
moon comes back and just grazes the
surface the earth and then if we let it
go out again it would return to exactly
the same radius that it left to
initially this is a really complex
problem so great job for getting it done
I'm sad that we're done talking about
spaceships and orbits but get excited
for unit 3 we're going to talk about how
diseases spread through populations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
