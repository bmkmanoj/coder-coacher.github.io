available to make closure expressions
super concise in fact this is one of the
coolest aspects of closure expressions
in Swift and at times one of the most
confounding I want to walk you through
some of these tricks using the filter
method from the array class the filter
method is called by an instance of the
array class as an argument it takes in a
condition and returns an array that's
been filtered based on that condition
the condition is passed in as a closure
here I have an array of exam grades I'm
going to filter this array for all the
grades above 70 will call those grades
passing grades so I call the filter
method with the object exam grades and I
pass in a closure representing the
filter condition the closer takes in a
grade and int and returns a bool
representing whether the condition is
true at this point this looks a lot like
the syntax we saw for sorted here's the
first trick the compiler can infer
closure expression types based on what
parameter type a given function expects
in this case the compiler can infer that
the closure expression for filter will
take in a parameter that matches the
type of the array being filtered and the
compiler can also infer that this
closure will return a bowl that means we
can leave out the words int and bool and
still get the same result here in the
sidebar you can see what the result is
if we filter for failing grades on to
the next trick if a closure is a single
expression like this one it can be
inferred that the result of that
expression should be returned so we can
remove the word return again in the
sidebar you can see that our filter
still works and now for the trick that's
been known to make some code readers
head spin shorthand argument names swift
provides default argument names for
closure expressions so instead of
specifying a first argument the first
argument is known as dollar signs ero
the second argument is known as dollar
sign one and so on so here for example
the compiler can infer that this closure
expression takes one argument and that
its type int matches the type of the
elements in the array so we don't have
to give it a name grade we just use the
default name for the first argument
dollar signs you
zero and since we're not giving grade a
name anymore we can omit the word grade
along with the word in let's see all
those shortcuts again one more time
we'll go back to the alphabetical soup
example from your quiz the closure
expression parameter and return types
can be inferred so we can take out
string string and bool since this is a
single expression closure it can be
inferred that it returns the result of
that single expression so we can also
leave out return we can use the
shorthand argument names for soup 1 and
soup too and we're left with a statement
that truly is amazingly concise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
