wanted to talk about sunshine great app
isn't it yeah it's it's a great learning
exercise and with a little more polish
it could be a great prototype out of
tape I thought we were done with
sunshine wasn't that what the great
party was all about well you're half
right it was a great party look sunshine
does function but we've got a long way
to go before its production ready
remember it's that last 10% of Polish
and those unique features that make all
the difference to real users get it
ready for real users and then you'll be
ready for your own lab coat maybe well
sure I had a couple things in mind that
we didn't get to great I thought you'd
have some ideas and I've brought in some
extra help for you to get it done you
need to go talk to the fix-it team so I
guess I should be leaving now here's to
more sunshine so I've got this app and
it's not production quality and students
are watching and I need your help
sure we can take a look well this is
certainly functional um and we can work
with you to help you make it production
ready awesome what do we need to do get
started I think I'd be good to hear from
you on exactly where sunshine is now no
time like the present
let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
