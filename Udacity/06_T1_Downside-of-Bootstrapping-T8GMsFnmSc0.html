your soul in a lot of ways you have to
have a thick thick skin because people
are going to tell you that you know what
you're doing isn't valuable or they're
not going to see your perspective so you
have to have resolute belief in your
core goal for your for you to be
successful in this space yeah
bootstrapping is often looked at as or
it can be looked at as you're crazy or
that's never going to work or you know
how could anybody find value in that
you'll hear a lot of naysayers and I
think it's it's overcoming the mental
games both externally and internally
that are what makes bootstrapping heart
you can't listen to the negative voices
that are are telling you you can't do it
if you started off with a belief that
you can test that theory all the way
through you owe it to yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
