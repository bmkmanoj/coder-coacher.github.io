but this one's going to move our
understanding forward a little bit more
so here's a little bit of Python code a
subroutine called countdown takes a
input X it executes a statement and then
it goes into a while loop and repeats
these two statements some number of
times and then when that's all done it
does one more statement so we can take
for any given input so like this print
countdown 50 we could count up the time
the number of statements executed for
this 2x and it'd be something like this
so we didn't talk about the number of
steps that it takes to do a print
statement if there's a subroutine but
we're going to call it one for the print
statement plus however many steps it
takes to execute the subroutine call so
in this case countdown 50 what is it
going to do there's going to be one call
there - for each time then it counts
down which is going to be what ten times
right starts off at 50 going to go down
by 5's until it hits zero there's going
to be ten times that it's executing
these two statements so that's 20 21 22
and the print statement is 23 so this if
we ask the time that this takes it's
going to be 23 units here's the trickier
question what if we just say we don't
know what n is someone's going to tell
us and later we'd like to know the
number of steps the amount of time that
it takes to execute this formula as a
function of n we can't automatically
grade a mathematical function or maybe
we can so the way that we're going to
score this quiz is instead of you
telling me a mathematical expression for
this function I want you to actually
give me a function function that takes
as input n and produces his output the
number of time steps that it will take
to execute countdown or this entire
block of code here all right if we
already figured out what happens when n
is 50 but we want a general form of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
