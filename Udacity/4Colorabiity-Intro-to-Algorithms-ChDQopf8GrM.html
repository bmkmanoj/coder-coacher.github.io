it is in NP and it is np-hard so it is
np-complete for color ability is
np-complete and the reasons are well so
this one's true we can in fact quickly
verify a certificate that lists the
color assignments we actually did that
in general already earlier in the unit
so so yeah for color ability is
definitely in NP it's not necessarily an
NP because the number of colors is
bigger and well know this the first
argument is the correct one it's not
necessarily NP hard because having four
colors to work with makes things easier
that is kind of true it four colors does
give you a little bit more slack and
there's things that you can for color
that you can't three color but this
argument is less compelling than the
next argument that says that it is
np-hard and the reason for that is
because a solution to four color ability
solve three color ability so if you give
me a graph and say is this three
colorable and to help you out I'll give
you an algorithm for solving for color
ability all I need to do is add a node
to the graph connect that note to every
other node in the graph that means that
that new node is going to have to have a
different color than everything else in
the graph and now you say okay is this
graph for colorable and if it is for
colorable then the color for this newly
added node will be different from all
the other ones so the rest of the graph
has been three colored so we've actually
solved three color ability and that's
why knowing that three color abilities
np-hard tells us for color abilities NP
hard and no no since all since any graph
that is three colorable is for color
well that's true that doesn't make them
equivalent because it would also have to
go the other way every four colorable
graph would also have to be three
colorable and that's just not true so
this is actually the proof that for
color ability is np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
