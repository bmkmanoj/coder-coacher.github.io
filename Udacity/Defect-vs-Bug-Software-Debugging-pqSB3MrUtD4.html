systematically the situation we are in
is classical we do have a program the
program gets some input and out pops a
failure that can be seen by the user
what is a failure in here a failure is
an error an error that's externally
visible that is visible by the user what
is an error an error is something that
deviates from what's correct right or
true errors are typically unwanted and
unintended failures are errors a defect
is also error a defect however is
somewhere in the code the defect is what
turns an otherwise valid input in the
end into a failure
the term defect is an error in the code
as in several synonyms some people also
call this a fault but then a fault can
also be applied to data the by far most
common word for defect however is of
course bug there's a bug in my code
somewhere as if this had somehow crawled
into my code here is this foreign bug
this is my code it doesn't belong there
that's okay
in the end it's us programmers who are
actually introducing these bugs in there
and so I very much prefer the term
defect the aim of debugging is to find
the defect that causes the problem for
this when you look a little bit deeper
into how a program actually executes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
