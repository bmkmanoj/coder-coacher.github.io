at the handle single tap method for the
breakpoint bug view controller and I'll
go ahead and run our first command that
we saw so breakpoint set file will use
bug factory dot Swift and a line 126
enter and when I hit enter you'll notice
that it assigns the breakpoint a number
this is going to be brick point two but
it doesn't change anything in Xcode UI
if we actually go to the bug factory we
don't see a breakpoint here on line 26
now that's okay the breakpoint actually
does exist it just exists in the console
session and the UI does not update maybe
that's something they'll add later but
for now just know that your breakpoint
does exist and if we hit continue and
continue the application we can see that
we've dropped in and that we've hit
breakpoint 2 now for the next command
well do our let me clear out again well
you use breakpoint set and this time
will pass the selector option and
viewdidload so this is a little strange
it says that our breakpoint 3 is 23
locations and that's a lot of
breakpoints
but that's kind of the point setting
breakpoints on selectors manually would
be very tedious so you can imagine if we
had say 23 view controllers we would
have to click through each file so like
print see the print bug view controller
and go to viewdidload and set it here
but I'm not going to do that right now
we'd have to do it for this one and so
on and so forth so this saves us a lot
of time and this is another good reason
to know how to use the command line so
let's continue the app and see if we
reach one of the 23 breakpoints we're
still stuck in create bug oh that's
right that's because we're creating way
too many bugs so before we can continue
we need to disable this or else I'm
gonna have to hit play a bunch of times
so since there's no UI element to
actually disable this we're gonna have
to do it through the command line so
I'll type breakpoint
and there's a sub command disabled and
then we pass in
the number of the break point so break
point - and this should disable our
break point and now we'll hit play and
should be back there we go so we're back
at the running State and so to trigger
any of the viewdidload break points that
we set we're gonna have to load a new
view so let's go back to the main view
and then go to the break point bugging
to view again and it's stopped us on
break point three and if we pull back a
little bit we can see that stack frame
one is that you did load so it indeed
did drop us in into a viewdidload break
point so let's demonstrate the last two
from this exercise we'll go back to the
break point bug view controller and
let's add an original or let's add a
break point to the add bug - view method
I'll hit play there we go let's clear
this out so now we'll do break point
list a great point list let's drag this
up see everything we're looking at
it's our first break point set in break
point bug view controller on handle
single tap then we have the line break
point that we set on line 26 and here's
the viewdidload selector so we can see
that it's set a bunch we have a bunch of
different view data loads for all these
different UI kit classes so that's
pretty cool and there's one other thing
on the show this is actually another
really neat thing you can see hit count
so it actually shows us how many times
we've reached a certain breakpoint so
this could be really useful information
you can imagine that in certain cases
you might want to know this
and for the last breakpoint or I'm sorry
for the last command we'll do thread
back trace all and this is the command
line equivalent of all the stack trace
information that we have available to us
over here in the navigator so we can see
for the red one we have there should be
frame 0 1 2 and then 17 oh wow it shows
us even more information ok maybe that's
because I don't have all our options
here no wrong option so I believe
there's an option to show there we go
this will show only stack frames with
debug symbols and between libraries so
we don't have symbols for these
particular frames but we
see way more information with this of
particular icon conflict and then for
threat to open him up
we have frame 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and then the next
thread thread 8 we have 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 as well
I think that's gonna be the same
yeah for a thread 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
