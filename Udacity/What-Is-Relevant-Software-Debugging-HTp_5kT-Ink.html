from the very beginning as an example
consider bug reports if you ever
maintain a big piece of software with
dozens and dozens and maybe even
thousands and thousands of users you may
have gotten feedback from these users
that is bug reports in the early 2000 I
co-authored the debugger named new DDD
it was pretty successful so had many
users and I also got lots and lots of
bug reports from the field these bug
reports even in these early times of
course came by electronic mail but
drawing actual snail mail is cuter some
of these bug reports would just contain
the required information such as the
steps needed to reproduce the problem as
well as the observe behavior but then
there would also be people who would
send in their entire programs that they
were currently debugging some would send
in their entire home directory or even
the content of their entire hard disk
just in case this would be needed to
reproduce the problem and others would
send in just a one-liner your program
crashed which was less information that
I would need what you'd like to have in
a bug report is information that is
relevant and here relevant means if it's
different then it changes the behavior
of course when users are submitting bug
reports they don't necessarily know
whether their information changes the
behavior so to stay on the safe side
they supply more information than would
actually be required but in order to
have a simple bug report or a simple
test case we want information in there
to be relevant and this calls for a quiz
when we simplify a test case just as we
did before for the HTML input then
everything is what simple correct
relevant or elegant over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
