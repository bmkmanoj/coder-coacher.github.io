slower person is but we know the slower
person takes 12 hours and the faster
person takes only six hours great
algebra skills for getting that one
correct we'll start solving this
equation by multiplying through by the
lowest common denominator which is four
x times X minus 6 the product of these
denominators when we multiply through by
the LCD will find that the X cancels in
the first term the X minus 6 cancels in
the second term and then on the
right-hand side of the equation the four
is simplify to 1 this leaves us with 4
times X minus 6 here 4x4 our second term
and then x times X minus 6 on the right
hand side next we'll distribute this
positive 4 and this X to get our next
equation will combine the 4 X on the
left and the right to get 8x minus 24
equals x squared minus 6x now we're
almost to our quadratic expression that
we can factor we just need to subtract 8
X and add 24 to both sides of the
equation this gives us 0 on the left
side x squared minus 14x plus 24 on the
right side now we want to find factors
of positive 24 that's sum to negative 14
those factors are negative 2 and
negative 12 we set each of these factors
equal to 0 and then we solve for x so we
find the values of x equals 2 or x
equals 12 and this might be confusing
which answer should we take before we've
always had at least one of the answers
be negative so we could eliminate it
since a negative time didn't make sense
the key is that one person is six hours
slower than the other so if someone was
six hours slower than someone who could
work two hours we'd wind up with a
negative time so this one would be out
this means that the slower person must
take 12 hours and the faster person
could do it in six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
